Garland's speech yesterday and President Biden labelin' Trump as the undisputed leader of the #January6th attack sounds like a one-two punch kickin' off 2022 as the year of accountability for those who sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

PARENT COMMENT:
Damn straight!  I stand with Joe.   I don't like everything he has done.  I won't pretend that he hasn't made some mistakes.   But, I'll take him over the former guy everyday of the week.  At least, when he makes a mistake, he owns it.  Unlike the former guy, he's trying to make this country better.
