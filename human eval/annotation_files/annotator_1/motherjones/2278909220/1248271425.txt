No, I've been hanging out in the comments sections on Mother Jones long enough to see plenty of low-rent right-wing trolls like you come and go, doofus.  You aren't special enough to stalk.  It just comes as no surprise at all that you're one of those right-wing trolls who feels the need to proselytize on behalf of willful ignorance.  So before you're advocating torture, and now you're trying to tell people how awesome plagues are - what's next, are you going to go onto Democratic Underground to tell people how awesome it is to swim in lava?


As for name calling...  fuck you, you right-wing blowhard.  Don't pretend that you're worthy of respect from anyone.  You're a two-bit political-hack troll pushing disinformation and lies wherever you go.  I'd accuse you of being a paid troll, but they only pay the ones with some small measure of talent for lying.

It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

PARENT COMMENT:
Please stalker...feel free to keep your rigid myopic view away from me. I wish you no harm and am okay that you have different conclusions on matters.

The name calling...is uncalled for. 

Good day.



Oh and, while you're at it...go sit next to Miranda Barbour while she's unrestrained, and, armed.

  I could not agree more...IMO It is no different than child abuse.

    It's worse.

With child neglect or abuse, the individual is typically only harming his and her own child- or possibly a neighbors.

These deluded people are potentially harming, maiming and killing thousands.

      Nonsense. That sort of ridiculous claim is as bad as the paranoia spread about vaccines. 

Further, if there is enough of a body of individuals in a community, who have refused inoculation of themselves and their children...they're in agreement on the matter that they'd rather risk natural exposure than whatever threat they perceive exists in a vaccination. 

They've accepted it amongst themselves, that, should they encounter and incur contagion, the outcome is their responsibility. 

In other words...they're only harming themselves. If you and yours have been boosted against infection, good for you. But that moral argument, accusing them of endangering one another, why, you might as well come down on motorists for the shared risk of being on a highway with others.

        Case in point ^


Advocacy of willful child neglect via scientific illiteracy, self centered bluster and irony impaired analogy.

          Confidence in the immune system, in a natural physiological response...is not an act of scientific illiteracy. It is, weighing the risk of a perceived threat, whether it actually exists of not...and putting one's confidence in the body's ability to deal with infection. As I said...unless there is something immediately life threatening, the chance of infection is just, part of living. 

But lets cut through the moral argument of neglect and get to the heart of it...all children, the individual that they are, ultimately, are going to end. By your position, the very act of bringing a life into the world is neglect. At the end of the day, there is no way to extend their life to a point of being immortal. There is no way to prevent their end. Why would anyone bring in a life, that, has no choice but to one day...be no more?

Weighing that, against the every day possibility of infection...I'd say giving birth is the worst form of neglect possible.

            Is there a left-leaning site anywhere on the internet that you don't go onto just to say dumb shit?  Is there really some moral imperative for stupid right-wingers to go out and spread the stupid to people who aren't already infected?
