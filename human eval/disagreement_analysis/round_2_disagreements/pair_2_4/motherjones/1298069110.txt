Found this site <i>"simply by accident, just wanting to read this one article?"</i>  Yeah, really?  That must be why you were trolling on MoJo Seventeen days ago?  In between all your screaming on CNN about all the other <b>"TROLLS THAT YOU HAVE TO SHOUT ABOUT?"</b>

Jeesh... about the only thing worse than an asshole troll is one like yourself that lies to make his crazy points...  You have been found out... you are found wanting... and are called out for what you are.  Get a life jackass, and quit all this creepiness you seem to be grooving on...

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

PARENT COMMENT:
I found this site simply by accident, just wanting to read this one article, out of curiosity, and I couldn't believe all the hate-mongering that was going on here. The little guy with spiritual faith was taking a beating from the liberal atheists, so I decided to step in. Only wanted to make a few comments and move on, but then the liberal atheists started attacking me, and so, I am still here, hoping to finish and go on to bigger and more important things, like Big Ag, Factory Farming, Animal Cruelty, Monsanto, GMO's, Government Conspiracies, 911 Cover-Ups and the list just keeps on growing about the continued loss of our freedoms. Any of these things important to you, but the way?

BTW, what does Jesus the Rational really stand for? Just asking.

The biggest issue here isn't just HL, but if this goes for them, expect to see all sorts of similar issues crop up.  Company ran by Jehovah Witnesses?  No blood transfusions for you! Christian Scientists? Absolutely no surgery for you, even if you die. Muslim bosses?  Well, we're now testing everyone and if you eat pork no medical insurance!  That's the whole point of "equal protections"...if you let one group be special like this, then anyone can make similar claims.

  Free choice. You don't have to work for them. Their business is not about us, it is about them, it's their money. If they can't hire enough people, they will have to bend with the winds of change or die. Pretty simple really. You worry too much.

    Seriously, Bob. Do you do ANYTHING else besides comment here? The prolificness of your commentary in this thread makes me worry that you don't have anyone in your life to actually talk to. For that I am sorry.
