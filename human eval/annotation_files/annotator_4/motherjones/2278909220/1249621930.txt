It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

PARENT COMMENT:
Risks either way, as you understand.  But, that being the case, only people with an arrogant chip on their shoulder, such as yourself, insists that their solution must be forcefully applied to all other people.

Nice try at a redirect.  You still aren't addressing the questions because you don't have the knowledge fund to do so.  Which is why you point fingers in all sorts of other directions except at the physiology and science.  You want to talk either instead of just flinging insults and smoke, I'll be waiting.

And by the way -- I caught your rewrite up above.  You tried to do some research, and then went back and added some more "technical" terms.  Trying to make history into something it wasn't by editing it after the fact.  You people are all the same.  You are only interested in appearing to be right.  You actually have no interest in whether you are actually right.  You work for the current administration, don't you?

The piece of journalism seems to be pro-vaccine and not unbiased. However I could be biased. I do not vaccinate my children for many reason. I sign a exemption for ethical reasons because mercury and formaldehyde are poisons. That is just two of the many toxic ingredients in vaccines. So it is ridiculous and extremely dangerous to put highly dangerous chemicals and  heavy metals in infants, children's, and adults bodies. It is beyond me that there is anyone who still buys this insanity. The question is why are there so many childhood diseases now compared to before the ramped up vaccine schedule? How come pharmaceutical companies are protected from getting into legal trouble for vaccine injury. That is criminal. My children never get ill, we are perfectly healthy because we protect and boost our immune systems, and we avoid all poisons that we can. All states should make it easy for parents to avoid putting toxic poisons in their children's bodies.

  "I sign a exemption for ethical reasons because mercury and formaldehyde are poisons."

Childhood vaccines don't contain mercury with one exception, muti-dose flu shots.  The amount of mercury in a multi-dose flu shot is around 1/1000th what a child would get from eating a tuna sandwich.

Formaldehyde is a common chemical we are all exposed to on a daily basis.  It's in car exhaust, paper towels, toilet paper, and trace amounts are in the air of a typical house.  The risks from formaldehyde are from large exposures, a kid is exposed to more from blowing their nose into a tissue than getting a vaccine.

There are a lot of good reasons to get vaccinated.  There are many diseases that the human immune system can't fight off, like polio.  Thanks of vaccines we haven't seen many of these diseases in generations, but if people stop vaccinating they will raise their ugly head again.

The anti-vaccine industry is profiting off fear mongering at the risk of crippling, blinding, and killing kids.  Their greed is far, far worse than anything the pharmaceutical industry does (and big pharma doesn't really like vaccines, disease prevention is not nearly as lucrative as the high profits for disease treatments).

    Oh my God.  The stench of your ignorance is so thick I can taste it.

"There are many diseases that the human immune system can't fight off, like polio."  Where did you get that bullshit?  Did you learn it from some of the above posters full of equal parts righteous anger and ignorance?

How about you try looking it up?  Given your comment about polio, one would think rates of complications would be high, no?

Here.  I'll even make it easy for you:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis

Here's the money shot: "Although approximately 90% of polio infections cause no symptoms at all"  -- now, how do you suppose that can happen unless the immune system is fighting it off?

And what are the rates of damage from polio infections?  0.1 - 0.5%.  Given the consequences of this infection still nothing to scoff at, but that means that 99.5% of people get the infection and "fight it off."

Your body is a pretty amazing thing.  With a robust immune system.  It's sad that so many people consider it a wimpy thing that can't exist without the medical system constantly interfering with it.

      I don't think you have even a rudimentary understanding of how immunization works.  The whole point of vaccines is to strengthen the immune system so that there is an immediate immunoresponse to dangerous pathogens.  That's the point - vaccines train the immune system to immediately attack dangerous diseases.

You also seemed to stop reading the Polio article after that sentence.  Read the whole thing, you might learn something.  Your claim that the immune system magically controls where polio infections take hold in the body is magical thinking.

        Where did I "claim that the immune system magically controls where polio infections take hold in the body"?  Can you point to the sentence I used that indicates this please?

"I don't think you have even a rudimentary understanding of how immunization works" -- Riiiiiight....  This coming from the person using Oh-So-Technical terms such as "strengthen the immune system".....

So.  What's your opinion on how effective an IM vaccination will be against organisms that utilize a mucosal surface invasion route?  Any thoughts on what type of immunity would be lacking from such an IM vaccination strategy?  And any thoughts on whether such a strategy leaves certain parts of the immune system unactivated and therefore results in incomplete immunity?

I'm all ears.

There's the magical thinking, right there.

"What's your opinion on how effective an IM vaccination will be against organisms that utilize a mucosal surface invasion route?"

My opinion is that it's irrelevant.  Vaccines should be injected either in the muscle or subcutaneously based on what's appropriate for the vaccine.  That's really just a question of appropriate clinical practice.  How it's injected has little bearing on what it's immunizing against, only on making sure you get the right seroconversion rate for the type of vaccine.

Why bring up a red herring?  Just to put on a facade of knowing things you're clearly ignorant of?

            "There's the magical thinking, right there" -- Where?  Because I'm quoting wikipedia?  Tell me einstein -- if you have an infection and then it goes away, how does it go away unless your immune system fights it off?  Please elaborate.


"My opinion is that it's irrelevant.... only making sure you get the right seroconversion rate for the type of vaccine" -- so obviously you don't have any knowledge about the different types of immunity.  You can stimulate humoral immunity with vaccines injected into the bloodstream, but you won't stimulate mucosal, now will will you?  So, if you have an infection that is confined to the mucosal surface like influenza or most of the childhood diseases, how effectively will you protect against them if you are not stimulating any IgA, but only IgG and IgM, Hmmmm?


That's right, you won't.  You can reduce the chance you get viremic or bacterimic, but you won't prevent yourself from getting a mild infection until you generate enough IgA response, which is why vaccines lead to children being carriers of various illnesses even though they don't have serious symptoms, while those children who actually get the disease develop IgA and thus clear it completely.  Vaccinations thus produce at best partial and incomplete immunity, which is why they are designed to protect the person, not prevent transmission.


Vaccines are being asked to do something (prevent transmission) that they are, by their very design, not designed to do.


But, if you had any real knowledge about physiology, you would know this.  But, that's most people on this page -- very opinionated when in fact all they are doing is parroting back the liturgy of the church of science.

                Wow, didn't take long to get to the bottom of your knowledge fund, did it.

Classic liberal.  The strength of your opinions always inversely correlates with your level of knowledge about a subject.  But, that sure doesn't dissuade you from feeling righteous about imposing your foolish and shortsighted short cuts on the rest of society, does it...

Anytime you want to actually address the issues I raised, rather than just flinging distractions and accusations in all directions, you let me know.

                  No, it's really just that I have no respect for your pretentious little game.  If I ever wanted to discuss the matter seriously, a stranger on the internet spouting misinformation isn't who I'd turn to, though thanks for the offer.  Lay off the lies about peanut allergies, they are an obvious sign that you're regurgitating anti-vaxxer dogma without any understanding of what you're talking about.

When I was in elementary school one of the kids I was in with contracted Polio in 1st grade.  It got into his nervous system.  He walked with braces, had a speech impediment, had limited use of his right arm, was taunted by the kids for it, and was in a lot of needless pain because his parents were anti-vaxxers.  Morons who condemned their kid to a broken life out of rank stupidity.  I wasn't vaccinated either, my parents were irresponsible nut-cases on that one.  I got lucky, and I know it.  So, sorry, I know you wish people would treat you respectfully as you advocate harming, crippling, blinding, and killing kids, but no, you are a tool, a low-life, and nobody to take seriously as anything but a threat to kids.  Your pretenses of cleverness just make you all the more despicable.
