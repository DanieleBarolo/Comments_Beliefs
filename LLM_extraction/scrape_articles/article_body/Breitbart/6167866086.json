I was somewhat surprised that the president came out attacking NFL players for them exercising the freedom of speech. While I don’t condone the protest during our national anthem, this is America. If our country stands for anything, folks, it’s freedom. People die for that freedom.”He continued, “I’m not sure if our president understands those rights, that every American has the right to speak out and also to protest.”Bradshaw added that Trump “should concentrate on serious issues like North Korea and health care.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter@pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/09/24/terry-bradshaw-not-sure-trump-understands-every-american-right-speak-protest/"}
