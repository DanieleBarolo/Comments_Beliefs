Garland's speech yesterday and President Biden labelin' Trump as the undisputed leader of the #January6th attack sounds like a one-two punch kickin' off 2022 as the year of accountability for those who sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

PARENT COMMENT:
* Highest crime rates in decades
* Highest inflation rate in decades
* More Covid cases and deaths than under Trump
* Open border>massive influx of illegal immigrants
* The Afghan debacle
* ETC.

January 20, 2021 did far more harm to America than January 6. This is why Biden needs to deflect from his record and try to focus on the Bad Orange Man.
