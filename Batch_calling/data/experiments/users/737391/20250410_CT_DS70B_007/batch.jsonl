As many have noted, Barack Obama was a once in a generation political genius, but even so, given her huge lead at the beginning and how close it was at the end, Hilary could have won it had not been for the godawful strategic thinking that went into her campaign. I can think of ten HUGE strategic mistakes (seeing things in the short term without even considering the long term) that cost her the nomination and probably the Presidency. Were those her fault? Bill's fault? Penn's fault? In the end, it doesn't matter because if she runs in '16, she and Bill will be front and center. The one people she can replace in '16 is Penn and if she doesn't, it will signal to the world that she doesn't learn well enough from past mistakes.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
