  "article_body": "Several thousand AFL-CIO and SEIU sponsored pro-amnesty demonstrators began rallying on Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon around 12:30 PM to call for Congress to grant legal status to America\u2019s at least 11 million illegal immigrants.The size of the crowd suggest the organization that put on the rally, the Center for Community Change (CCC), under-delivered on its promise to have \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d attend the rally; the group tweeted onMonday afternoonand onTuesday morningthat it expected \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people to attend.Several members of Congress are in attendance at the event, including GOP Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL). Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) is expected to join the event soon as well, an organizer confirmed to Breitbart News.Scores of Democratic House members also began arriving shortly after 12:30 PM on golf carts. House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is scheduled to speak as well, as are many different labor union officials. Washington, D.C. mayor Vince Gray is slated to address the group too.Illegal immigrants and union members have been chanting \u201cSi Se Puede!\u201d the Spanish slogan of the United Farm Workers which President Barack Obama adapted for his \u201cYes we can!\u201d campaign slogan.The event on the National Mall, which is supposed to be closed because of the ongoing government shutdown but to which theObama administrationgranted exception for today\u2019s rally, is heavily funded by organizations like the labor unions and amnesty special interest lobbyists sponsoring it. At least four jumbotrons and an elaborate setup of port-a-potties, special event fencing, tents, and raised and lighted stages are set up across the National Mall.AFL-CIO, SEIU, and Casa De Maryland organizers are walking around in groups, wearing orange vests labeled with their organization\u2019s namesake printed on them.Referencing how union dues from working class American citizens are being used to help fund this rally, a congressional GOP aide told Breitbart News, \u201cIt is utterly shameful that these big money interests have fooled so many they\u2019re trying to hurt into helping them.\u201d If amnesty were to pass, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and many other high-ranking economists expect wages of American workers to be driven down while similarly expecting unemployment to go up.In a statement released as the rally was about to begin, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) said that this is unfair to American workers. \u201cWhy are businesses laying off thousands and then spending a fortune to lobby for \u2018comprehensive immigration reform\u2019?\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThat\u2019s because, in Washington, \u2018comprehensive reform\u2019 means increasing the number of immigrant workers to reduce the cost of labor.\u201d\u201cThe Senate bill would double the number of guest workers and add 30 million mostly lower-skill legal immigrants over the next ten years.\u00a0Today\u2019s rally is designed to pressure the House to pass similar legislation,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere\u2019s something odd about House leaders like Nancy Pelosi protesting on the Mall to get jobs for illegal aliens and pushing legislation to reduce job opportunities for US citizens. The House must resist calls to replace struggling workers and instead fight for the public interest and to restore our shrinking middle class.\u201d",
