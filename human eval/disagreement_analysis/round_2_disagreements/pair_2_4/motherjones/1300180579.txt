Did you know that the Government doesn't write text books?


I'll just chalk that up to your general lack of information on most topics. So far, it includes basic civics, how laws work, and apparently, textbook publishing.

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

PARENT COMMENT:
7th graders? That explains it. It appears that your mind is still in the 7th grade. And yes, you are hostile. What basics of civics and government are you referring to from your 7th grade government written books?

If you want a religious corporation, establish it for your freaking followers only and leave the rest of the world alone.  Religion is not a part of our government and I resent your efforts to impose your warped thinking on your employees, our government and anyone else you attempt to 'convert'.  I stepped into one of your junk stores just once - that was and will be the last time.  My impression as I looked around was thinking of all the underpaid employees handling this junk made by oppressed foreign sweatshop workers.  Your arrogance and attempt to impose some 'standard' on your employees and the U.S. citizens pales next to your support of slave labor for the junk you bring into the market place.  Hobby Lobby doesn't deserve any of our consumer dollars!

Um... no one is actually making you shop or work there. Perhaps <I>you</I> should leave <I>them</I> alone.

    He can't bring himself to just leave it alone since he can't yet seem to deal with his own issues. I wish him well, but to no avail.

Welcome aboard!

        If you guys had the slightest idea what you were talking about, it might not be so hostile.


Consider allamericanwoman. I rest my case.

          LOL, you're hostile because you think I'm wrong. Yeah, that justifies it. :-)

            I'm not particularly hostile, no. But you have demonstrated a considerable inability to grasp even some basic concepts of civics and government. I'd imagine that frustrates some people. 


But I've taught 7th graders, so I have more patience than most.
