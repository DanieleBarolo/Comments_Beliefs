<em>You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.</em>  You're the moron. You do know how insurance works, right? Pool the risks.  You also apparently don't know that the uninsured were still costing the insured people money, lots of money; having them insured actually gives them access to cheaper forms of medical care than going to the ER when, for example, their kid is running a 105ยบ fever.  If they couldn't pay then the costs get passed on to the customers who can, customers like you, Fido70.  Keep up your stupid propaganda, it won't work.

The ACA was the brainchild of Koch-funded, conservative libertarian thinktank The Heritage Foundation.  But it's working  (more people are insured, healthcare inflation has slowed to its lowest pace in decades, <em>etc.</em>and yet the conservative morons still complain.  Progressives want a single payer system, so stop your b-itching.

So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.
