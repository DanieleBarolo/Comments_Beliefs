I believe what I saw & heard of Maxine Waters before, during, after the 92' LA RIOTS & her current Ginning Up of more Violence, surpasses anything "Trump" has said
After all, Maxine caused the invocation of the "INSURRECTION ACT"

            SMH, where did you see in my post where I said it was FAKE NEWS or a HOAX.  Better yet, tell me where you see my saying lets riot.  But ask Rodney King what he thinks about Denny.  Oh wait, he's dead

                  I had to grow up & live through the 92' LA RIOTS. Remember it all.
Maxine Waters District
She went to the "Cinder Block" throwers Daman "Football" Williams  family to help them out after his arrest, when he got out, she gave him a great paying job.  Williams went on to offend.
