  Annotator 2: Response to old ad hominem comment, not clear who against, no issue or stance
  Annotator 4: Also just bickering, maybe (on a good day) could make an educated guess based on full thread, but really cannot do it accurately in any case because I do not have user names (or IDs) for the thread.

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

  What religion is acceptable to you, if any? President Obama sometimes strolls over to St. John's by Layfayette Park. Is that one OK? What about the Rev. Wright's church in Chi - OK?  What about Rev Jackson? Is that OK? How about Al Shrpton - OK?  Islam OK? Are all religious people bigots? What about Dr. Kerwin Lee from Borean Christian Church outside Atlanta - he OK? None of them were OK with Trotsky, not the least bit. How abut you?

    Why should I care, so long as Im not forced to go to the Church, Mosque, synagogue,  or temple? 

Thats the point of the entire argument, its not that HLs owners rights are being infringed(see the fact that they provided contraceptives as part of their healthcare plans for years before this case began), but an attempt to use their religious beliefs as a political weapon.
