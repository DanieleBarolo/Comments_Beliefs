He's not going to win next year if the economy sucks and the public perceives him as ineffectual. He really doesn't have any options left except making the election a referendum on the Republican Party. Fortunately, the Republicans are even more unpopular than Obama so he has some room here to run. \n\nObama needs to do this himself and he needs to do it ASAP. He's wasted almost three years on a political strategy (post-partisan\u00a0 conciliation) that has made him look weak. Republicans, thuggish as they are, haven't really paid a price for their nihilism. For Obama, this is both good politics and good civics. If a major political party doesn't suffer for trying to sabotage the nation, America is not going to survive much longer.

The fact is that income inequality has been rising for 30+ years, the median income has been falling for a decade while corporate profits are setting records, and youth unemployment is through the roof.

Those kind of innovations save the insurance company money, but they aren't really cutting the cost of our nation's health care, they are just shifting the cost around.\n\nFrankly, that's my problem with all of capitalism. The Adam Smith idea that competition and the incentive of profits will force businesses to be more efficient doesn't take into account that businesses can also improve their bottom line by figuring out ways to get others to pay their costs, and ways to cut their own labor costs (by cutting salaries), and ways to legally avoid fulfilling their side of contracts.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHey Steve, I'm not \"advocating\" for anything, especially not what you are suggesting I'm advocating for.\u00a0 I'm stating that under every single projection of government expenditure and revenue Medicare costs go up to unsustainable levels.\u00a0 Do you disagree with that statement of fact?

Generally, the poorer the beneficiaries of the cuts, the more stimulative they are.\nb) Obama realized that the only sort of stimulus he could hope to have passed, given Republican intransigence, would be a tax cut.\nc) So he sought the most stimulative tax cut available given these parameters.\n\nSome tax cuts -- those beloved of Republicans -- are worthless as stimulus, as decades of experience have demonstrated. Some tax cuts -- those Republicans could care less about -- are stimulative, albeit less so than other options which Republicans vehemently oppose.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBut you started the discussion by questioning the need for federal tax increases as part of federal deficit reduction.\u00a0 Then all of a sudden we're talking about how local and state governments spend a lot of money too.\u00a0 \n\nThis conversation slide is why liberals don't believe conservatives when they say they want to reduce the deficit or national debt.\u00a0 It turns out all conservatives care about is reducing the size of government, whether it is federal, state, or local.\u00a0 That is the goal, it would seem, and reducing the debt is just a side benefit.\u00a0 But state and local governments have little to nothing to do with the national debt.\u00a0 It's impossible to move forward on a specific issue when it turns out the other side is not even really interested in that issue.\n\nSo I would ask, is the national debt a problem?\u00a0 If it is, then let's solve it.\u00a0 The most realistic way to solve it, is a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. If conservatives only think the debt is a symptom of having too much government, we're going to get no where, because most of the country disagrees with them, and will in perpetuity unless conservatives somehow convince more people that we should reduce SS and Medicare benefits.\u00a0 Notice conservatives do not get very far when they start advocating that.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

(Which, by the way, includes everything Bob Woodward has written in the last 20 years.) It was obvious <b>at the time</b> that the House Republican freshman weren't going to accept any increase in taxes. They repeatedly publicly came out and said so. Similarly, Obama vigorously stated, on more than one occasion, that he would not allow cuts to entitlement programs if there weren't increased revenues. So irresistible force, meet immovable object. Bai and the WaPo can interview people ad infinitum (each of whom puts their own slant on every picayune detail) and then can cherry pick events and draw lines through them more complicated than a Kennedy conspiracist parsing the Zapruder film in order to reach whatever conclusion they want \u2014 Obama was ready to sell out liberalism!! \u2014 but guess what: <b>There's no there there</b>. A deal was essentially impossible from the beginning unless one or both sides was willing to budge, which they weren't. Being politicians they managed to drag that basic fact out over endless hours of meaningless droning just to make it look like they were operating in good faith \u2014 which is also the goal in all this post-facto spinning to Bai \u2014 but to call it smoke and mirrors is to give it undue praise.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\u00a0You know that what you pedantically call a budget isn't actually necessary to fund the government, right?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Conservatives think the only way Democrats win elections is by tricking \"stupid\"/impressionable/weak minded voters and that Democrats do this tricking by hiding their real views. According to this belief, conservatives are the only ones who know what Democrats and liberals really believe and what their goals really are. \n\nSo that's why even though Democrats and Obama clearly have laid out their policy proposals, we are getting this ridiculous reaction about this quote specifically, and the larger paranoia from conservatives. It doesn't matter what obama says, they've already decided who he is despite all the evidence. \n\nI also love, in the above comment, the pure contempt for voters who disagree with the commenter. Conservatives get mad when Obama says voters revert to cultural issues to decide their vote (\"cling to Gina and religion\") but its ok to call voters stupid and ignorant, as if those were qualities of voters from only one of the two parties and not people generally.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

When it didn't go through the first time, the stock market dropped by over 700 points. The threat of a bank run was real, and could've done very severe damage to the economy.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, look how it passed. The moderates (and leadership) on both side of the aisle voted for it. The far right and far left united in voting against it. That's important. Compromise means some of your own party will vote against it.\n\u00a0\nWhat we have now isn't an emergency. \u00a0Not in the same way. And what we have isn't \"bipartisanship\".\u00a0Instead, we have Democrats pushing ideas as liberal as they can make them. Look at Obamacare. \u00a0The most liberal Democrat members voted for it. Not a single moderate republican voted for it.

You know full well what they are doing is as indefensible as the cops gassing the kids in Berkley. Just admit to what you are seeing, it's okay. Since the Patriot Act, the government, regardless of party is stripping away our freedom. What scares the crap out of me is that I used to count on liberals to be the ones to hold government's feet to the fire, to keep them honest when it comes to personal liberties. Now I cannot even count on that anymore. I disagree with many liberal principles, but personal liberty and freedom was certainly not one of them. What happens Adam when they disagree with what you have to say? More people read your articles than saw that video trailer prior to the violence. \n\nBy the way Adam, the President of Libya says you are full of hogwash on the video causing the violence. That is Whitehouse meme to cover their butts and Egypt and Libya are calling them out on it. The attacks were preplanned acts of terrorism, so please abandon the Carney meme already, it does not suit you. \n\nThis country ran best when we had an executive as president, a man less worried with parties and more worried about leading in Clinton. A generally more conservative Congress to hang on to our money, and a good smattering of liberal judges to keep any conservative agenda from going too far, keeping them on the task of minding our money.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAt what point will the conservatives start dealing in reality? \u00a0The movie may or may not be the exact instigator of the riots and violence, but it took a while for that claim to be investigated and clarified.

American officials, for a variety of reasons, shunned the use of what became known as \"the g-word.\" They felt that using it would have obliged the United States to act, under the terms of the 1948 Genocide Convention. They also believed, understandably, that it would harm U.S. credibility to name the crime and then do nothing to stop it. \n\n<b>At an interagency teleconference in late April, Susan Rice, a rising star on the NSC who worked under Richard Clarke, stunned a few of the officials present when she asked, \"If we use the word 'genocide' and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November [congressional] election?\" </b>Lieutenant Colonel Tony Marley remembers the incredulity of his colleagues at the State Department. \"We could believe that people would wonder that,\" he says, \"but not that they would actually voice it.\" Rice does not recall the incident but concedes, \"If I said it, it was completely inappropriate, as well as irrelevant.\" \n\n\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n\u00a0You keep repeating your version of the story without citing any actual sources.\u00a0 Kevin links to sources that refute your story.\u00a0 Who to believe?\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI do.\u00a0 Everyone does.\u00a0 Read the damn article that *you* linked.\u00a0 The CIA *ALWAYS* goes through this process of (1) raw data, (2) analysis, (3) further confirmation, (4) preliminary findings, and repeat.\u00a0 Raw data is not presented to the President.\u00a0 Raw data are not \"facts\" in the sense that you hope they are.\n\nYou are making endless assumptions and concocting conspiracy theories to make your story work.\u00a0 Give it up.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I think he has such a casual relationship with the truth, he is living in a post-truth world.  Although I kind of think of it as, he isn't even lying because he has no actual beliefs.  He's just as comfortable saying one thing (I'm severely conservative!) as another (I'm a progressive!) because the labels mean nothing to him.

One thing you can always count on this version of republicans to do is distort the truth. None of this happened during the 11 or so attacks on embassies under Bush and it shouldn't have.

None of that shit produces value for their rich handlers (even if in the big picture it keeps their necks out of nooses), because they don't need public health, education, or infrastructure since they don't need any more than they can buy for themselves. This is what \"starving the beast\" was meant to \"achieve\"- running the deficit up and making the rich richer, then punishing the people they despise.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe logic here is just stupefying. \u00a0Let's walk through the so-called \"death panel\" process, so we can see just what the hell you are talking about.\n\n- Terminally ill patient has a few options: (1) choose a path of treatment to extend life for a few months to a few years at great cost or (2) choose a path of treatment that is not likely to extend life but will ease the person into death and cost less.\n- Patient is in a (literally, not Republican rhetoric) government-run health care system. \u00a0Therefore every dollar (or pound rather) spent comes directly from tax payers.\u00a0\n- Choosing path (1) from above means asking the taxpayers to fund, entirely, \u00a0the bill for a few more, likely unenjoyable months or years. \u00a0I, personally, would be ok with this part. \u00a0But it's very surprising that you are. \u00a0Moving on...\n- It seems as if the UK has decided to limit the freely available options for patients to extend life as in path (1). \u00a0I don't know if that is entirely true, but it would seem that way based on that article you posted from the (tabloid) Daily Mail.\n- That said, NOTHING is stopping people from doing your preferred method of healthcare deliver, that is: BUY IT YOUR DAMN SELF. \u00a0\n- Nor would any possible system in the US every PREVENT anyone from buying the care, ANY care, no matter how ridiculous or unlikely to help, on their own with their own money.\n\nSo, just what exactly are you arguing here? \u00a0The UK is cutting back on government spending (just like you argue should happen here in the US), so therefore liberals are wrong? \u00a0I just don't get it.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If he can persuade enough Republicans to take a deep breath and support a compromise measure\u2014and if he can keep the conservative punditocracy from flipping out over it\u2014it has a good chance of passing both Senate and House. If not, probably not.</blockquote>\n\nThat's a lot to ask of Rubio, though, a freshman senator who has no connections to the southwestern segments of the party ready to freak out about any immigration bill. Sure, he's being protected by much of the Republican establishment, but when has that group ever been successful at controlling the base's anger?\u00a0\nPersonally, I doubt Rubio can emerge from the immigration debate unscathed, let alone empowered by a deal. And if he's serious about running for president in 2016, its hard to see how brokering a huge deal with a Democratic president will help him in the primaries. Can Rubio deliver? sure. Will he want to spend any political capital doing so? That's the big question.\u00a0\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n\"\u00a0Democrats best interests that the GOP appear to be hostile to Hispanics.\u00a0\"\n\nThe GOP are, and have nearly always been, hostile to Hispanic minorities (amongst others) - there is no speciousness about this \"reality\".\n\nAre you still having trouble with notions of\u00a0appearance\u00a0and reality?\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nObama isn't going to be running for anything ever again.\n\nMaybe Obama <i>wants</i> immigration reform to happen?\u00a0 In which case, why would it be in his best interests to sabotage immigration reform when there is a chance to pass it.\n\nHas that even crossed your mind?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If the median is half the mean, that means that half of all workers with 401k plans who are nearing retirement had $80K or less in their accounts. That's not nothing but it's also not exactly a retirement plan.\n\nI suppose that if you took that money at 65 and bought a life annuity you might get $6K a \u00a0year. Again, not nothing but it's a pathetically small amount of money compared to the kinds of pensions workers used to receive (and some lucky ones still get).\n\nTo me that's the real takeaway from this chart.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nIn 1900 a white male who lived until age 70 had an average life expectancy of an additional 9 years.

Negotiations have to progress before the real priorities show themselves.\n\nTo criticize Obama now, is to criticize the speed of negotiations*, without recognizing that the Republicans' critique is unfounded (\"Obama has no plan!\").\n\n* And mind you the speed of this process is pretty much exactly on schedule.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Calling Krugman \"shrill\" is like calling a Pomeranian \"Cujo\" (and I think at some level is just an adolescent crack about the fact he has a relatively high voice). In my regular readings of Krugman he's almost never what I would call shrill, meaning he's not over the top, he's not hyperbolic, he's not fantastical, etc. He does indulge in the occasional ad hominem remark, but nothing like what passes for common discourse on talk radio or most of the pundit class (both left and right). Krugman's \"shrillness\" derives from his relentless focusing on the facts and from holding people accountable for the logical consequences of their positions, e.g., \"You predicted hyperinflation, instead it's at record lows. What does that say?\" \"You predicted a credit crisis, but interest rates are near zero.\" etc.\n\nAs I've said many times, the modern day rabid-right has devolved into a cognitive dissonance driven religious cult practicing the art of <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/10/19/when-in-doubt-shout-why-shaking-someones-beliefs-turns-them-into-stronger-advocates/#.UZz9Hiv72z4\">When in Doubt, Shout!</a>. For such folks <b>reality itself is shrill</b>.

They had an \nempirical result that did not shed any evidence whatsoever on the \ndirection of causation. They knew that it shed no evidence whatsoever on\n the direction of causation, because the paper is carefully worded and \nsays that. But instead of following the paper up with subsequent \nresearch that was designed to shed light on the direction of \ncausation, Rogoff in particular started writing op-eds and testifying \nbefore congress and doing high-profile speaking gigs that relied on a \ncausal interpretation of his research that he knew perfectly well was \nnot supported by the research. Academics face a lot of dilemmas when \nthey want to cross the line into the world of policy advice and public \nintellectualism, but these two were not naifs. They were well-known \neconomists involved in policy circles and public debates before \"Growth \nin a Time of Debt\" and they simply chose to skip from the correlation \nfinding to the policy advice without investigating causation in any kind\n of rigorous way first.</blockquote>\n\nIdeally, this would make your work cause for skepticism for the next decade, with everyone double-checking every bit of policy advice you offer to make sure you aren't jumping the gun, and demanding to double-check your data-sets.

Kevin is saying that a piece of legislation that <b>simultaneously</b> provides welfare to a group of financially well off people that don't need it, while cutting funding for a group of people who <b>do</b> need it is class warfare.  \n\n\nIt's specifically the fact that both are happening at once.  So to extend your example, if there was legislation that gave a large tax credit for Teslas (specifically and exclusively, because only rich people buy these, unlike \"hybrids\" as a class) while cutting funding for supplemental bus fare assistance (if there were such a thing), then yes, it would be class warfare.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Before some 1980 and 1981 opinions issued by then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, a failure to fund some part of the government didn't necessarily mean that that part of government would stop functioning. Civiletti's opinions interpreted the Antideficiency Act, a law passed in 1884, as meaning that a failure to pass new spending bills required government functioning to shut down in whole or in part.

For one thing, proton sounds really close to \"photon\" and anyone who has ever watched Star Trek knows that photon torpedos are THE BOMB (a pun on at least three different levels).\n\nSo here's a personal story about the inexorable growth of the \"medical industrial complex.\" In the late sixties my (late and beloved) father was recruited to Seattle to start up an organ transplant program. The UW hospital in those days was an unassuming little red brick building at the corner of Pacific and Montlake. Dad got what was considered an absolutely average office for an Associate Professor, north side, fifth floor, looking out over a small patch of grass. Over the years the place expanded, expanded, and expanded some more, to the point that by the mid-90s the medical complex took up the entire block (making it well over half a mile long) and including a massively expanded dental school, PT school (one of the best in the nation IMO), biochemistry/biophysics divisions, etc. The original red brick building basically disappeared from view, except for a tiny patch visible on the south (Montlake Cut) side if you knew where to look. The view outside dad's office also changed greatly over the years with all the expansions, and at one point in the late 80s he looked down on an underground atrium which provided light to the particle accelerator that was used to generate radioactive isotopes for cancer treatment, an entire massive facility in and of itself which has since been removed. One particularly delicious irony is that when he passed some years ago the jockeying in the department over who would get his office was intense! His once relatively nondescript office was now prime real estate because it was one of the few remaining with a separate space for a secretary (as if the department would pay for THAT anymore) AND an external window.

Nevermind what these so-called \"investors\" are doing.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nYeah yeah yeah... and Lehmann Brothers was a relatively small investment bank, so letting them go under wouldn't cause more than a ripple in the markets. No way it could lead to a Global Thermonuclear Financial Meltdown\u2122, right?\n\nAs lots of smart people have pointed out for decades, financial markets are highly unstable, frequently chaotic systems, particularly in times of high uncertainty. In 2008 Lehmann was a drop in the larger world financial market, but their failure created massive uncertainty via a sequence of \"what ifs?\" that caused short term lending to dry up world-wide. Suddenly the commercial paper window was closed, meaning countless mid- and large-sized companies from Alabama to Zanzibar couldn't make payroll or finance their inventory. That created even more \"what ifs?\" and within a week \u2014\u00a0when our lovely Congress continued their streak of being wrong each and every FU***** time by voting down the bailout \u2014 the markets were in free fall and the US economy was contracting at what was later determined to be a 9% rate, a level of collapse previously considered impossible in a modern economy.\n\nUS Treasury Bills are the bedrock of the world financial system. Neither sexy nor high-paying, but the SINGLE SAFEST investment there is. As Paul Krugman again pointed out the other day, so safe that they frequently carry negative real interest rates, meaning they are considered safer than cash. Up to now the markets have been \"pricing in\" the perception that the GOP wouldn't be crazy enough to jump off this particular financial cliff, but thanks to the lunacy surrounding the CR and Obamacare that \"discount\" is disappearing and yield curves are going to leap. \n\nUnder the best of circumstances world finance is a house of cards held up by trust and optimism. Shake the bottom-most cards \u2014\u00a0or more literally, the table they're stacked on \u2014\u00a0and it will all come tumbling down in days. Hard to say how this plays out, but with each passing day it becomes more likely that the government shutdown and the debt ceiling become intertwined, which might be a good thing from a political point of view, but which create enormous uncertainty \u2014 i.e., panic \u2014\u00a0for the markets.\n\nWe do indeed live in interesting times...\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nNot to worry, according to shooter242 and all the other pro-default folks, we take in way more money than we owe in bond debt service, so we're good.

She's not a good spokesperson at all really, especially for a politician.  I still cringe when I think about her State of the Union response to Bush back in the day (can't remember the year).  Seems like Obama and Co. would have realized that the HHS secretary under Obamacare would need to be someone with enthusiasm and some oratorical skill in order to communicate the program to the public.  \n\n\nBut I tend to agree with First Read.  This kind of thing is a problem because it is more likely to sow seeds of doubt with the younger generation of Obama supporters and loosely-affiliated but lean-toward-Obama people.

The public doesn't like to raise the debt ceiling, because by and large they don't understand it.  So the opposition party has used it in the past to make the politics uncomfortable for the party in power.  Demagogue if you will.  That's what Obama did with Bush, and that's what everyone else did prior.\n\nBut the key difference that you are eliding is no one <b>ever</b> threatened to not pass it.

I don't buy it as somehow more effective than having the voters vote on their Senator, but it sheds some light on the intent, if it's true.

So the responsiveness concept may have been the *intent* of that provision, but a non-existent Senator is fundamentally less responsive than a popularly elected Senator.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And to be a tad more serious, the evidence that we're locked into an extended liquidity trap, with low interest rates, poor avenues for investment, and (most importantly) <em>aggregate demand falling short of aggregate supply</em> is everywhere. It shows in the lack of inflation, in the complaints by people like Bill Gross that even risky investments don't offer a decent return, in the comments by economists as diverse as Krugman/Stiglitz and Summers/Cowan that we're entering a \"new normal\", etc. The best way of raising aggregate demand relative to aggregate supply is to distribute buying power to those who have little or none (either that, or have another event like WWII, which both raised demand AND destroyed a lot of supply, a TWOFER!). \n\nUnfortunately, one of the \"dirty little secrets\" here is that to be really effective it wouldn't be enough to redistribute a little wealth in the US, what's needed is to make the poorer people's of the world, in particular, the <B>median</b> residents of China, India and Africa, a little bit better off. The political chances of that happening are precisely zero  \u2014 tiny changes to our minimally progressive tax code already being the source of more than a few Blanche Dubois fainting spells in Teabagistan\u2122. Eventually purchasing power will almost certainly become more distributed, and aggregate supply will re-align with aggregate demand, but it will likely be years of grinding stagnation and lost potential before that happens. \n\nWelcome to Purgatory!

I dropped Netflix because it never has anything I want to see.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAmong my other \"occupations\" I've followed this space for years, ever since I oversaw implementing video content on the Netscape portal ten years ago(Sigh...  may it rest in peace) so this is a part of the digital media world where I feel pretty confident in my opinions.\n\n\nFirst, it's extremely unlikely that DVDs by mail will go away as there is a proven market for that approach. Even in their original attempt to go \"streaming only\" Netflix tried to start up the parallel Qwikster service (the New Coke of video distribution). So either Netflix will maintain this service or some other company will fill the gap, as there is clearly a significant \"I want to watch X and don't mind waiting a few days\" audience to be served. It's possible the market will shrink enough that it's no longer sensible for the Netflix to have a distribution center within 1-2 days post of every major city in the US, but DVDs by mail is such a beautiful business model \u2014 long tail distribution, high leverage off existing infrastructure, over-subscription producer surplus, low customer management costs, etc. \u2014 I don't see it going away any time soon.\n\n\nNote that DVDs by mail is fundamentally different from the \"local video store\" model which had extremely high fixed costs (both in terms of infrastructure and labor), zero consumer surplus and heavy rent seeking in the form of late fees (fully a third of Blockbuster's revenue at their height).\n\n\nSecond, the availability of content for streaming will continue to improve, albeit in fits and starts, for the foreseeable future. Having seen the way digital distribution roiled both the music and publishing industries \u2014 both deserved it, although for different reasons \u2014 Hollywood and the TV production studios have simultaneously been both more forward looking in their strategy, but more cautious in their implementation. The days when The Wizard of Oz would be shown only once a year, or Disney could re-release it's classic animation features on a rolling 5-8 year schedule, are forever gone (may they NOT rest in peace). \n\n\nThere are still turf wars being waged between the different delivery channels in terms of Hulu vs. Netflix vs. Amazon vs. \"proprietary\" like the networks' own web sites, which limits options. But eventually a classic aggregation-syndication business model will take hold for all but high end or specialized content (viz., the WSJ or New Yorker in the publishing industry) and most will be available through multiple channels. As the technology and bandwidth improve cable will either disappear or, more likely, evolve into a content buffet with a la carte offerings.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMovies?  Or TV shows?  Or both?  I always had the impression Amazon Prime had even more slim pickings, but it could be because I find the interface less easy to browse (i.e., if you know what you are looking for you can find it, but it's not as easy to simply happen upon something you would like to watch).  I have both and feel I don't take advantage of Amazon Prime video enough, so I'd love to hear some tips if you have any!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

So Why Is He So Down On Him?\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nI'm with you on that Woodward review.  He projects his opinion strongly onto Gates' words, focusing on Obama's \"poor leadership\".  Even though, as Kevin points out, Gates has lots and lots of praise for Obama's decisiveness and leadership abilities.  \n\n\nI wonder if Woodward has some kind of withdrawal symptoms about being influential and wants to guide the historical opinion of Obama's presidency, and he thinks the best way to do it is to trash him with this \"poor leadership\" narrative.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nSigh... Gates is practicing the time-honored Washington tradition of burnishing his reputation for history through a self-serving memoir. Nothing wrong with it, as it's almost a universal activity for former administration members of both parties (that and cashing their royalty checks) but reading these particular tea leaves for deep insight into the inner workings of the administration, let alone an accurate backstory on the major policy decisions is going to be a grand excursion in confirmation bias. Hell, to this day my favorite of all these books has to be Paul O'Neill's, \"The Price of Loyalty\" which oh so conveniently affirmed all of my doubts about the Bush/Cheney (aka Chuckles/Vader) regime.\n\nThere is certainly a valid debate/post-mortem to be had on Afghanistan, with the goal being to actually <b>learn something from our errors</b>, but a realistic debate probably needs a better starting point than Gates' trying to thread the needle with intellectual pabulum like, \"Obama made the right decisions but his heart wasn't in them.\" It's just his after-the-fact way of aligning himself with the successes while distancing himself from the failures. Again, nothing new here, so don't give it more weight than it deserves. \n\nPeople look at these things and see what they want to see. Woodward, as Kevin notes, seems to have a particular animus towards the Obama administration \u2014\u00a0likely because they have cut off the \"deep personal sourcing\" he's thrived on for decades \u2014 so he sees a major indictment of Obama's policies. I haven't read the book (and likely won't) but based on Kevin's summaries and a few other reviews see, \"Obama didn't like throwing good money after bad in Afghanistan, but the alternatives were worse\" which pretty much fits my \"If you inherit chicken-shit you can't make it into chicken salad\" view of the situation.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWho needs inner circles when you can get the liars on the outer circles?

You would still have to guess correctly that the same non others last time won't vote this time, and considering there are huge fluctuations in turn out depending on whether it's a presidential/congressional or off year election, you could very very easily accidentally choose a name that votes this time but not last time. And the more fraudulent voters trying to do that, the easier it is to get caught. \n\nAgain, if the more people engaged in fraud, the more likely you can actually influence the election, but also the more likely you would get caught.

But the evidence shows when the jobs dry up, so does the flow of immigrants.  More jobs, more immigrants, and less reason to fear immigrants.\n\n2. Read the article instead of just the headlines: \"Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services churned out by the economy, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.2% in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said. That was less than the third quarter's 4.1% pace, but overall the final six months of the year delivered the strongest second half since 2003, when the economy was thriving.\"\n\n\n\n3. Again, look at the evidence.  Yes, wages are decreased (slightly) in the near term, but not in the long term.\n\n\n4. So are you claiming that 70% of Americans have low-skill jobs?  Then I guess our problem is much bigger than I thought.  I'd like to see some reason to believe that, considering in the following sentences in that article, he states that 87% of Americans have a high school degree and immigrants compete with high school drop outs for jobs.  If it's a problem that immigrants are competing with high school drop outs, then fine, give them tax credits for lost wages or increase funding for parochial schooling, or do something otherwise productive instead of just keeping out willing workers who have willing employers.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Wow.  Folks really really believed in bitcoin, didn't they?  Here's an impressive quote:\n\n\"So, the trillion-dollar question: who took the money? Strictly speaking, we don\u2019t know that yet. We\u2019re talking about a sum of money so large that \u201chumongous\u201d and \u201cenormous\u201d aren\u2019t sufficient to describe it \u2013 it\u2019s 6% of all bitcoin in existence, and assuming bitcoin keeps growing to its potential, that means one individual is sitting on 6% of the world\u2019s future trade and retail currency supply. In today\u2019s USD value, such an amount would be on the order of 20 trillion US dollars, or roughly 250 times the fortune of today\u2019s richest billionaire. It\u2019s not exactly hard to see a motive here.\"\n\nSo, according to Falkvinge, some unknown force just stole 6% of the worlds economy, and he seems to be arguing that he/she/it <i>really possesses a chit to 6% of the worlds economy, because they have 6% of the worlds potential bitcoin.</i>\n\nIn other words, these guys think bitcoin has cornered the market in <u>everything</u>, just because it has.  \n\nGlad I didn't sell all the gold I bought from Glenn Beck just to invest it in Bitcoin.  What clowns.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nTo me, as a non-techie guy who can't see why I need to concern myself with anonymous transactions, that kind of thing sounds like what critics stereotype bitcoin as: a medium for illegal transactions (e.g., Silk Road).  And you're absolutely right that credit cards just have such huge advantages for the consumer.  Advantages that I can't see consumers wanting to give up. Rewards programs, purchase protection, rental car insurance, protection against theft.  Why would a regular person say, \"That's all ok, but I feel bad that my credit card company is charging the merchant a percentage, so I'm going with bitcoin.\"\n\n\nIf the change were to happen to more of a bitcoin dominated system, it would have to come from the merchant, but I can't see that happening, because the \"customer is always right\".\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

But here are the criticisms I see from relatively non-crazy conservatives regarding Obama's actions:\n\n\nMcArdle (and others) says Obama is afraid to \"inflict pain\" via legislation, so he delays requirements that are \"integral to the making the law work\".  How thoughtful of them, showing concern that the law might not work!  But if that is the crime Obama is committing, aren't the anti-Obamacare folks--those same folks who gleefully predicted the collapse of Obamacare under its own weight--happy that Obama is contributing to the demise his signature legislative win?  \n\n\n\nMy point above is: Ok, we get it, you hope Obama fails no matter what he does, but it doesn't mean we (or he) have to respond to every criticism that comes out of your mouth.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

The intent of the ACA was to put in place a health insurance system where anyone and everyone is guaranteed a chance to buy it--i.e., universal health care with a privatized health insurance system.  The secondary intent was to \"bend the cost curve\" meaning make the <b>rate of increase</b> in health care costs slow.  The \"affordable\" in \"Affordable Care Act\" was merely a positive word to throw in the name of a bill.  Yes, you got it: all bills are given propaganda names.  \n\n\nIf you are referring to the 2008 campaign promise from candidate Obama about saving (up to) $2,500 per family per year, that was not as a result of a universal health care plan, but for transitioning to electronic medical records, and yes it was beyond an embellishment.\n\n\nBut \"making health care more affordable\" means, more than anything, paying doctors and hospitals less.  Simple as that.  Find a way to pass that bill and I'll devote my life to making you President.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

That's pretty much it. Republicans otherwise deny any kind of complexity that makes a bummer out of the economic free-for-all that is holy writ for their tribe. Call them know nothings, call them stupid, they know what is in their immediate self-interest, and it's not far-off threats (read: a decade or more) or externalized costs. Who cares? Life is meant to be prosperous and the rest can go fuck itself.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYeah, it was like \"a broken clock is right twice a day\" but then all subsequent (and previous for that matter) explanations were like a guy setting his watch to another wrong time right before it matches with the correct time.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

We know.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLet me expound on what I mean by City incompetence:\n\n\nFrom the get-go, they wanted to play both sides of the fence.  On one hand, let the Occupiers camp out in Frank Ogawa Plaza, on the other didn't want them to stay.  So they let the issue linger and eventually and abruptly decide to oust the protesters.  Honestly, the best way to handle that would have been to just let the campers stay as long as they want, after already allowing them to set up camp.  This way of responding to the protest just set up a future conflict.  Either don't allow the camping at all in the beginning, or just let it fizzle out.  The \"oh shit look at all these people we gotta kick 'em out right?\" way of responding set up a contentious situation.  Not to mention that there was the lingering resentment from the Oscar Grant shooting and related protests.  There was history, and the City was scared to do unpopular things and also scared to do nothing.\n\n\nThen when the protest/marchers began, they would allow the protesters free reign to go where the wanted and/or set garbage bins on fire in the middle of the street and let it escalate.  Responsible leadership would direct the officers to stop the violence as it is growing, not let the crowds and anger grow. The later protests, including the Whole Foods incident, there didn't seem to be any police presence at all, I still don't know the story behind that.\n\n\nAs for your view of police, all I can say is, yes there are asshole cops, violent cops, and yes, the occupation of police officer seems to select for assholes, and in addition, Oakland seems to have a preponderance of cops who don't seem to care about the residents as much as they should, probably because of the preponderance of cops who don't even live in Oakland.  I heard the statistic that Oakland cops have the least percentage of employees that live in the City of all or close to all police departments in the Bay Area.  That doesn't help.  \n\n\nBut regardless of all that, where I'm coming from is this: Kevin wondered why tea party marches/protests/etc. don't generally involve crack downs by police like leftist protests do and I think the evidence is pretty strong that at least part of it is that leftist protesters want the conflict and some even intentionally provoke the police.  Not *all* of the leftist protesters, but they are there.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

According to his story there was a \"peaceful\" demonstration outside to consulate against the video. Then these demonstrators were fired upon by the consulate security. Enraged they attacked. He just helped direct traffic outside. This is just a cover story and largely bogus but it's what he has claimed to date.\n\nSecondly, I actually watched the live news coverage of the aftermath of the attack. I think it was France 24 or something who broadcast a interview with a local Libyan at the scene who said \"this was because of the video\" (paraphrased).

Isn't that an oxymoron?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nOh for the love of god, when somebody says \"inflation is at 1.6 percent\" they aren't saying that volatility in food prices is a-ok.  Inflation is a specific measure of the slippage between the money supply and aggregate demand.  It gives you a sense of what, if any, macroeconomic tools should be brought to bear on the system.  \n\nIssues with energy prices being up or down, or with income disparity, or with the affordability of basic household goods, are not measured by looking at the inflation rate--they have their own separate metrics and indicators.  And they are important.  But complaining that the metric for inflation doesn't also also provide \"relei[f]\" for \"those folks out there struggling with meager budgets\" is like complaining that your odometer doesn't tell you enough about your oil pressure.  It's dumb. \n\nAs is the anti-intellectual foolishness about \"economic gurus\" being best relegated to garbage trucks.  Frankly, it's been said gurus that have been pushing for measures that have ameliorated the recession (stabilization funding, stimulus, expanding the fed's balance sheet), while populist idiots (primarily, although sadly not exclusively on the right) have been pushing a lot of destructive nonsense about belt-tightening and austerity, all in the name of some phantom inflation that hasn't troubled us for close to 30 years.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"I've never heard anybody claim that ZeroHedge is not reliable. \"\n\n\nThen you need to listen to more people.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I've said it before and will say it again, we spend TWICE as much as any other nation on our health care without any evidence of better outcomes, indeed on a lot of scales we're worse than other countries. It's patently arguable that 8-10% of our GDP is a <strong>dead weight loss</strong>. \n\nIs Obamacare good policy? Meh. Doesn't go nearly far enough in terms of reining in big pharma, a public option, Medicare eligibility at 55, etc. etc. But when you had a system as rotten as ours had become, with rent seeking and waste as far as the eye could see, it's easy to make improvements. His poll numbers may not be that impressive right now, but Big O is going to look pretty damn good when the history books get written. \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThank you.

Talk about a hack.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nTo put it in perspective, consider Rod Blagojevich.  Among the many well-supported charges of corruption, there was the matter of filling the senate seat that had then recently been vacated by President Obama.\n\n\nA Blagojevich defender might argue that the governor has the sole power to make that appointment, and that it's entirely proper for him to consider his political benefit when doing so. He could appoint a friend. He could appoint himself. He could trade the appointment for support for one of his legislative priorities.\n\nBut there's a clear line between using the powers of his office for his political benefit and using them for his personal financial benefit, or for that of his family. He committed a crime when he tried to trade the senate seat for campaign cash, or for a sinecure for him and/or his wife.\n\n\nSo, to Perry. He can use his line item veto to advance his political agenda. He can use it to punish enemies and reward allies.  If he wants to use his line-item veto to wipe out departments under Democratic control, he can do that, and he's accountable only to the voters of his state.\n\n\nWhere he may have crossed the line, though, is in shutting down a unit that was looking into corruption among some of his friends/family.

The larger the tax, the bigger the effect. A tax is just one tool, another being public awareness campaigns a la anti-smoking.  The less bad stuff you have to say about an action, objectively the less bad it is, so the less reason you have to discourage it's use. \n\nJust to wrap this back to the beginning, I responded to your comment that implied any tax at all on weed is bad, a sentiment akin to \"there those liberals go again with their taxing stuff\". I vehemently disagree that any tax at all is bad.
