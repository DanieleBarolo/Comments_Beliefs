If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

Fun fact - 85% of all domestic violence victims are women. Incidents of domestic violence are 12 times more likely to end in murder when guns are present in the household. Let's all pretend that guns make women safer, though.

  Please display the 12x evidence, I have found none to support that claim.

      Thanks for that. Then the obvious area to address is Domestic Violence, not gun owners in general.

        If the increased risks associated with gun ownership were limited to those described in that study, I would agree.

          The benefit of gun ownership and self defensive use is harder to compare to harm caused by criminals as self defense is not counted or recorded in police reports and there are not check boxes for "did the victim defend with a gun" on police reports. Perhaps if they were we would have the other side of the story. As it stands now all we have are surveys that place these events at between 500,000 and 3,000,000, most likely a mid number of 1,500,000. These figures should be compared for a more accurate description of our current reality.
Personal self defense is the primary reason for women being the fastest growing segment of gun owners. 
Improved victim call lines, women's shelters and support services, and improved police response times are the avenues to directly address these events.

            “As it stands now all we have are surveys that place these events at between 500,000 and 3,000,000, most likely a mid number of 1,500,000.”

The numbers that rely on phone surveys are complete garbage.  In some crime categories, firearms would have to be used defensively in more than 100% of crimes in order for those numbers to be accurate.

There are about 1.1 million violent crimes reported in this country ever year – and we’re expected to believe that there are 1.5 million defensive uses of firearms?  When only about 40% of households <i>even own a gun?</i>

              Kind of ironic that you decry surveys for DGUs, and bring up "40% of households", which is itself based on a survey. We know DGUs happen, however putting an objective number on them is next to impossible, and by the same token we have no idea how many people own firearms or where they are, because the surveys depend on self-reporting, you might bear that in mind before you invoke phone surveys yourself, just a suggestion.

                It doesn’t matter.  Even if we assume 100% of households own guns, the numbers still don’t work.

According to the Kleck and Getz survey, guns were used in self-defense during 845,000 home burglaries – but there are less than 500,000 burglaries in this country every year in which the occupants of the home are both at home and awake.
