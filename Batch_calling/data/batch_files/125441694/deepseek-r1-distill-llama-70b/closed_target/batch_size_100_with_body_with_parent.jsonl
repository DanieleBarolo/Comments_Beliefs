Some have resorted to doing their business on theflooror outdoors, others have used showers, and many migrants\u00a0will have never seen toilet paper before.The issue caused some serious confusion last year, with one small German village beingaccused of racismafter issuing leaflets politely asking migrants to use to the correct facilities.With 1.5 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa arriving in the country last year, solving the problem without facing such accusations of bigotry presents a sizeable business opportunity.Enter the Global Fliegenschmidt toilet manufacturers based in Coswig, Saxony-Anhalt, who have announced their plans to develop a mobile \u201cmulticultural toilet\u201d complete with a squatting platform and water hose for migrant\u00a0friendly sanitation.The design was shown\u00a0to theFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungnational newspaper, who gave a gloriously politically correctwrite upof the new product, branding it, \u201cUniversally applicable: the refugee toilet is ideal for the globalised defecation.\u201d\u201cBecause everyone knows: Different cultures also mean different scale latrines. For Muslims, it is important that when using a toilet, one\u2019s back does not face Mecca. In addition, latrines for men and women have to separate from each other, and the floor cannot be green in colour, because that is the colour of Islam\u201d, reads their report.The article describes refugees standing on toilet bowls and breaking them, and some who resort to defecating in bushes.\u201cGerman toilets are a mystery to many refugees and this has already led to problems. A new mobile multicultural toilet should remedy this\u2014and along the way teach something about the coexistence of cultures\u201d, declares the article.In concludes: \u201cAnd so, as the refugees have brought about many changes in German society solely by their presence\u2026 so is it now with the toilet in the future with this pressing issue.\u201cWith some justification, one could say: Here we can even learn something from the refugees.\u201d\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nStop feeding them.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The terrorists\u00a0surfaced from the forests in which they were hiding \u201cbegging for food,\u201d one witness stated, having chosen surrender over starvation.The surrender occurred in the town of Gwoza, previously the scene of a Boko Haram massacre,the Associated Press reports. The men leading the group, which included women and child hostages, demanded to be fed in exchange for surrender, according to both a Nigerian soldier who could not be named and a civilian self-defense group representative. The Boko Haram terrorists allegedly told soldiers that there were many like themselves hiding in Borno state\u2019s Sambisa forest, home base for the Islamic State-affiliated terror organization, hoping to surrender in exchange for being fed.Nigerian news outlet Naijpublished a photothey claim is of the surrendering group.The mass surrender follows a similar incident in which Nigerian soldiers arrested a number of high-ranking Boko Haram members who appeared to be attempting to travel south, out of the typical range of action for the terrorist group. On Monday, the Civilian Joint Task Force assigned to assist the military in attacking Boko Haram in areas that are less accessible to the federal governmentannounced that they had arrestedfour suspected Boko Haram members in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno. \u201cThe suspects looked unkempt with signs of starvation and have been handed over to the military for further interrogation,\u201d according to Nigeria\u2019sDaily Post.All four were members of Nigeria\u2019stop 100 most wanted terrorist list, and were identified through tattoos they bore of Boko Haram symbols.The next day, Nigerian military spokesmen announced that four men had been arrested in relation to a church bombing near the capital, Abuja, conducted five years ago. The bombing has been attributed to the Boko Haram group and the men are believed to be members. One man, identified as Victor Moses,was arrestedafter lurking around a local mosque, claiming he was a Christian looking to convert. Authorities believe Moses was conducting surveillance to give Boko Haram jihadists the information necessary to bomb the mosque. Moses has confessed to this crime.The Associated Press notes that the Nigerian military is taking these arrests as evidence that their tactics against Boko Haram are working, particularly their attempts to cordon off the Sambisa forest and prevent those hiding within from acquiring food, fuel, or weapons. \u201cIn essence, the insurgents have been effectively denied territory or sanctuary and are now in disarray\u2026 Scattered, demoralized and hungry, they have resorted to terror tactics available to a degraded and defeated insurgent group,\u201d Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s Information Minister, said in February.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has already declared victory against Boko Haram, despite their continued ability to stage suicide bombings and village raids. \u201cTechnically, we have won the war,\u201d Buharisaid in Decemberin a BBC Hausa interview.\u00a0\u201cBoko Haram has been systematically decimated and are in no position to cause serious threat to our development programmes,\u201d hereiterated last monthat a meeting with the Emir of Qatar. Many doubt Buhari\u2019s confidence, however, as Boko Haram has staged numerous attacks between December and March, including the massacre of dozens in the village of Dalori, Borno.Nigeria has become an increasingly inhospitable country for its Christians,according to a report released in February. Up to 11,500 Christians have been killed and more than one million displaced in the past 16 years, and 13,000 churches have been destroyed.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nServe them pork chops.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Bought Teen Girl Sex From her Guatemala Family\n\n# News comment article:\nAn illegal alien in North Carolina has been charged with several crimes after he bought a 14-year-old Guatemalan girl as a sex slave, according to police.Guatemalan Pasqual Mendez, 23, purchased the girl from her family members and paid for her travel expenses as part of the trafficking deal, according toThe News Herald.The Morganton Department of Public Safety determined that while the girl was a \u201clegal resident\u201d of the U.S., theyfoundno evidence that Mendez was in the country legally and he may face deportation if convicted. His charges include felony human trafficking of a child and statutory rape.Local residents were appalled when they found out a sex slave lived in their neighborhood, but Mendez\u2019s family approved of\u00a0the arrangement.The victim\u2019s cousinexplainedto a local news outlet in Spanish that the victim, brought to the U.S. six weeks ago, was there to work.\u00a0\u201cShe can clean up and do stuff. And also sweep and mop,\u201d the cousin\u2019s daughter translated.\u201cIt is disgusting that the United States let that happen, to be honest with you,\u201d an American-born neighbor told the TV station. \u201cWhat did [Mendez] go through to make this happen?\u201dWhile police aren\u2019t releasing the exact amount Mendez paid for the girl, Mendez\u2019s family said he bought the\u00a014-year-old for thousands of dollars and planned to marry her.Guatemala raised the legal age at which girls can be married from 14 to 18 in 2015, but implementing the change demands a massive\u201ccultural shift\u201dthat\u2019s slow to take hold in the Third World country. And child sex trafficking isrampantin Guatemala:Every day 33 people become entrapped in sex trafficking rings in Guatemala, including a \u201cshocking\u201d proportion of children, some of them sold into the sex trade by their mothers, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said.Nearly 60 percent of the 50,000 victims of sex trafficking in Guatemala are children, according to a report by UNICEF and the U.N. Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which estimates the industry to be worth $1.6 billion a year.\u201cWe never imagined the magnitude of the number of children being sexually exploited. People were shocked by the figures, as were we,\u201d Mariko Kagoshima said, referring to the recent U.N. report.Girls as young as 12 work in brothels and are forced to have sex with up to 30 customers a day, while virgin girls are recruited at schools, she said.Sex trafficking is fueled by a \u201csocial tolerance\u201d of children being sold for sex work, a business equal to 2.7 percent of Guatemala\u2019s gross domestic product, she said.Local news headlines describe the illegal alien enslaver\u00a0as a \u201cman,\u201d leaving the public in the dark about how a lack of immigration enforcement affects their communities, and ignoring\u00a0the fact that criminal aliens live\u00a0amongst them in violation of their consent.Mendez was charged June 30 and is held on a$1 million secured bond.As many as 11 to 30 million illegal aliens remain on U.S. territory.H/T:Illegal Alien Crime Report\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHe must have missed the assimilation memo.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Campaigners toured from the University College London down to Parliament blasting Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u2018Born in the USA\u2019 while chanting \u201cDon\u2019t Vote Trump\u201d from an open top bus.While illegal for registered U.S. charities to work with or for presidential candidates, a spokeswoman for Avaaz denied any connection to the Hillary campaign when\u00a0quizzed. Campaigners with Avaaz however, were recorded shouting, \u201cVote for Hillary!\u201d during the demonstration.A huge 88 per cent of Americans living abroad did not register to vote in the last presidential election, and Avaaz points out that \u201cthis massive untapped voting block\u201d is much more likely to be \u201cprogressive\u201d because \u201c56\u00a0per cent of us [in the UK] have masters degrees\u201d and overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates in the last three presidential primaries.In a press release, Avaaz references a newOxford University studythat found \u201cAmerica\u2019s overseas voters\u2026 could decide the US presidency in 2016\u201d. When combined, the potential 8 million voters around the world, \u201cwould make up the 13thlargest state\u201d, they say.Just 12 per cent of Americans abroad were registered to vote in 2012, and \u201cthe reason they don\u2019t vote is that it\u2019s a complicated process for them to register from abroad and many Americans miss the deadline\u201d, Meredith Alexander, the Campaigns Director for Avaaz, told Breitbart London.Her charity, which has also campaigned for \u201crefugee rights\u201d and against Brexit, claims to have \u201cenlisted over 30 million people around the world to share\u201d a new \u201csuper easy\u201d tool enabling left wing American expats to register to vote quicklyen mass.\u201cAvaaz has created the world\u2019s first, global, citizen\u2019s get-out-the-vote drive\u201d,\u00a0Ms. Alexander added. \u201cThe more people that share it on Facebook, the more Americans abroad will see it, and the more we will be able to stop the global threat of Trump\u201d.The group chose London for the launch as the UK has the \u201clargest concentration of US expats outside of North America\u201d, and at the event several Americans registered to vote before the media to prove how easy it is with Avaaz\u2019s new tool.\u201cFor months, the world has sat on the sidelines, horrified by Trump\u2019s hate. Now, global citizens have a way to fight back\u201d, Emma Ruby-Sachs, Deputy Director of Avaaz added.The charity\u2019s website encourages people to email potential U.S. voters in other countries, giving them a\u00a0template that reads:\u201c8 million Americans abroad could defeat Trump\u2026 if they vote! I wanted to make sure you saw this new overseas registration tool that makes voting dead-easy. It literally takes a few minutes :)\u201d.The official campaign makes no mention of other presidential candidates, and is framed as simply anti-Trump. Banners on the bus today insisted the campaign it is \u201cnot authorised by any candidate or candidate office\u201d and linked to Avaaz.org/VoteAbroad, an unintentionally close sound to \u2018Voter Fraud\u2019 \u2013 an issue which campaigners will be keen to avoid discussion of.\u201cWe are a charity in the United States, we are governed by American law, and we are not allowed to coordinate with any candidate\u201d, Ms. Alexander explained to Breitbart London.\u201cBut, we are absolutely allowed to advocate for our position,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd our position is that Trump is a global threat\u201d.Her argument was that Avaaz was not working for Hillary, which would be illegal, but was instead dedicated to issues like climate change and opposing nuclear weapons, and therefore must oppose Mr. Trump and his policies, which implicitly means backing Hillary.\u201cWhether it\u2019s banning Muslims or building walls, the man sows division wherever he goes, and that\u2019s part of the reason Avaaz wanted to make sure everyone, everywhere can help stop Trump\u201d, Ms. Alexander added.Avaaz launched in 2007 to agitate for various left-wing causes including animal rights and mass migration. They organisedthe biggestclimate change march in the UK\u2019s history and theGuardianhasdescribedthem as \u201cthe globe\u2019s largest and most powerful online activist network\u201d.They claim\u00a0to be \u201cindependent and accountable\u201d and \u201cwholly member-funded\u201d. Yet, they were formed by the merger of several establishment groups includingMoveOn.org\u2013 a group that received $1.46 million from George Soros during the 2004 election cycle \u2013 and Res Publica, which has received grants totalling $250,000 from the liberal billionaire\u2019s Open Society group.Furthermore, Avaaz co-founder Ricken Patel\u00a0has worked for \u2013 either directly or as a consultant \u2013 numerous globalist foundations and corporations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Gates Foundation.According to POLITICO, Mr. Soros hascommittedaround $25 million to assisting Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party causes at this election cycle.Avaaz also campaigned against the UK leaving the European Union under the banner: \u201cChoose Love, Vote Remain\u201d.Meredith Alexander said, \u201cAvaaz is just as strongly in support of trying to stop Brexit as we are of trying to stop Trump\u201d and that it is \u201cpart of the same challenge\u201d of suppressing populist, anti-globalist movements.\u201cYou have forces of division that are rising in a number of countries, whether it\u2019s here with Brexit\u2026 the Austrian presidential election, or the American presidential election.

While Judge Sotomayor exemplifies the American Dream, she would not have even been on the short list if she were not Hispanic.\u201dShapiro noted that \u201cin over 10 years on the Second Circuit, she has not issued any important decisions or made a name for herself as a legal scholar or particularly respected jurist.\u201dIn picking a case to highlight during his introduction of the nominee, Shapiro wrote, \u201cPresident Obama had to go back to her days as a trial judge and a technical ruling that ended the 1994-95 baseball strike.\u201dCritics of Sotomayor, however, were not confined to the Right but spanned the gamut all the way to the far Left.In aletterto President Barack Obama in 2009, his former Harvard law professor and mentor Laurence Tribe tried to convince the President not to appoint Sotomayor, saying that despite her \u201cdemographic appeal\u201d she was not qualified for the job and would stir dissension among the justices.Although he acknowledged his intent to move the court in a \u201cpragmatically progressive direction,\u201d Tribe counseled the President to steer clear of Sotomayor.\u201cIf you were to appoint someone like Sonia Sotomayor,\u201d Tribe wrote, \u201cwhose personal history and demographic appeal you don\u2019t need me to underscore, I am concerned that the impact within the court would be negative in these respects.\u201d\u201cBluntly put, she\u2019s not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is, and her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the Court,\u201d he said.According to Slate, during Court arguments, Sotomayor often watched Scalia with \u201ca leery gaze,\u201d as though she were dreading the next statement to leave his mouth. When he spoke, \u201cSotomayor remained frozen in a steely stare,\u201d the article states.Which probably explains why she would have liked to beat him with a baseball bat, had she had the chance.Follow Thomas D.

Instead of the customary media conference call, this one turn into a heated political debate.Things grew testy between Kaepernick and a particular media member of Cuban descent, in regards to Kaepernick\u2019s past wearing of a Fidel Castro t-shirt. Accordingto thePalm Beach Post, \u201cWhen pressed about the shirt, Kaepernick first pointed out that Malcolm X also was pictured. Kaepernick said he supports Malcolm X and his willingness to be \u201copen-minded\u201d before forming his own views of the world. Part of that open-mindedness, he said, was meeting with the Cuban leader.\u201dTheMiami Heraldreporter pressed Kaepernick about Castro, prompting Kaepernick to say, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about Fidel Castro and his oppression. I\u2019m talking about Malcolm X and what he\u2019s done for people.\u201dThe reporter confronted Kaepernick after the quarterback steered the conversation away from the \u201cuncomfortable\u201d topic of Castro. Kaepernick shot back, \u201cOne thing that Fidel Castro did do is they have the highest literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here, even though we\u2019re fully capable of doing that.\u201dWhen the reporter challenged Kaepernick on Castro\u2019s history of breaking up families, Kaepernick responded, \u201cWe do break up families here. That\u2019s what mass incarceration is. That was the foundation of slavery so our country has been based on that as well as the genocide of native Americans.\u201dAfter the South Florida media cited aSports Illustratedstudy which said that many fans stopped watching the NFL because of Kaepernick\u2019s anthem protests, he responded by blaming the fans:\u201cThey\u2019re not watching football because of my stance about fighting systematic oppression and wanting the same equality and freedom for all people.\u201cI would say they probably need to look in the mirror at what they value. You know, if they\u2019re OK with people being treated unfairly, being abused, being harassed, being terrorized, then the problem is more with what they\u2019re doing in their lives than it is about watching football games.\u201dEven as the NFL remains perfectly unwilling to stop Kaepernick\u2019s anthem protest, by insulting huge swaths of the NFL\u2019s fan base and suggesting that disagreeing with his protest somehow makes them okay with the harassing and terrorizing of innocent people Kaepernick\u2019s conduct on this phone call crosses a line that\u2019s not protected by free speech, or any right to protest.The NFL has a recent precedent of cracking down on players whom they believe engage in conduct insulting or offensive to people at large, or certain groups in particular. In fact, the NFL exercised that power in Miami when theysuspended and finedthen-Dolphins safety Don Jones for tweeting \u201cOMG\u201d and \u201chorrible\u201d after Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on live television during the 2014 NFL Draft.If the NFL can use that kind of disciplinary action against a player for, in their opinion, offending the relatively small gay community then they can certainly exercise that same discipline against Kaepernick for his insanely-offensive rant against far larger segments of their fan base.Again, there\u2019s no reason to believe the league will do that. But they could.Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter:@themightygwinn\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nFool.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Seth Moulton (D-MA) said if members of the Trump campaign or administration have been \u201cconspiring\u201d with Russia, they have committed \u201ctreason.\u201dPartial transcript as follows:MOULTON: The bigger problem, the scandal of the century, not the scandal of the week, is this ongoing relationship with Russia. There is no question, it\u2019s the unequivocal conclusion of all our intelligence agencies that Russia wanted Donald Trump to be elected president. Either that\u2019s just because they think Trump is Putin\u2019s buddy and he is going to do his bidding, or because they have material they can use against the administration. We don\u2019t need to just know what Flynn knew or what his associates in the White House knew. We need to know what Russia knows and what they still hold over the heads of the people in the White House.BLITZER: Do you think Flynn acted alone when he made that phone call to the Russian ambassador in Washington?MOULTON: I don\u2019t think that anything in Washington happens alone. Certainly not a call with the ambassador to our number one enemy for the last 65 years. I mean, let\u2019s not lose perspective on exactly who we\u2019re talking about here. Russia is the number one enemy of the United States of America. If members of the administration are essentially conspiring with Russia, either through the campaign earlier or now in the administration itself, look, that\u2019s the definition of treason. This is a very, very serious affair. While we need to understand what\u2019s going on with Michael Flynn, but we can\u2019t let this little scandal, or perhaps a big scandal at the moment, let us lose sight of the much bigger scandal, which is what is the overall connection between Russia and the Trump administration?BLITZER: Let me be precise on this. You\u2019re throwing out a huge word, treason. Explain exactly what your concern is.MOULTON: The definition of treason is putting the interests of our enemy ahead of our own. That\u2019s what the definition is. It seems like there\u2019s a lot of evidence that there are members of the administration who are more concerned aboutRussia\u2019s goals than our own. They continually prioritize the desires of the Kremlin, like, for example, rescinding the sanctions that have been so importantly been put in place, and it\u2019s just the voice of the administration that\u2019s doing this. You hear both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill saying that this makes no sense. It makes no sense to pull back sanctions against our enemy. So why is it that the administration wants to do that?BLITZER: It\u2019s not the whole administration. Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., speaking before the Security Council on Crimea, she was very tough on the Russians. General Mattis, in his confirmations, very tough on the Russians. Other officials, Rex Tillerson, even though he had business dealings with the Russians, received an award from Putin, very tough in his comments on the Russians. It\u2019s not the administration as a whole.MOULTON: Well, absolutely it is because it starts at the top. That doesn\u2019t mean that everybody is implicated, but this is exactly what we need to figure out. I\u00a0 don\u2019t think that Michael Flynn is going to be the only person to fall here. I find it very hard to believe that in an administration that has continually drawn the line, as Jim Acosta said, against criticizing Russia, has continually favored Russian interests very publically, it\u2019s hard to believe that there\u2019s just one fall guy here. I think in a lot of ways that\u2019s what the Trump administration is hoping, that this scandal with Flynn will distract from the larger issue, which is what will distract attention from\u2014did Russia want to influence our election?

I am the first female comic who is selling out arenas all over the world and so grateful for that. I am embarrassed for the \"journalists\" who report on trolls activities as if it's news. It's indicative of administration right now. Anyone who reported that \"viewers aren't happy\" with my special, it would have been cool if you did a moment of research before posting. The alt right organized trolls attack everything I do. Read the @splitsider article. They organize to get my ratings down. Meeting in sub Reddit rooms. They tried on my book and movies and tv show And I want to thank them. It makes me feel so powerful and dangerous and brave. It reminds me what I'm saying is effective and bring more interest to my work and their obsession with me keeps me going. I am only alarmed by the people printing their organized trolling as \"news\" this is what the current administration wants. So this post has nothing against the trolls. I thank you trolls so much. It fills me with hope and power to see you all furiously posting so as always accuse me of whatever lies you want. Call me a whale. Call me a thief and I will continue to rise and fight and lead. I know who I am. I am strong and beautiful and will use my voice my whole time on this earth. Journalists do better it's embarrassing.

The jihadists interrupted the police operation and then began attacking authorities and positioning themselves to turn Marawi into an Islamic city, raising the ISIS flags over mosques and killing anyone identified as Christian.Survivors have reported that the terrorists arestopping civiliansattempting to flee and forcing them to recite Islamic prayers. Those who cannot recite them are killed immediately, even those who identify as Muslim. Police found a pile of bodies this week labeled \u201chypocrites,\u201d which they believe to be Muslims that the jihadists found insufficiently devout. Islamic State supporters around the world have used this tactic when attempting to establish an Islamic stronghold.President Rodrigo Duterte implemented a 60-day martial law status over Mindanao last week in response to the raid, telling soldiers to \u201cspare no one\u201d and giving them the ability to arrest individuals and search homes without warrants. During his announcement of the martial law rule, he warned soldiers not to violate human rights norms, though he later joked that he would protect them if they raped up to three women while on the job.While both Maute and Abu Sayyaf are indigenous terrorist groups, Philippine policehave identifiedMalaysian and Indonesian terrorists among the criminals, with one official describing the battle for Marawi as an \u201cinvasion.\u201dPhilippine police say the objective of the Maute terrorists in Marawi appears to be to legitimize themselves as heads of a true Islamic State \u201cwilayat,\u201d or province.\u00a0\u201cThey wanted to show the world that there is an ISIS branch here which can inflict the kind of violence that has been seen in Syria and Iraq,\u201d military chief of staff Gen. Eduardo A\u00f1otold reporters. Islamic State caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not issued a personal statement accepting Maute and Abu Sayyaf as Islamic State members, though reports place him in Mosul, Iraq \u2013 ground zero of the global coalition\u2019s war on the terrorist group.A\u00f1otold reportersthat, while violence in Marawi continues to rage, authorities believe that 70 percent of the city is free of jihadist control. Authorities place the death count so far at over one hundred, including 65 jihadists and 15 Philippine soldiers. At least two mass graves of civilians have surfaced.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3332738623\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHis military is incapable of accomplishing his goals.  \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

America has lost,\u201d proclaimed Duterte in October 2016.\u201cYou know, if China and Russia would decide to create anew order, I would be the first to join,\u201d he stressed in November.However, the Philippines president has apparently changed his mind.Duterte indicated this month that he plans torespectthe Philippines\u2019 military agreement with the United States, which prohibits Manila from forging military alliances with any other country.Moreover, the Philippines leader vowed to \u201cgive all\u201d to support President Donald Trump.\u201cI am okay with President Trump and\u00a0I can assure him also of our friendship and cooperation,\u201d he said in March.\u201cBut for the previous president, I was an evil man,\u201d added Duterte. \u201cThat crazy man was planning to jail me. This other one [Trump], he said, \u2018you\u2019re right.\u2019\u201dTrump hasreportedlyexpressed support for Duterte\u2019s deadly anti-drug campaign, a claim that has not been confirmed by the U.S. administration.The Philippines\u2019 efforts against the illegal use of drugs has resulted in the extra-judicial killings of thousands.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3251617194\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYou make the mistake of applying your morals to people who struggle daily.

Across the shirt\u2019s front is a crude drawing of a green-clad soldier armed with an automatic weapon and standing smiling, as a yellow dog seems to be attacking a bearded man wearing a turban and dropping his own weapon. The turbaned figure has x\u2019s for eyes, in the cartoon convention for death. Underneath the drawing is the phrase \u201cLife is great.\u201dThe photo brought mixed reactions, but many criticized the coach for his shirt.On one hand, theBoston HeraldcalledBelichick a \u201ctrue patriot,\u201d but Vice Sportscalledthe shirt \u201coffensive.\u201dThe shirt came from Trident K9, a company that sells police and military equipment for K9 units.\u201cIf you are a military K-9 handler, then life is great! Celebrate the end of Osama Bin Laden with this T-shirt,\u201d the store website reads on its page selling the shirt.Jim Amann, the president of Trident K9, told theBoston Heraldthat the T-shirt \u201ctells a cartoon story of a deployment in Afghanistan where SEAL operators are chasing bad guys.\u201d\u201cThese dogs have saved more lives than we can count,\u201d Amann said. \u201cThey\u2019re more than a dog.

Roosevelt signed an executive order calling on all Philippine military forces to join the U.S. armed forces to fight Axis powers in World War II. At the time, the Philippines was under U.S. rule.Some 260,000 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers fought on behalf of the United States until the end of the war. Since the Philippines was a commonwealth of the United States, Filipinos who served in the U.S. military were entitled to the same benefits U.S. citizens received.In 1946, however, President Harry S. Truman signed the Recission Act, which stripped those benefits \u2014 citing $200 million the U.S. government gave the Philippines after the war.In 2009, seeking to make good on the recognition Filipino veterans deserved, lawmakers passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The law provided one-time payments of $15,000 to Filipino veterans who served in the war and are now U.S. citizens. Non-citizens who served received $8,000.\u201cThat amount is nothing compared to what they sacrificed for this country,\u201d Eric Lachica, executive director of the American Coalition for Filipino Veterans, told Philippine newspaper The Inquirer. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really asking for is full recognition and fair treatment.Ryan lauded Filipino veterans of World War II for their \u201cincredible valor and sacrifice,\u201d despite the fact that many who volunteered had no formal training.\u201cYou are such an integral part of this legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are here to immortalize the legacy of these great liberators.\u201dGregorio Azurin manned a .50-caliber machine gun in mountainous terrain in the Philippines when he came under attack by Japanese soldiers. He told the Yakima Herald in Washington that he jumped down a steep slope to escape the enemy.Azurin, 91, said he hid from the Japanese for three days without food before reuniting with his unit.\u201cThey all thought I was dead \u2014 they already had my name on the list\u201d of casualties, Azurin told the newspaper.The now-U.S. citizen said he received $15,000 from the U.S. government in 2009.Celestino Almeda, 100, was a high school teacher when the war started. He said he joined a guerrilla unit after the Japanese bombed Manila.\u201cOnce I saw five dead bodies piled on top of each other. Their bloody arms and limbs were hanging off a casket,\u201d he told The Inquirer. \u201cWho could forget those grim images of the atrocities of war? They are and will always be with me.\u201dAlmeda, now living in the United States, said he wrote the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs multiple times starting in 2000, seeking recognition of his service. He attended Wednesday\u2019s ceremony on Capitol Hill.\u201cIn every letter of denial that I received, the U.S. Department of Veterans insisted that there\u2019s no written document about my military service,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, \u2018Look, everything was in verbal at the time.\u2019 No one would sign a piece of paper while you were in the battleground.\u201dThe U.S. Congress approved the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Medal Act in December 2016.A statement from Ryan said a single Congressional Gold Medal was struck to honor the veterans.The Filipino Veterans Recognition and Education Project, an organization that promotes awareness of Filipinos\u2019 contributions to World War II, said bronze replicas would be presented to veterans during a separate ceremony Wednesday afternoon in McLean, Va. Officials are making the 1-pound replicas available to veterans or families for $50 each.\u201cLet this ceremony serve to insure that those who fought for freedom are never forgotten and are always remembered,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3584528008\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThey were a territory of the U.S. and promised benefits.

She did not even mention the President\u2019simmigration principles, announced October\u00a08.As Breitbart News reported, Nielsen previously noted that should she be confirmed to lead DHS, she would be \u201cready to work\u201d with lawmakers in passing an amnesty for DACA illegal aliens.\u201cCongress has a clear constitutional policymaking authority to change immigration law in order to develop a permanent solution for those individuals that were [DACA] recipients,\u201d Nielsen wrote in a pre-hearing document. \u201cIf confirmed, I will stand ready to work with Congress to provide any technical assistance needed towards a permanent, legal solution and towards enacting measures that enhance border security, interior enforcement, and our immigration system generally.\u201dAs Breitbart Newsreported, Nielsen\u2019s nomination to head DHS has been praised by the cheap foreign labor lobby, open borders advocates, and the Washington, D.C. national security establishment \u2013 whichallieditself with the failed \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement during the 2016 presidential election.Likewise, Nielsen chaired a committee at the World Economic Forum that promoted mass immigration to Europe and the U.S., claiming Western nations did not have a choice and needed to accept millions of migrants. That report, asBreitbart Newsreported, was co-authored by executives from multinational corporations and world banks.Additionally,\u00a0Breitbart Newsreportedon Nielsen\u2019s involvement with the Bush administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when more than 30,000 illegal aliens and foreign workers were able to come to the U.S. to take American blue-collar jobs\u00a0which those devastated by the natural disaster had hoped to get.Following Hurricane Katrina, 1.5 million Americans were displaced by the storm, and\u00a0easing of labor laws by the Bush administration left many looking for work outside of the Gulf Coast since illegal aliens and foreign workers quickly dominated the paid clean-up effort.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

And tax reform, in principle, is super popular among economists. But they have designed a bill so these economists do not think it would help growth, with one exception, and they think it would explode the deficit. So, you take a very popular concept, and you write it \u2014 the bill, in such a way that it becomes extremely unpopular among people who know most about it on both parties. That\u2019s a trick.

But, while they expected to find a comet-like chunk of ice passing by our sun, the object mysteriously failed to leave behind a\u00a0vapor trail as it grazed our home star. Instead, the still-unidentified chunk of ancient space debris hurtling at 60,000 MPH through our solar system left us with a host of new questions.First,\u00a0Oumuamua is exceptionally long and narrow \u2014 roughly 400 by about 40 meters.\u00a0The shape is unlike any asteroids in our own solar system. Paul Chodas, Manager of NASA\u2019s Centre for Near Earth Orbit Studies,calledit \u201ca strange visitor from a faraway star system, shaped like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen in our own solar system neighborhood.\u201dSecond, the lack of a comet-like tail of vaporized ice \u2014 despite passing even within Mercury\u2019s orbit \u2014 seems to be the result of unknown organic matter which shields its internal ice from the sun\u2019s immense heat. Also, it\u2019s red. And while some observations tagged it as similar to the shades we see from minerals present in our own system, others suggest that it is significantly darker.Queen\u2019s University Belfast\u2019s Dr. Michele Bannister of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey called Oumuamua \u201cthe opposite\u201d of what she was \u201cexpecting we might see.\u201d To her, it is the familiar aspects of the object that intrigue. \u201cIt\u2019s travelled for millions or billions of years \u2013 it could be older than our solar system. \u2026It\u2019s come from a very long way away, but it looks very familiar,\u201d she said.Her colleague, Professor\u00a0Alan Fitzsimmons, hopes for more time with the next exotic wanderer, bemoaning the short period of time between its discovery and departure:What would be great would be to find another one of these objects where we can say, \u2018yes, this object came from this particular star or particular region.\u2019 At the moment the only limit we\u2019ve got is an upper limit of about 10 billion years \u2013 because when our universe started, the materials weren\u2019t around to form a solid body like this.Of course, some are even convinced that Oumuamua couldprovideproof of extra-terrestrial life. Professor Fitzsimmons remains skeptical.\u201dWe expect these things out there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd looking at this object, the first object that\u2019s been detected, it has appearances of these natural objects that we\u2019d expect from another star \u2013 this looks exactly what we\u2019d expect.\u201dWhatever Oumuamua ultimately is, the data collected from its passing will be a hot topic among researchers for years to come \u2014 or, at least, until the next one.FollowNateChurch@Get2Churchon Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSpace turd.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

It\u2019s not working here. People are dying at alarming rates. If you value guns more than life and safety I don\u2019t understand:\u201dThen, after a few more tweets in which Nash disagreed with the statistics fans were throwing at him, the former MVP disputed that a gun in private hands ever saved anyone\u2019s life. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time someone had a gun in their home and it saved lives. I\u2019ll wait..,\u201d hetweeted.Nash then insisted that Americans are \u201cbrainwashed\u201d on guns, by those who are \u201cmaking money\u201d selling firearms.\u201cStill waiting on a compelling argument for guns in America. Not one holds water. The brainwashing by those making millions on the gun industry is disgusting yet successful. Absurd to see logic go out the window by many people I\u2019m assuming are loving human beings.\u201dHe next attacked the U.S. Constitution saying it was too old and needed to be altered to suit his liberal ideas.\u201cThe constitution is constantly being refined and changed. The gun lobby love to preach the good \u2018ol constitution (very old) argument. It\u2019s not very accurate in reality,\u201d he said.Nash then closed his argument, again insisting that the U.S. should throw away its American ideas and emulate the way other countries govern their people.\u201cStick to sports I know,\u201d he griped. \u201cWhy not emulate the success of many countries limiting access to guns and save thousands of lives each year in America? Seems well worth it. If your \u2018sense\u2019 of security is more important than thousands of lives I have a problem with that way of thinking\u201dStill, the South African-born Steve Nash asked for an argument in favor of the Second Amendment, and who are we to deny him one?As Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak said, \u201cSteve Nash was born in a country where black people were prevented by law from owning guns and could not therefore resist racial segregation and dispossession.\u201cHow\u2019s that for an argument?\u201dThat\u2019s pretty good.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthuston.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHe'd be speaking Russian if it were not for our guns.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Once completed, the gigantic ship will have a displacement of at least 50,000 metric tons and a conventional propulsion system, and will carry J-15 fighter jets and other carrier-borne aircraft.The new Chinese warship is expected to be bigger and better than the predecessor, CNS Liaoning.China Dailypoints out: \u201cThe new vessel will focus on duties for which most carriers are built: running combat-ready patrols and safeguarding the nation\u2019s maritime sovereignty and interests.\u201dAlthough U.S. military officials have warned that China canchallengethe American military, recent analysts have gauged the United States armed forces to be stronger the Chinese armed forces.Last month, the USSCarl Vinsonbegan to cruisedeepin the South China Sea amid U.S.-China tensions over Beijing\u2019s territorial disputes with several American allies in the region.Now, the state-administeredChina Dailynewspaper claims:Liu Zheng, chairman of Dalian Shipbuilding Industry in Liaoning province, said his company and its parent, China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, the world\u2019s largest shipbuilder, have acquired the ability to design and build aircraft carriers \u2026 Their capabilities have been gained through construction of the CNS Liaoning, China\u2019s first carrier, which was built based on a half-finished, imported Soviet-era vessel \u2026 which is in the final outfitting stage before starting sea trials.Around mid-February, the USSCarl Vinsondocked on the shores of one of those partners, the Philippines. The U.S. warship is also expected to stop on the waters of another ally in the region, Vietnam, marking the first visit from an American aircraft carrier since the end of the Vietnam War.China is engaged in territorial disputes in the South China Sea with both the Philippines and Vietnam.According to the most recent annual Jane\u2019s Defence Budgets Report authored by prominent research firm IHS Markit, the United States ($643 billion)outspentChina ($193 billion) on defense last year.Taking into account spending along with a plethora of other factors, the latest GFP index determined that the United States armed forces are more powerful than their Chinese counterpart.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt will make a nice new fish habitat on the bottom near the Scarborough Shoals.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

It entered Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone for the first time on Tuesday and passed through the strait on Wednesday, closely monitored by Taiwanese forces at all times.

The government typically cannot have access to those communications. In cases where it is necessary to study such communications, the FBI establishes a supposedly independent \u201ctaint team\u201d that sifts through the material and, theoretically, only passes on evidence to prosecutors that does not violate attorney-client privilege.However, critics allege that there is great potential for abuse, especially in a politically-charged case like this. They point out that such raids on attorneys are very rare, and argue that the president\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to privacy, Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and Sixth Amendment right to counsel have been compromised.Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, one of the country\u2019s foremost defense lawyers and a civil libertarian who supported Hillary Clinton for president, condemned the raid.\u201cIf this were Hillary Clinton being investigated and they went into her lawyer\u2019s office, the ACLU would be on every television station in America jumping up and down,\u201d hetoldFox News this week.However, the ACLU not only condones the raid on Trump\u2019s; it is applauding it.ACLU legal director David Colewroteon the organization\u2019s website:The ACLU is the nation\u2019s premier defender of privacy, and we\u2019ve long maintained that the right of every American to speak freely to his or her attorney is essential to the legal system. These rights are protected by the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, and we are second to none in defending them \u2014 often for people with whom we fundamentally disagree.But we also believe in the rule of law as an essential foundation for civil liberties and civil rights. And perhaps the first principle of the rule of law is that no one \u2014 not even the president, let alone his lawyer \u2014 is above the law.\u00a0 And no one, not even the president, can exploit the attorney-client privilege to engage in crime or fraud.The attorney-client privilege has always included a \u201ccrime-fraud exception,\u201d which provides that if you are using the attorney-client relationship to perpetrate a crime, there is no privilege.\u2026We don\u2019t know all the reasons and circumstances for the FBI search of Cohen\u2019s office and home. News reports suggest that the focus is on Cohen\u2019s payments to two women, adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal to suppress their stories of affairs with Donald Trump, and that these payments may have been illegal. But what is clear is that prosecutors had to overcome high hurdles to obtain the search warrant. That the warrant was issued is not a sign that the attorney-client privilege is dead. It is, on the contrary, a sign that the rule of law is alive.Notably, Cole did not mention the requirement that search warrants only be issued upon a finding of probable cause. In addition, the government apparently did not exhaust other means of obtaining the same information from Cohen that it seized in the raid.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

I was very intoxicated,\u201d she said.St. Clair said she was hoping for an internship at American Atheists and Silverman used this against her.\u201cI felt my interest in working for the organization was used as a way for him to have power so that I would have sex with him,\u201d she said.Last Friday, the board of American Atheists announced their decision to terminate Silverman just hours before BuzzFeed published astorychronicling the accusations of the two women.In astatementposted online, the chair of the American Atheists Board of Directors, Neal Cary, said that the board \u201chas reviewed internal documents and communications related to the initial complaint as well as evidence relating to the additional allegations brought to the Board\u2019s attention.\u201dThe announcement to terminate Silverman \u201cis based on these findings,\u201d the statement read.\u201cWe take our obligation to create safe and welcoming communities for our staff, volunteers, members and supporters very seriously,\u201d Nick Fish, American Atheists\u2019 national program director, said in a separate statement. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for the type of behavior alleged in these accounts. We will continue to demand the highest standards and accountability from our leaders, staff, and volunteers.\u201dSilverman has denied the charges,postingon Facebook: \u201cI want to make this perfectly clear: I categorically deny any wrongdoing, legally or ethically.\u201d His lawyer, Sebastian Ionno, has declared that he \u201chas never had a non-consensual sexual encounter.\u201dThis is not the first allegation of misconduct, however.Prior to Silverman\u2019s termination, American Atheists had said it was placing him on paid leave while investigating his financial conduct concerning the promotion of his 2015 book, \u201cFighting God: An Atheist Manifesto for a Religious World.\u201d Silverman had also allegedly appointed a woman he was sexually involved with to a senior position at American Atheists.As noted by Religion News, organized atheism has faced serious struggled with \u201ccharges of sexism and discrimination.\u201d In February, for instance, popular atheist writer and speaker Lawrence Krauss was accused of sexualmisbehaviorat Arizona State University, which included \u201cinappropriate behavior, groping women, ogling and making sexist jokes to undergrads,\u201d as well as telling an employee the university that he was going to \u201cbuy her birth control so she didn\u2019t inconvenience him with maternity leave.\u201dFollow Thomas D.

If we live in a country where we lose our careers over such things, there is no free speech.Nevertheless, there is a big difference between fighting for free speech and manufacturing a scenario that allows you to pose as a martyr, and in aWeekly Standardpiece published Tuesday, \u201cHow They Do \u2018Journalism\u2019 atNew YorkMagazine,\u201d that is exactly what Williamson does.After complaining in a recentWall Street Journalarticle about how every news outlet that wrote about hisAtlanticordeal failed to ask his side of the story (a valid complaint), Williamson informs us that he finally did receive an inquiry fromNew Yorkmagazine\u2019s Ed Kilgore.Ever since his comments about hanging women who have abortions surfaced, Williamson has suggested he was merely being provocative and said outright that he is not a fan of capital punishment. All well and good. But this does leave open the question of what Williamson honestly believes should happen to women who have abortions.And so, this is the question Kilgore asked of him: \u201cWhatisyour \u2018public policy recommendation\u2019 on appropriate punishment for women having abortions in a hypothetical criminalized abortion regime?\u201dExcept, rather than take advantage of this opportunity to clear the air by answering, Williamson offered this painful response to Kilgore:We have fifty states with fifty different political environments, and I would be surprised if, in a post-Roe world, the statutory situation in Oklahoma looked very much like that of Connecticut. People on the pro-choice side seek to shift the conversation to the question of the specifics of criminal sanction for obvious and shallow rhetorical purposes\u2014because that\u2019s an easy way to whip up emotional hysteria, preempting meaningful discourse rather than enabling it. The obviousness and stupidity of that gambit should be fairly obvious to any reasonably intelligent and fair-minded adult, but those are in unfortunately short supply.As noted, my original observations on this subject, including the Infamous Tweet, speak to the very dishonesty and stupidity of the stratagem upon which you are here relying. I can\u2019t believe that you are in fact unaware of my opposition to capital punishment.Am I the only one who got lost in the middle thing?With no small amount of help from a thesaurus, Williamson further explains his umbrage at the question:As any reasonably intelligent person will immediately detect, that question isn\u2019t actually a question; it is a rhetorical stratagem in the shape of a question, deployed for the purpose of lame partisan point-scoring in the form of blocks of texts shaped like journalism. It isn\u2019t discourse, but a facsimile of it, the journalistic equivalent of the Gem\u00fctlichkeit Spamwich created by Lisa Dziadulewicz of Sheboygan, Wisconsin: Just not quite right.It is, as I have noted, a dishonest strategy, because the question cannot be intelligently answered in a single sentence or two.Except, uhm, Kilgore did not ask for an answer in \u201ca single sentence or two.\u201d He asked a question, and the response was a neurotic word salad.To the surprise of no one, Kilgore went ahead and wrote his piece and accurately titled it, \u201cKevin Williamson Won\u2019t Tell Me What He Thinks Should Happen to Women Who Have Abortions\u201d\u2026\u2026and now Williamson is acting like the victim of a hit job.\u201cWhat you will not read about atNew Yorkmagazine,\u201d Williamson squeals, \u201cis the fact that I offered them a full account of my views on the subject, in the form of an essay onexactlyhow I think we should go about dealing with the legal prohibition of abortion.\u201dGo back and read that again.In response to a fairly straight-forward question, Williamson responded with two paragraphs of gobbledygook, butdidoffer to actually answer the question (for free) if they gave him a byline.And now, because someone chose not to offer him his platform, Kevin has climbed up on a cross.\u201cNew Yorkmagazine, in the words of its own editor,prefers a truncated, incomplete account, which is of course easier to distort and to misrepresent. Whatever that is, it isn\u2019t journalism,\u201d Williamson harrumphs.What a load of crap.Williamson was given the opportunity to clarify a position, and instead of doing so, he threw a poop-stained pile of defensive, pseudo-intellectual gibberish \u2014 which he apparently thought he could wrangle into a byline.His scheme failed, and now he\u2019s a victim, or something.But then \u2026 and this is my favorite part\u2026 \u00a0as if to proveNew Yorkmagazine correct, and even though he was able to cash in on this latest assault to his dignity for aWeekly Standardbyline, Williamson still does not answer the question \u2014 still does not tell us what he believes should happen to women who have an abortion.He does, however, promise to get plenty of mileage out of his newly christened victim status:A subject to which I expect to be returning in the near future is the way in which social media functions as a tool for thepreventionof discourse rather than an instrument enabling it. One of the lessons of the 20thcentury is that authoritarian movements are happy to use the instruments of liberal democracy as weapons against liberal democracy: Newspapers, mass media, political parties, even elections themselves can be used to undermine genuinely liberal and democratic institutions.Yes, by all means, and for the good of the world and human liberty, please do opine further aboutthis very important subject.Newsflash for the Never Trump-disabled\u2026Believe it or not, this \u201cprevention of discourse\u201d has been going on for years, and some of us have been sounding the alarm and fighting this fight for nearly a decade.But, you see, until right now, Never Trump didn\u2019t care that this was happening because it wasn\u2019t affectingtheir tribe.Because, until right now, the people being blacklisted, de-platformed, and scarlet lettered, werethose icky people, those on the right who embarrass the elbow-patched sensibilities of the Ross Douthats, David Frums, and Jonah Goldbergs. And as long as it was happening tothose icky people, andthey could still land gigs at \u201crespectable\u201d outlets like theWashington Post, New York Times,PBS, and theAtlantic,Never Trump\u2019smuh principleson the issue of free speech failed to kick in.Oh, but now thatthey came for me, for a fellow Never Trumper like Williamson, our soft-handed betters are ready to grab a musket.Yeah, well, we need fighters. We need men, not drama queen-crybabies who think they are entitled to aNew Yorkmagazine byline.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC.Follow his Facebook Pagehere.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWah wah wah.

Fifty more refugees have been put on a waiting list,\u201d Kiel Red Cross head Ilka\u00a0H\u00fcbner said.H\u00fcbner added that a \u201crefugee representative\u201d will support trainees during their apprenticeships. The goal is for the first refugee drivers to be on the road by August.Economics Minister Buchholz, from the libertarian Free Democrats\u00a0(FDP), said: \u201cWith this imaginative and praiseworthy initiative, the Logistics Organisation and the German Red Cross are building a bridge between the integration of refugees and the fight against the shortage of skilled workers.\u201dThe programme heads maintain that refugees will be screened for residency rights and work permits as well as for minimum language skills; however, figures released this weekrevealed80 per cent of Germans distrust the government\u2019s screening after the Bremen immigration office was found to have wrongly granted 1,200 migrants refugee status.The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) cameunder criticismfor the handling of Anis Amri\u2019s asylum case after it was found he had broken asylum rules, committed benefit fraud, and was issued papers under several fake identities.Before the Berlin Christmas market attack, Tunisian-born French resident Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhleldrovea\u00a019-tonne cargo truck into a crowd of people celebrating Bastille Day on July 14th, 2016, killing 86 and injuring over 400.And on April 7th, 2017, rejected Uzbek asylum seekerRakhmat Akilovdrove into a pedestrianised shopping area in Stockholm, Sweden, killing five and injuring 14 others.Follow Victoria Friedman onTwitterFollow @friedmanpressFollow Breitbart London onFacebookandTwitter.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhy not train them as arsonists too?

She will have to stay clear of drugs and alcohol during that period, as well, and will undergo periodic testing to assure authorities of compliance.Judge Sheeran also ordered the young woman to undergo a mental health assessment and refused to give her credit for time served.In March, Zolkowskiadmittedin court she lied about being raped outside the college in August 2017. She claimed to have been raped previously but did not report that incident.\u201cI called Delta College and falsely reported the rape on their campus,\u201d Zolkowski admitted. \u201cMy mother made the initial call, and I took the phone and continued to report.\u201d\u201cI was assaulted previously, not at Delta\u2019s campus,\u201d Zolkowski said. \u201cAnd because I was ashamed of circumstances of that when my mother called, I vented through Delta, which was very wrong of me. I should have been truthful from the very beginning, and I used Delta.\u201dBut after her report, investigators became skeptical of the woman\u2019s original claims when discrepancies began to appear. Authorities also found that Zolkowski seemed to have no physical results of an attack, no bruising or injuries. Indeed, Zolkowski reportedly refused to submit to a full medical exam after reporting the rape.Zolkowski\u2019s story continued to fall apart when the person she named as her assailant provided police with text messages from the purported victim in which she said she was raped shortly after they separated on the night in question. The texts also showed Zolkowski demanding he refuse to talk to police.In the end, Zolkowski was let off easy, as she faced a possible four years in prison and a $2,000 fine instead of the two years of probation and 45-day sentence she received.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthuston.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIf she was black there would be no jail just \"nothing to see here\".\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

In the 10 months since the election cycle started, nearly 130 political candidates were murdered.The most recent took place this week in Buena Vista Michoacan when a team of cartel gunmen shot and killed Javier Ure\u00f1a Gonzalez, the acting mayor for the municipality as he visited a small village. Ure\u00f1a assumed the role of acting mayor while his boss Lorenzo Barajas took leave to run for re-election.Ure\u00f1a\u2019s murder comes one day after a Oaxaca state congressional candidate was gunned down along with four of his associates. A team of gunmen killed Emigdio Lopez Avenda\u00f1o as he was visiting the town of San Vicente Coatlan in the southern part of the state.Earlier this week, a local campaign worker in the border city of Miguel Aleman, Tamaulipas, died when he drove up to the scene of a cartel gun-battle. Leonardo \u201cEl Chino\u201d Diaz and another campaign worker were driving along the highway when they were caught in crossfire. The van that Diaz was riding in caught fire, charring his remains. In response, local candidates canceled their campaign events.The murder in Miguel Aleman follows a drive-by shooting at the governor\u2019s mansion in Ciudad Victoria Tamaulipas. During the attack, the gunmen fired several shots out of an SUV, injuring a police officer that was guarding the building.Mexico is experiencing one of the bloodiest electoral cycles in history with more than120 candidates murdered since September 2017. The most recent accounting for assassinated political candidates as of June 25 is 130,according to Etellekt.Editor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.\u00a0 The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.Breitbart Texas\u2019 Cartel Chroniclesare published in both English and in their originalSpanish.

That much emerged from Tuesday\u2019s primary election race in Ohio\u2019s 12th congressional district, where Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor appears to have lost narrowly to Republican Troy Balderson in a historically conservative district.While the GOP still has a chance to hold onto the House, and looks likely to keep the Senate, there are five factors combining to create a \u201cBlue Wave,\u201d and Republicans from President Donald Trump on down will have to focus and fight hard to stop it.1. The agony of 2016.Nothing motivates an opposition party quite like the sting of defeat from the last election. That was true of Republicans after 2008, and it is especially true of Democrats after 2016, when they expected to win easily. The shock of the loss has sent some Democrats into conspiracy-theory craziness, but it has also motivated the party to organize more effectively to win whatever it can. Republicans cannot do much to stop Democrat enthusiasm \u2014 but they can do more to motivate their own voters.2. Health care.Obamacare continues to be a disaster. But while Republicans have repealed or weakened important parts of it, they have not replaced it with something better, and the cost of health care continues to plague middle-class families. Democrats have a terrible alternative \u2014 socialized medicine, i.e. \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2014 but at least they have a plan. The best argument against GOP control of both houses of Congress is that they could not find a solution even with near-complete control of the government.3. The border wall.Trump and his supporters can rattle off a long list of \u201cpromises kept\u201d: tax cuts; economic growth; jobs; one Supreme Court justice confirmed and another on the way; withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords; ending the Iran nuclear deal; and more. The one glaring exception is the border wall, which Trump claims has already begun but which has yet to find the necessary funds, either from Congress or from Mexico. The failure to keep this core promise could keep Trump voters home.4. The tone.Trump likes to fight, and he probably would not have achieved as much without his confrontational tactics, especially his tweets, which overcome the media filter (see #5, below). But his style does grate on some voters, who cannot see past the things Trump has said (or is sometimes falsely alleged to have said). Obama was also hostile to opponents, and it motivated Republicans to rebuke him at the polls. Democrats \u2014 and some suburban Republicans \u2014 are eager to send a message back to Trump this fall.5. Media war.\u201cBias\u201d does not begin to describe the media\u2019s unrelenting campaign to topple this president. The press has spent the better part of two years on a conspiracy theory of Russian collusion for which there remains no evidence. That has encouraged the opposition to expect Trump\u2019s imminent resignation or eventual impeachment, and to hold out against any compromise on major issues facing the country. The media\u2019s anti-Trump crusade has also hurt Republican candidates in down-ticket races nationwide.Of the five factors above, there is only one that Republicans can do anything about \u2014 at least in time for Election Day: namely, the border wall. That is why Trump is talking about a shutdown. Indeed, the prospect of a Blue Wave might embolden him to carry out his threat: if Democrats seem likely to win anyway, why not fight as hard as possible now for a wall that will be impossible next year? A shutdown fight could also invigorate the Republican base (see #1) \u2014 especially if Trump wins the funding he demands.Republicans have one other ace up their sleeves: Nancy Pelosi. The House Minority Leader insists that she will run for Speaker again if Democrats win a majority. But every Democrat who has won a special election in the past several months has done so while promisingnotto vote for her.Making the 2018 midterms about stopping Pelosi will probably not, by itself, be enough for Republicans to hang onto power. But it will help \u2014 and right now, it looks like Republicans will need all the help they can get.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

The illegal alien lived in a region of Iowa that was surrounded by sanctuary cities, asBreitbart Newsnoted.Bahena-Rivera\u2019s attorney is now seekinga gag orderto prevent the government from referring to the accused killer as an \u201cillegal alien\u201d or \u201cillegal immigrant,\u201d claiming he has legal status to be in the U.S.In a statement to Breitbart News, though, officials with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency said a search of federal records reveals that\u00a0Bahena-Rivera does not have a lawful immigration status in the country, indicating that he is, in fact, an illegal alien.\u201cA search of records by USCIS revealed Rivera did not make any DACA requests nor were any grants given,\u201d\u00a0USCIS spokesman Michael Bars said in a statement. \u201cWe have found no record in our systems indicating he has any lawful immigration status.\u201dBahena-Rivera worked at Yarrabee Farms, a dairy farm in Iowa, after he used a stolen or fake ID and fraudulent Social Security card to land a job. The farm owners originally claimed they used E-Verify to check the legality of Bahena-Rivera\u2019s immigration status, but later admitted that they did not use the system.The illegal alien, charged with first-degree murder in Tibbetts\u2019 killing, has been living in the U.S. for four to seven years.\u201cOn Aug. 21, ICE lodged a detainer with the Poweshiek County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Cristhian Bahena-Rivera, 24, an illegal alien from Mexico, after he was arrested on murder charges,\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials said in a statement to Breitbart News.Police say Bahena-Rivera left Tibbetts\u2019 body in a cornfield, placing corn stalks over her to hide her death. Foreign nationals, specifically illegal aliens, are often incentivized by employers to migrate to the Midwest\u00a0to take low-wage farming and meatpacking jobs.John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) during Thursday\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe \u201d on MSNBC weighed in on Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s potential confirmation to the Supreme Court amid sexual misconduct allegations from over 30 years ago by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, saying the GOP is signaling that they are \u201cOK\u201d with \u201cputting someone who committed attempted rape on the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201dMSNBC\u2019s Willie Geist asked, \u201c[D]o you believe that Dr. Ford should testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday as she\u2019s been invited?\u201d\u201cI hope that she does, because I\u2019m afraid that what the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee really want is they want her to go away,\u201d Schiff replied. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the country to hear from her, and they certainly don\u2019t want the country to hear from her live and on television. She\u2019s absolutely right: the FBI should do a thorough vetting of these allegations. The Senate shouldn\u2019t simply rely on hearing two conflicting accounts and decide, \u2018Well, we\u2019re OK with not knowing. We\u2019re OK with the fact we might be putting someone who committed attempted rape on the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019\u201dHe continued,\u00a0\u201cThey should get to the bottom of this. And it wouldn\u2019t take that long to do. This is the same crowd that waited a year to fill the last vacancy during the Obama administration on the Supreme Court, so why this rush? And I think they realize they have a very imperfect candidate, in fact, they may have a candidate who has committed attempted rape.\u201dFollow Trent Baker on Twitter@MagnifiTrent\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHe had no problem putting WJC in the White House who DID commit rape.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

After he participated in a press conference aimed at highlighting issues with police violence, the same issues that Kaepernick claimed to be targeting with his protests.\u201cIt is unfortunate. I did a press conference in support of Colin Kaepernick, using his status to put a spotlight on issues in policing that need to be fixed,\u201d RaymondtoldtheNew York Daily News. \u201cBecause of the controversy a lot of cops criticized him. Me being aligned with him was seen as standing with the enemy.\u201dHowever, in the interview with theDaily News, Raymond also acknowledged that complaints from his fellow officers regarding how he has handled domestic violence cases, also played a part in preventing his promotion.There have been several domestic violence related complaints about Raymond, a senior NYPD official told theDaily News.According to theDaily NewsviatheHill:One of the allegations against him dates to an incident from September 2017. A woman allegedly called the police after seeing an ex-boyfriend.Upon arriving, the police officers reportedly saw an order of protection, but Raymond let the man go.Raymond disputed the story, saying that\u00a0a woman took a bat to her ex-boyfriend\u2019s car while he was in it with another woman. Raymond said that the man called the police and that, based on the circumstances, there was no reason to arrest him.He told the newspaper that officers went to internal affairs after the incident.\u2018These cops went thinking the numbers would give their claims more plausibility, and unfortunately the department is choosing to entertain this and use it as a dagger to end my promotion,\u2019 Raymond said.Raymond went on to say,\u00a0\u201cThey are not happy with me. I don\u2019t enjoy having to speak out, but it\u2019s historically what makes the department budge.\u201dColin Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since the end of the 2016 season. The same year in which he launched his anthem protests. Since that time hundreds of other players have taken part in some form of protests during the playing of theStar-Spangled Banner.Kaepernick has launched a grievance claim against the NFL, claiming that the league\u2019s owners colluded to keep him out of the league due to his anthem protests.Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter@themightygwinn\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBye felicia.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

However, officials with the Parker County Sheriff\u2019s Office said things went awry.First, the photographer purportedly slipped away with a male wedding guest. A security guard, who was an off-duty deputy with the sheriff\u2019s office, interrupted the encounter.According toWFAA, the arrest warrant stated: \u201cHe was advised by the wedding party that a female subject [Mehta] had been found having sexual intercourse with a male there.\u201dThe document also said the suspect was told her behavior was inappropriate after which she exited the manor and began to yell outside near a water fountain. This time, officers asked her to leave the property, but, instead, she \u201cwent to a tree nearby and began to urinate.\u201dThen, deputies placed Mehta into a patrol car. There, she threatened officers as they drove her to the Parker County Jail, according to the affidavit. \u201cY\u2019all families will be dead by Christmas\u201d and \u201cY\u2019all daughters are dead,\u201d she ranted at the arresting officers,according totheFort Worth Star-Telegram. Allegedly, Mehta also told deputies:\u00a0 \u201cMy dad is going to find out about this, and y\u2019all are (expletive) dead. D-E-A-D.\u201dAuthorities said they noticed a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol\u201d on the suspect. At the jail, they searched Mehta and found a bottle of prescription alprazolam in her jacket pocket. This is an anti-anxiety medication often sold under the brand name Xanax,according toWebMD. Police believed Mehta mixed the medicine with alcohol.Reportedly, Mehta also is a swimsuit model who goes by the professional name Max McIntyre and she regularly posts modeling videos toYouTubeandInstagram.Mehta apparently did not respond on Monday to media inquiries regarding her arrest. WFAA spoke to family members who shared a very different account of what happened on Saturday night. A woman who indicated she was the suspect\u2019s sister told them Mehta was given spiked drinks unknowingly and fell ill while working at the wedding.\u201cShe said she went outside, and she said these two men tried to approach her and do inappropriate things,\u201d said the woman. \u201cAnd she said she was yelling and trying to get help, and things got turned around in a negative way.\u201dParker County Jail records show Mehta faces a felony charge of obstruction or retaliation and public intoxication.

However, by Monday, it could be down to four. One of the eight minority coaches is Carolina\u2019s Ron Rivera who is Puerto Rican, so the NFL could be down to just three black coaches, which might be deemed unacceptable by some since the league has 70 percent black players.So a storm is brewing.The Fritz Pollard Alliance is named for the pro football\u2019s first black coach, who took over the Akron Pros in 1921. A graduate of Brown University, Pollard was considered one of the best running backs of his era.The Pollard Foundation was instrumental in the NFL implementing \u201cThe Rooney Rule\u201d in 2002. Which states that NFL teams must interview minority candidates for any head coaching opening.According to the website of the Fritz Pollard Foundation their mission is:\u201cEncouragingadoptionof rules and practices that encourage diversity on NFL teams; educating NFL team owners and managers regarding the availability of minority candidates for team staff positions; advocating the hiring and promotion of minority candidates in NFL team staff hierarchy through public education and communication with team and league ownership and management.\u201dIn late November, the Pollard Alliance put out alistof 11 minority assistant coaches who they feel NFL teams should interview for head coaching spots:Patriots linebackers coach Brian Flores, Cowboys defensive backs coach and defensive passing game coordinator Kris Richard, Eagles assistant head coach/running backs coach Duce Staley, Vikings defensive coordinator George Edwards, Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, Falcons special teams coordinator Keith Armstrong, Falcons assistant head coach/wide receivers coach Raheem Morris, Bills defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier, former Bengals defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, former Lions and Colts head coach Jim Caldwell and Jackson.But what if none of these guys are hired? Then the NFL could have a major battle on their hands with the Pollard Alliance and some reporters, over their low number of black coaches in a league with a majority black players.Stanford head coach David Shaw, who isn\u2019t on this list, could emerge as a hot NFL head coaching candidate.There are rumors the Cincinnati Bengals coach Marvin Lewis, who is black, might step down after the season, so the number of black NFL coaches could decline even more. Though, there are rumors the Bengals might hire Jackson or Joseph.But with the regular season about to end, and a number of coaches about to be fired, including three black individuals, the NFL\u2019s lack of black head coaches looks to be a big story in the coming weeks and months.Stay tuned.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4260570437\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nTroof\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) identified as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d on her Texas Bar registration card, raising new questions about whether the 2020\u00a0Democrat presidential contender used her claim of Native American heritage to advance her\u00a0career, according to a report released Tuesday evening.TheWashington Postobtainedthe registration card, which was previously undisclosed, during an open records\u00a0request. As thePostnoted, the card was handwritten using blue ink and signed by Warren. The card shows Warren wrote \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d for her \u201crace\u201d and is dated April 1986. A spokesperson for the\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0Democrat did not dispute the card\u2019s authenticity, according to the newspaper.In a brief statement with thePost, Warren once again apologized for claiming Native American heritage.\u201cI can\u2019t go back,\u201d shesaid. \u201cBut I am sorry for furthering confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and harm that resulted.\u201dThePostreports:Warren, asked in a brief interview Tuesday if she\u2019d intended the apology to include labeling herself as Native American when at the University of Pennsylvania and at Harvard University, replied \u201cyes.\u201d She gave the same response when asked if it included labeling herself as a minority in the Association of American Law Schools directory.\u201cI told him I was sorry for furthering confusion about tribal citizenship,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI am also sorry for not being more mindful about this decades ago. We had a good conversation.\u201d CNN reported her broader apology on Monday.This development comes after the Cherokee Nation confirmed Warren apologized for taking a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage.Last Friday, Tribe spokeswoman Julie Hubbard said that the senator had apologized \u201cfor causing confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and the harm that has resulted.\u201d\u201cI understand that she apologized for causing confusion on tribal sovereignty and tribal citizenship and the harm that has resulted,\u201dsaidHubbard. \u201cThe chief and secretary of state appreciate that she has reaffirmed that she is not a Cherokee Nation citizen or a citizen of any tribal nation.\u201dWarren released what she said were her DNA test results in October in a failed attempt to bolster her prior claims of Native American heritage.The DNA test was conducted by a lab in Georgia, which provided no chain of custody of the DNA sample from Warren to them. They forwarded the data results of that DNA test to Stanford University professor Carlos D. Bustamante, who analyzed that data and wrote a report based on his analysis of it. Bustamante\u2019s report stated that Warren shared DNA with residents of Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, not Native Americans who are members of tribes in the United States. The results of that analysis, published on October 16, showed Warren may have a common ancestor who lived approximately six to 10 generations ago with residents of Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. These results mean that at the very least, Warren shares 1/1024 common DNA with residents of Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. At the very most, she shares 1/64 common DNA with residents of Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.She had previously said her Native American roots were part of \u201cfamily lore.\u201dThe Cherokee Nation complained then that tribal nations, not DNA tests, determine citizenship and that Warren was \u201cundermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\u201d\u201cA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship,\u201d\u00a0Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said at the time. \u201cCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person\u2019s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America.\u201d\u201cIt makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven,\u201d he added.Warren\u2019s campaign declined to comment Friday.The Associated Press andMichael Patrick\u00a0Leahycontributed to this report.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nShe lied.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the Sri Lanka bombings.The report casts further doubt on claims by senior Sri Lankan officials that they were not aware of any impending attacks on Christians or threat of jihadi terrorism on their soil. Sri Lankan President\u00a0Maithripala Sirisena announced Tuesday he had asked for the resignations\u00a0of his head\u00a0of national police and secretary\u00a0of defense after a letter surfaced from Indian intelligence agencies warning prior to the massacre that Islamic terrorists were planning to attack Christians in the country\u00a0on Easter.The president denied knowledge\u00a0of the letter, as did the nation\u2019s prime minister, both condemning the senior intelligence agents who kept the information from them.Local and international media reports have identified Zahran Hashim, the founder of a Sri Lankan Islamist group known as National Thawheed Jama\u2019ath (NTJ), as the \u201cmastermind\u201d of the attacks. At press time, authorities do not believe he personally conducted any of the six suicide attacks. Some reportsclaima man appearing in Islamic State propaganda claiming responsibility for the attack \u2013 the only one not covering his face \u2013 is Hashim.In theDaily Mirrorreport, Hashim\u2019s sister\u00a0Mohomed Hashim Madaniya claimed the entire Hashim family went \u201cmissing\u201d a week before the attacks and distances herself from the suspected jihadist. The alleged current head of the NTJ,\u00a0Moulavi Thawufeek, also distances the group from Hashim and claims that NTJ had been warning Sri Lankan police for years that Hashim was spreading violent Islamic beliefs through sermons at his mosque.Hashim is believed to have founded NTJ in 2011. Sri Lankan police stillidentifyhim as the leader of the group. Conflicting reports have identified NTJ as a splinter group from a larger similarly named outfit called the Sri Lanka Tawheed Jama\u2019ath, though it is unclear what relationship the groups have or if they ever truly split apart.Deputy Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene went further to say that Hashim\u2019s group \u201chad split from the main body\u201d of the NTJ, which he founded.Hashim had made a name for himself with thousands of followers on Facebook and Youtube with jihadist screeds calling for violence against non-Muslims. All those speaking to theDaily Mirrorclaim they distanced themselves from him after he began publishing the videos.A representative for the Badriya Mosque in Kattankudy, the neighborhood where Hashim preached, told the newspaper that the area hosted nearly a dozen fundamentalist mosques:Katankudy [sic] a small area of land with one of the highest density of population comprises 63 mosques. 8 of the mosques follow the Fundamentalist strand openly and the other barring 3 mosques follow \u201cdifferent degrees of wahabist ideology\u201d H. M Ameer from the Badriya Mosque told the Daily Mirror. \u201cThe Jammiyathul Ulama are also supporters of the Wahabi ideology\u201d he and Jaseem told the Daily Mirror.Ameer told the newspaper that members of the mosque \u201cinformed authorities of [Hashim] starting in 2012.\u201d\u201cWe in fact gave dockets to 11 authorities including the Secretary of Defence, the Inspector General and the Attorney General detailing the extremism carried out by Zahran and his ideology,\u201d Ameer told the Daily Mirror.Another member of the mosque, Mohomed Jaseem, told the newspaper, \u201cWe told them that these guys were preaching some crazy radicalised fundamentalism and that there is a threat to our lives. We did this from as far back as 2012.\u201dHashim had reportedly violently attacked a group of Sufi Muslims in 2017 over his belief that they were not radical enough in their faith.Members\u00a0of Sri Lankan\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s cabinet were the first to report that the government had reason to be aware that jihadists were planning to kill Christians\u00a0on Easter.\u00a0Minister of Telecommunications, Foreign Employment & Sports Harin Fernandopublisheda letter on Twitter the day of the attack. He claimed it detailed the threat to Sri Lankan authorities, who did nothing to prevent the attack. He and other cabinet members joined Wickremesinghe in blaming Sirisena\u2019s government for barring them all from regular intelligence briefings, keeping them unaware of the information.Sirisenaclaimedon Wednesday that his intelligence\u00a0officials failed to inform him\u00a0of the threat, as well, and promised a complete overhaul of security leadership in the country.Suicide bombers attacked three churches and three hotels known to be frequented by foreigners on Easter, apparently targeting children. Police have arrested at least 24 people in relation to the six bombings at press time. The death toll stands at 359 people, mostly Christians.Follow Frances Martel onFacebookandTwitter.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBoom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

It\u2019s a reference to the biologically female women who have transitioned to men but also retain reproductive organs and become pregnant.\u201cThey basically said that, you know, women and people who identify as women are not the only people who are affected by anti-abortion laws,\u201d said Cox. \u201cThat people who identify as women are not the only people who get pregnant and \u2014 we can applaud for that. It\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201cIf I were that trans man, I would really want to have language that incorporated and included my experience,\u201d Cox added. \u201cThinking about this reminded me that a language is also a place of struggle, but that this isn\u2019t just about being politically correct.The actor continued:This is not just about virtue signaling, that when we use language that excludes people on pertinent issues it can jeopardize their health and well being. This is about language that is appropriate and fully inclusive is a matter of life and death for so many people out there.\u201dFor me, as a trans woman, I can\u2019t get pregnant. I\u2019m very grateful for that! But it\u2019s an issue that I don\u2019t actually have to think about. But if we are the person who has to deal with the issue, it is so important to be inclusive and to have our issues dealt with.Cox, who is biologically male, is Hollywood\u2019s most high-profilecampaigneron trans issues. Cox became the\u00a0first openly transgender person to be featured on the cover ofTimemagazine and also be nominated for a\u00a0Primetime Emmy award.Follow Ben Kew onFacebook, Twitter at@ben_kew,\u00a0or\u00a0email him at bkew@breitbart.com.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOk, I suggest substituting pronouns with \"freak\" when dealing with trans anything.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The Chinese Communist Party claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea despite a 2016 international tribunal finding that Beijing\u2019s claims were incorrect and its construction of artificial islands in Philippine and Vietnamese territory is illegal.China vowed to ignore the ruling and has since continued sending fishing vessels into sovereign Philippine waters. China\u2019s practices prompted multiple protests in Manila this month following the sinking of a Philippine fishing ship anchored by Recto Bank, territory that the international community, barring the Chinese communist regime, considers indisputably Filipino. The Chinese ship that rammed into the Filipino fishermen sunk the ship and fled, leaving them to drown. The men were ultimately rescued by a Vietnamese ship that legally passed near their wreckage.Duterte\u2019s spokesman, Salvador Panelo, initially called the sinking \u201cbarbaric,\u201d but Duterte himself has insisted that an investigation exonerated China and that he would not make any moves against Beijing\u2019s large People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA).Speaking to Pastor Apollo\u00a0Quiboloy on his television program,Give Us This Day, on Wednesday, Duterte reiterated a repeated vow that he would only attack China if America attacks first. He urged the United States to attack China militarily \u2013 an act of war \u2013 in response to the Recto Bank sinking.The Mutual Defense Treaty between Washington and Manila requires the U.S. military to retaliate if a foreign power attacks the Philippines.\u201cI\u2019m calling now America. I\u2019m invoking the RP-US pact,\u201d Duterte said. \u201cI would like America to gather all their 7th Fleet in front of China. I\u2019m asking them now. I will join them. I will ride on the boat where admiral of the U.S.\u201d\u201cWhen the Americans say, we\u2019re here now, ready, I will press them,\u201d headded, suggesting that such an act of war would be \u201cthe end of Palawan,\u201d the province of the Philippines closest to the triggering incident. \u201cPalawan may be devastated, occupied or their will be nuclear bombs. We will dry up. So nothing will grow here, we can just wait, just like a big hole coming our way, to suck us to eternity and then we can sing the \u2018Mona Lisa.\u2019 And they just lie there, and they die there.\u201dAccording to thePhilippine Star, the naval fleet Dutertedemandedto come protect his country, the 7th Fleet, is currently headquartered in Japan and boasts 20,000 sailors.The Mutual Defense Treaty binds the Philippines and the United States to \u201cact to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes.\u201dIn the same interview with Quiboloy, Duterteinsistedthat he had the right to grant Chinese fishing ships the privilege of fishing in Philippine waters, even though the Philippine constitution explicitly forbids the president from allowing any foreigners to do so.\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m the owner, and I\u2019m just giving the fishing rights,\u201d Duterte said of the Spratly Island waters. He went on to insist that he had not \u201clost\u201d the South China Sea to China and that he could not do anything to enforce the 2016 Hague ruling against China because \u201cthe property is in their possession\u201d and it would take military action greater than what the Philippines is capable of to remove them.Duterte\u2019s administration has floated the possibility of invoking the Mutual Defense Treaty against China on multiple occasions. Last week, Duterte accused Washington of wanting a war with China and using the Philippines as \u201cbait,\u201d insisting that Americans fight the war themselves.\u201cNow I say, you bring your planes, your boats to South China Sea,\u201d Dutertesaid. \u201cFire the first shot and we are just here behind you. Go ahead, let\u2019s fight. Let America declare the war. Let them assemble all their armaments there in the South China Sea. Fire the first shot and I\u2019d be glad to do the next.\u201d\u201cThere is always America pushing us, egging us \u2026 making me the bait. What do you think Filipinos are, earthworms?\u201d he asked.Panelo, Duterte\u2019s spokesman, suggested invoking the treaty against China over the Recto Bank incident in June.\u201cIf that is what is stated in the treaty, then we will follow that\u2013if that is the agreement,\u201d Panelosaidat the time. \u201cWhatever the agreement tells us to do, we will do that,\u201d he added.U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Kim Sungsaidin response to the incident in June that the State Department is aware of the treaty and that \u201cany armed attack on Filipino vessels,\u00a0Filipino aircraft will trigger our obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty.\u201dIt is not clear if the Recto Bank incident fits that definition. No reports suggested that the Chinese fishing vessel that was illegally present in those waters was armed, or that it used weapons to sink the Philippine ship. Instead, eyewitnesses said the Chinese ship rammed itself into the Philippine ship while it was anchored, essentially tearing it apart.The Chinese communist regime has insisted that the incident was accidental and civilian in nature.\u201cI\u2019d like to stress that this is only an accidental collision between fishing boats at sea. It is irresponsible and counter-constructive to link this incident with China-Philippines friendship or even make political interpretations out of it,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in June. \u201cIn a highly responsible attitude, China will continue to earnestly investigate into this matter. We are ready to enhance communication with the Philippine side on the investigation, increase understanding, dispel mistrust and find out what actually happened.\u201dFollow Frances Martel onFacebookandTwitter.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4543815369\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYeah, one Puerto Rico was enough.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

I\u2019ll fucking throw you down these stairs like a fucking punk\u00a0\u2026 you\u2019re gonna call me \u2018Fredo,\u2019 take a fucking swing?\u201dAccording toNewsbusters, Cuomo used the word \u201cfuck\u201d nearly 25 times.CNN spokesperson Matt Dornic expressed support for Cuomo\u2019s outburst, writing on Twitter: \u201cChris Cuomo defended himself when he was verbally attacked with the use of an ethnic slur in an orchestrated setup. We completely support him.\u201dIronically, anti-Trump CNN contributor Ana Navarro used the term \u201cFredo\u201d to insult Donald Trump Jr. on Cuomo\u2019s show back in January, a comparison the host did not object to.\u201cDoes CNN\u2019s head of PR still think \u2018Fredo\u2019 is an ethnic slur after watching this? Because if it\u2019s the N word for Italians like@ChrisCuomosays, I don\u2019t understand why Chris seems so at ease with someone saying it here. An excuse just as fake as his news,\u201d Trump Jr.tweetedafter footage of Cuomo\u2019s meltdown went viral.Even President Donald Trump weighed in on Cuomo,tweeting: \u201cI thought Chris was Fredo also.\u201d\u201cWould Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have any weapon. He\u2019s nuts!\u201d hewrotein a subsequent tweet.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nDo we have a new definition of race?

Do you think the party is going to resonate with young people? people your age and young?MEGHAN MCCAIN:I really worry about it because \u2014 and the numbers show this \u2014 whatever you say about the left, there are people like [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] that do a really good job at speaking to young people. And I think for us, and I always laugh, like, the young Republican groups start at 40. I think post-Trump America, for the party, is going to be very, very dark to rebuild.HOOVER:I don\u2019t know how we rebuild, but Cindy, you just shook your head. As you think about your children, your children and having Republican appeal, this concerns you?CINDY MCCAIN:It concerns me very much and I\u2019ll speak from my own homestate where the party has simply left normal, what I would consider normal Republicans behind. Until our party goes back to what we were best at, and that was an open system, an open tent, where we invited everybody in. Those are the days that I grew up in Republican politics and those were the good days. President Trump has done some things, that you know, all of us, as Meghan said, it\u2019s been\u2013they\u2019ve been controversial, they\u2019ve been different from what any other president has done and not in good ways.

(AP) \u2014 Mississippi flushed away a golden chance at the Golden Egg.Luke Logan missed a 35-yard extra point after Ole Miss receiver Elijah Moore was penalized for celebrating a touchdown by crawling and pretending to urinate like a dog, and Mississippi State escaped with a 21-20 victory Thursday night in the 116th Egg Bowl.\u201cThat\u2019s not who we are. We\u2019ve been a disciplined team all year, and so just disappointed that happened,\u201d Rebels coach Matt Luke said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who he is. Elijah is a good kid, and he just got caught up in the moment.\u201dOle Miss (4-8, 2-6 Southeastern Conference) pulled within a point with 4 seconds remaining on Matt Corral\u2019s 2-yard pass to Moore, but Logan hooked the extra point after Moore cost the Rebels 15 yards. The extra yards also prevented Mississippi from going for a winning 2-point conversion.The penalty was another in a long line of unsportsmanlike conduct fouls between these two teams in recent years, and oddly not even the first one featuring a player pretending to pee. Luke said he knew that as emotions flared in the annual rivalry game that showboating would need to be avoided.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWe talked about it. We had five penalties. We just wanted to play a clean game. Nothing after the whistles or before the whistles was going to help us win the ballgame.\u201dMississippi State (6-6, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) beat Ole Miss at home for the first since 2013, possibly saving second-year coach Joe Moorhead\u2019s job.Moorhead was fiery in his defense of the job his staff has done with this team, overcoming a litany of academic suspensions and several injuries to key players.\u201cTo me it was an exclamation point on the narrative that I\u2019m not the right man for this job or this team, or that I can\u2019t coach in this league,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cThis is my school, my team, and this is my program. They\u2019ll have to drag my Yankee ass out of here.\u201dThe teams combined for seven sacks and 17 tackles for loss, and Mississippi State won the turnover battle 3-1. The Bulldogs\u2019 Erroll Thompson had 11 tackles, one for a loss, a pass deflection and a forced fumble.\u201cErroll\u2019s our team captain, you know, and he has the confidence of the team,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cFor him to play the way he did, and just the entire defense, it was a great team win.\u201dThe Bulldogs scored two first-half touchdowns, the first on Nick Gibson\u2019s 27-yard run and the second on the next possession on quarterback Garrett Shrader\u2019s 1-yard run. Ole Miss responded with two touchdowns of its own, with J.R. Plumlee scoring on a 2-yard run and Jerrion Ealy on a 5-yarder to tie it at 14 at the half.Midway through the third quarter, the Bulldogs sacked Plumlee three times on the same drive, the third forcing a fumble. Seven plays later, Shrader scored on a 5-yard run to put Mississippi State up 21-14.After pulling Plumlee in favor of Corral, Ole Miss had two different red-zone opportunities in the fourth quarter. The other ended with a Marcus Murphy interception.On the final drive of the game, Mississippi State committed three of its five total penalties and Ole Miss ran nine plays inside the 15 before eventually connecting for the touchdown.THE TAKEAWAYOle Miss: The Rebels are young and continue to show signs of life under Luke, but inconsistent play and the lack of a clear offensive strategy are the biggest reasons they\u2019ll be sitting at home this bowl season.Mississippi State: After a long season that fell well short of expectations, an emotional home win over a hated rival might just be enough to keep Moorhead from losing his job. But maybe not.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4706625754\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHe's a goot boy, a very goot boy.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

To that end, even the display of Christmas wreaths is forbidden, though the manager did hold a \u201cHoliday Wreath contest.\u201dLiberty Counsel reports MACO Managementrespondedto the demand letter with its own letter, signed by Tammy Delcour, regional manager of MACO Management, who cited the company\u2019s own rules and regulations but failed to cite any HUD or \u201cGovernment Fair Housing\u201d regulations.\u201cWe have never in the past or will in the future hamper a resident from decorating to their desire on the inside of their residence as they choose,\u201d Delcour wrote. \u201cWe do however have rules and regulations for the outside and the structures themselves.\u201dThe litigation non-profit notes:After Liberty Counselsenta\u00a0follow-up response\u00a0requesting MACO rescind the decoration ban in order to avoid receiving a complaint with HUD for civil rights violations, MACOissueda\u00a0memo to residents. The memo states that residents may decorate the interior of their homes and now \u201ctheir front door and porch area with more overtly religious displays,\u201d yet continues to ban yard displays deemed \u201creligious:\u201d \u201cWhen decorating with yard scenes we must stay neutral within the community so no religion is offended or singled out \u2026 We as a management company look for a policy which appropriately balanced the beliefs of all while ensuring we are not perceived to favor one religion over another.\u201d\u201cThis conflates the private speech of residents with the speech of the management company,\u201d Liberty Counsel states, adding the company is violating the Fair Housing Act, which bans discriminating against residents on the basis of religion.\u201cChristmas is a nationally recognized holiday, and banning individuals\u2019 religious decorations or celebrations in a federally subsidized or managed residential facility violates the Fair Housing Act and other federal laws,\u201d Liberty Counsel asserts. \u201cAny federal law or funding requirement that would restrict or prohibit residents\u2019 religious holiday decorations would violate the First Amendment rights of the residents.\u201dMat Staver, Liberty Counsel chairman, said he welcomes HUD\u2019s investigation into MACO Management\u2019s practices.\u201cMACO\u2019s banning Grandview Estates residents from their longstanding traditions of displaying Christmas or other religious holiday decorations constitutes discrimination based on religion,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing in Federal regulations, the lease agreement or residential regulations supports such a ban. MACO Management Company must allow residents to decorate their duplexes, just like they have in the past.\u201d\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nFire the manager.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

His knowledge of the law\u2026 his passion\u2026 his articulateness. His sincerity!\u201d Barbra Streisand said, pouring praise on the partisan lawmaker. \u00a0\u201cHe speaks the truth and would make a great president.\u201dBabs may want to pomp the breaks because as it stands, only 27 percent of America has a positive opinion of Rep. Schiff according to YouGovdata.\u00a0The same polling outfit reports that President Trump\u2019s approval among Americans sits at39 percent.This wild declaration from Streisand comes just a month after the two-time Academy Award-winner and apparent Constitutional law expertsaid\u201cimpeachment is the sober process envisioned by the Founders to counter such a threat\u201d as President Trump.Streisand followed that whopper of a hot take up by listing\u00a0six reasons why she thinks Trump should be impeached. Including:1. Trump bribed and extorted the Ukraine with taxpayer money to investigate a political rival for personal gain.2. Trump believes he is above the law. He thinks presidents can do anything.3. Trump threatened a witness, a career diplomat, during the impeachment inquiry.4. Trump clearly lied and obstructed justice in the Mueller investigation.5. Trump dismisses intelligence briefings about Russia\u2019s role in undermining our democracy, and repeats Kremlin disinformation on Ukraine.6. Trump is personally profiting from the presidency, violating the emoluments clause. He charges our government to stay at his resorts.Jerome Hudson is\u00a0Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and\u00a0author of the bestselling book50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know.Orderyour copy today.

Barack Obama (D-IL) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) put politics aside and offered their support to President George W. Bush during the 2008 financial crisis.In contrast, 2020 candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Vice President Joe Biden have used the coronavirus to trash President Donald Trump.Bidendeliveredan address in which he accused President Trump of misleading the public about the outbreak, delaying tests, and \u201chollowing out\u201d federal agencies (a claim that has beendebunked). He introduced his own plan for coronavirus \u2014 though several elements of the plan seemed to have been copied from Trump\u2019s own policy.Sanderscalledfor Trump to be replaced \u2014 at least on the coronavirus issue \u2014 by a panel of \u201cexperts\u201d and Congress.Rather than offering the president their unqualified support, the Democrats struck a partisan note in mid-crisis.The contrast to Obama\u2019s and McCain\u2019s conduct in 2008 is stark. Though Obama and McCain were locked in a bitter political fight \u2014 with Obama declining to join McCain in suspending his campaign \u2014 bothdeferredto the sitting president.Though the subsequent Wall Street bailout \u2014 which passed with both Obama and McCain\u2019s support \u2014 was controversial, both made an effort to show their joint support for the country\u2019s president in a moment of crisis.In his address to the nation on Wednesday evening, President TrumpurgedAmericans\u00a0to put \u201cpolitics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify as one nation and one family.\u201dJoel B.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Tuesdayproposedlegislation that would extend cash benefits from the latest emergency coronavirus relief measure to members of \u201cmixed status\u201d families and stressed that the next stage of relief must extend cash payments to non-citizens.An individual must have a Social Security number to receive the cash benefit portion provided in the CARES Act \u2014 a requirement that has beenmetwith heavy criticism from several members of the Democrat Party, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Her fellow \u201cSquad\u201d member agrees, with her press release lamenting that the bill \u201cleaves out many noncitizens and mixed status families\u2014even if members of the family are citizens.\u201dAs a result, Omar introduced the\u00a0Recovery Rebates Improvement Act which \u201cfixes the major error by expanding the special rule for the military in the CARES Act.\u201d However, Omar also called for comprehensive legislation in the next relief package to \u201censure that all noncitizens, whether holding a SSN or not, can access these relief payments.\u201d\u201cIt is absurd and cruel that a taxpaying, mixed status couple or family could be excluded from this relief,\u201d Omarsaidin a statement.\u201cOver 140,000 Minnesotans live in mixed status families of some form. As currently written, many Minnesotans who are in this country legally or part of a mixed status family will not receive any stimulus money, even if one of them has a social security number but the other does not,\u201d she explained:Per the release:The CARES Act provides a one-time stimulus payment of $1200 for most adults and $500 for children under the age of 17. In order to receive payment, the CARES Act requires identification in the form of a Social Security Number (SSN). Under current statute, married couples filing jointly with any non-SSN identification will not be eligible for the stimulus payment.\u2026The Recovery Rebates Improvement Act will expand the eligibility requirement to ensure joint tax filers with one SSN will receive payment and provide more people with vital economic assistance. Comprehensive legislation is needed in the next package to ensure that all noncitizens, whether holding a SSN or not, can access these relief payments.She also sent a letter to the Department of Treasury, urging it to address the eligibility requirements to \u201cclarify how certain taxpayers and dependents can actually receive these payments.\u201dThree House Democrats, Reps. Lou Correa (CA), Judy Chu (CA), and Ra\u00fal Grijalva (AZ), introduced a measure to amend the CARES Act, extending the cash benefits to ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers) taxpayers, which includes those residing the country illegally.\u201cThe Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act amends the CAREs Act to ensure that all taxpayers are eligible for their $1,200 relief check,\u201d the releasestates, adding that \u201cevery individual taxpayer irrespective of citizenship status should receive government assistance.\u201d\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOnly in the form of one way plane tickets out of the country.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

I think Mike Barnicle, a moment ago, listed the countries, almost 20 countries or more. I mean, most of the countries dealing with this crisis at a high level are doing better than the United States of America on testing. And the truth is, you cannot get us back to real normal. You cannot get the economy churning at the rate it wants to and needs to unless American citizens have confidence when they come back to the workplace. And they won\u2019t today.\u201dHe continued, \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re not going to fill restaurants, and you\u2019re not going to get people out there when the medical experts are saying, you know, it\u2019s not safe to do it yet. And the president is not heeding that. He\u2019s not leading. The fact that he\u2019s attacking governors, he\u2019s attacking members of the media. I mean, these rallies that he has on TV may appeal to his base, but watching a president of the United States engage in such extraordinary behavior in direct insults to people who are just calmly sitting there asking a question is stunning. \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen any president, Republican or Democrat alike behave like that. So, it may be entertaining as a reality show, but it has no relationship whatsoever to presidential leadership. And that\u2019s what Americans are judging now to a greater degree.\u201dFollow Trent Baker on Twitter@MagnifiTrent\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSooner or later we'll see this opportunistic ass wearing a wig trying to be Biden's VP pick.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

A lot of my callers bring that up and I see a lot of that discussion in social media.DAVID CAY JOHNSTON:There\u2019s no legal way for him to do that. We held an election in 1864 during the Civil War and we held an election in 1920, when the previous pandemic that killed Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather, was underway. If we can hold elections under those circumstances, if we can hold one in 1944, then yes, we of course are going to hold an election. I think what\u2019s more likely is severe efforts to deny the franchise to turn people away at the polls to do what they did in Dodge City, Kansas, which has a majority Latino population, they moved the voting to a location outside the city limits more than a mile from the nearest bus stop to suppress the Latino vote.[\u2026]We\u2019ve got to get this man out of office or it\u2019s the end of our democracy, and down that road, Joe, lie firing squads.MADISON:Firing squads?JOHNSTON:Well, that\u2019s what dictators do. I mean, I have no, you know, I said after Donald Trump won the electoral college, that if he could find a way to have me arrested, cause he said he hates me more than any other journalist in the world, that he would do so. And that Trump, who has no empathy for anyone else, all of us are just objects, Joe, we\u2019re not people.

But he challenged his termination \u201cwith union backing\u201d and secured an \u201carbitration ruling\u201d that says, \u201cBSO violated [his] constitutional due process rights and improperly terminated him.\u201dMiller is being rehired and will receive back pay.Seventeen people were killed in the Parkland shooting by an attacker who acquired his gun via a background check.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Not the players. We never saw a cut. Well, allegedly one player did.\u201dView this post on InstagramPlease read to understand my true feelings.  Today I got released by the NY Mets organization. The people on the other end of the phone had nothing but good things to say and I appreciated that very much. Anyone that has seen me play and compete knows that I lay it all on the line no matter what. Every practice, every game. I am a competitor, a true warrior. It\u2019s in my DNA. From the outside looking in, my baseball career probably raises a lot of questions. Why did you retire and come back? How come your numbers aren\u2019t very good if you were that dedicated? I have always kept my opinions to myself out of respect for the organization I signed a contract with. But now that it\u2019s officially over with them I\u2019d like to say some things.  One of the main reasons I retired was to keep myself from expressing how I felt. I was bitter, frustrated, and angry at the Mets organization. I felt my competitive nature was being taken advantage of. They knew I would never say no to competing and would fly me around to fill in for anyone that got injured. I realized this wasn\u2019t in my best interest when my delayed flight finally landed in the 3rd inning, and I was on the mound in a AAA baseball game for the first time, without any warm up throws. My UCL originally tore that night. Instead of seeing a doctors like I asked, they sent me back to High A to pitch in the playoffs. When I told them I couldn\u2019t I was made out to be the bad guy.  Then the next year, they made a mockery of our team by putting a celebrity on it to sell more tickets. I saw players lose their jobs because of it. We weren\u2019t playing to win, we were playing to make everyone else money. Not the players. We never saw a cut. Well, allegedly that one player did. I think people are starting to understand that more now but they didn\u2019t in 2018 when it was happening again. I was fed up. I spent my whole childhood honing in my passion and anger, to not let it get out of control, but it was and I was going to explode. So I took the opposite direction, I bottled it and silenced myself. I took some time away and cleared my head. Continued in comments..A post shared byAndrew Church(@papachurch36) onMay 28, 2020 at 6:29pm PDTThough Church never mentions Tebow by name, a careful reading of the minor league rosters reveals no other \u201ccelebrity\u201d that could have sparked ticket sales.The Mets, however, have been transparent about their reasons for signing Tebow. Former Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson admitted that Tebow\u2019s \u201ccelebrity\u201d factored into their decision to sign him.\u201cLook, we signed him because he is a good guy, partly because of his celebrity, partly because this is an entertainment business,\u201d AldersontoldNewsday.Regardless of the reasons for prompting Tebow\u2019s signing, his time with the Mets has been largely an unproductive disappointment. In four seasons playing at all levels of the minor leagues, Tebow ishittinga paltry .223 with 18 homeruns.Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter@themightygwinn\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAndrew who?

They have donated to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which the foundation claims will work to pay for and distribute doses of the vaccine to countries of low-income.Bill Gates commented on a few prospective vaccines, which are made by\u00a0Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a prominent supporter of the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement, is introducing legislation that would require federal law enforcement officers to identify their agency, last name, and identification number while on duty.\u201cThe United States of America should not have secret police,\u201d the New York lawmaker said.\u201cFederal law enforcement officers should have their identifying information displayed while on duty,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is basic\u201d:Ocasio-Cortez will be introducing the legislation this week titled \u201cLaw Enforcement Identification Transparency Act of 2020\u201d\u00a0with Washington, DC, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D).Under the legislation, the last name, agency, and badge number of on-duty federal law enforcement officers will need to be visible. The measure gives agencies 90 days from the enactment of the proposal to make the changes.The billstatesin part:Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section the head of each Federal law enforcement agency shall implement a policy requiring that a Federal law enforcement officer (in uniform or plain clothes), employed by a Federal law enforcement agency, make visible the following identification while on-duty or serving the public as a federal law enforcement officer.\u2026The Inspector General of the Department of Justice shall conductaudits to ensure compliance with the policy and data collection requirements pursuant to subsection (a), and shall,on an annual basis, report the findings of such audits tothe Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate.The proposal coincides with federal law enforcement presence in progressive cities overrun by violence and unrest in recent days. The situation in Portland, which has seen violent protests for several weeks, came to the national spotlight following last week\u2019s reports of federal authoritiesdetainingprotesters in unmarked police vehicles. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) spoke out against the alleged practice on Monday.\u201cWe cannot give up liberty for security. Local law enforcement can and should be handling these situations in our cities, but there is no place for federal troops or unidentified federal agents rounding people up at will,\u201d Paul stated:President Trump on Monday promised more federal law enforcement presence in Democrat-run cities\u201cI\u2019m going to do something \u2014 that, I can tell you,\u201d hesaid. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not going to let New York and Chicago and Philadelphia and Detroit and Baltimore and all of these \u2014 Oakland is a mess.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this happen in our country. All run by liberal Democrats,\u201d he continued, promising \u201cmore federal law enforcement.\u201d\u201cThese are anarchists. These are not protestors. People say \u2018protestors\u2019; these people are anarchists,\u201d he said, referencing the activists in Portland. \u201cThese are people that hate our country. And we\u2019re not going to let it go forward.\u201dThe president mused that many of the governors, mayors, and senators are \u201cafraid of these people\u201d \u2014 a possible explanation for their lack of force.\u201cThat\u2019s the reason they don\u2019t want us to help them. They\u2019re afraid. I really believe they\u2019re actually maybe even physically afraid of these people \u2014 because what they\u2019re doing is incredible,\u201d he added.Six Democrat mayors have sincesigneda letter to Attorney General William Barr and Acting Secretary Chad Wolf demanding \u201cimmediate action to withdraw\u201d federal forces.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSomeone take her crayons away.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

It has removed the ad and apologized.The original ad starring Boyega, 28, aired last year and was called \u201cThe London Gent.\u201d It features the London-born actor walking around the neighborhood where he grew up and riding a horse in a park, and it makes reference to his Nigerian heritage in a scene featuring West African attire.\u201cThe film celebrated my personal story\u2013 showcasing my hometown, including my friends and featuring my family,\u201d Boyega wrote. \u201cWhile many brands understandably use a variety of global and local ambassadors, dismissively trading out one\u2019s culture this way is not something I can condone.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time Boyega has been deleted from a China-based ad. He played a leading role as Finn in 2015\u2032s \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d but he and other nonwhite characters were removed or diminished from a Chinese poster for the movie.Boyega recently told GQ that Black characters have been \u201cpushed to the side\u201d in Disney\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. In June, the star made an emotional speech on racism when he joined Black Lives Matter protests in London.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5071999910\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nComing to Africa soon.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said Saturday that Republicans \u201cshould hold the same position\u201d they did in 2016 to decide who should fill the Supreme Court vacancy.Flake\u2019s comments came in a tweet in the days following the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who served for more than 25 years as a left-leaning member on the court.\u201cIn 2016, nine months before an election, we Republicans said that the next president should fill a Supreme Court vacancy,\u201d Flake wrote.Flake also stated that \u201cpreserving\u00a0the institution of the Senate\u201d by waiting until the presidential election concludes is \u201cparamount to any political gain.\u201d\u201cToday, six weeks before an election, we should hold the same position,\u201d Flake added. \u201cPreserving the institution of the Senate should be paramount to any political gain.\u201dBoth President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have stated that they plan to move forward quickly with finding a replacement for Ginsburg\u2019s seat.In 2016, Senate Republicans did not hold a vote for former President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland due to it being an election year.Other GOP senators who have recommended similar proposals of waiting until the presidential election is over to fill the seat include Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\u201cGiven the proximity of the presidential election\u00a0\u2026 I do not believe that the Senate should vote on the nominee prior to the election,\u201d Collinssaidin a statement. \u201cIn fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the President who is elected on November 3rd.\u201dIn a statement released over the weekend, Murkowski said her previous \u201cposition has not changed\u201d and that she feels \u201cthe same standard must apply\u201d to fill the vacancy as it did in 2016.\u201cI did not support taking up a nomination eight months before the 2016 election to fill the vacancy created by the passing of Justice Scalia,\u201d Murkowskisaid.\u201cWe are now even closer to the 2020 election, less than two months out, and I believe the same standard must apply,\u201d Murkowskiadded.Follow Kyle on Twitter@RealKyleMorrisandFacebook.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhy is a \"former Senator\" relevant?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Bell worked at Texas High School in Texarkana between August 5, 2019, and May 22, 2020, as an instructional aide and library assistant.Police began looking into Bell after a teacher overheard a group of boys speaking about how one of them may have gotten the aide pregnant.When the teacher confronted one of the 17-year-old students, he allegedly responded that Bell \u201ctold him he was not the daddy.\u201dAll of the alleged sexual encounters took place at Bell\u2019s New Boston, Texas, residence, so that city\u2019s police department conducted the investigation.The first victim told the police he had sex with Bell at her residence over Thanksgiving break last November. A second victim said he also had sex with her in the fall.He said he saw Bell outside of school because she was tutoring him, and on the third time he visited Bell\u2019s home, they had sex.The third victim, who was 16-years-old, knew Bell because she worked in the library. He allegedly said the two had communicated outside of school via Snapchat.He told the police that on November 22, he \u201cjokingly told Bell he was coming to see her.\u201d Later that night, Bell allegedly sent a Snapchat message asking him if he was coming to her house.Bell allegedly had her child in a car seat when she picked up the 16-year-old from his home and drove him to her home. The third boy also told the police she picked him up for sex the weekend after the first affair.PolicearrestedBell in late June on charges of improper relationship between an educator and a student for the 17-year-old boys and sexual assault of a child for the 16-year-old boy.Each offense is a second-degree felony, and she could face two to 20 years in prison for each count,Texarkana Todayreported.Bell is free on a $150,000 bond.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5105663625\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nCreating more victims for the Dim machine.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Rioters broke pipes in the ceiling, flooding the store.Fox29 reporter Steve Keeley tweeted video from inside the pillaged Walmart early Wednesday morning. The footage shows the devastation left behind by looters who stole everything from big-screen televisions to small appliances. Water is seen spraying from pipes in the ceiling.Looters trashed the store, knocking merchandise off the shelves. Keeley said vandals were still taking merchandise while he filmed the damage.Earlier, hundreds of people invaded the store and could be seen attempting to load multiple big-screen televisions into or onto vehicles.The unrest began after two officers shot and killed an armed Black man, Walter Wallace, Jr. Video captured by a witness shows Wallace advancing on two police officers around a car and into the street. Officers ordered Wallace repeatedly to drop the knife.Wallace continued approaching the retreating officers with the knife extended toward the police. Multiple shots rang out and Wallace fell to the ground. A responding police officer loaded Wallace into a vehicle and drove him to the hospital. He later died from his wounds.Bob Priceserves as associate editor and senior news contributor for theBreitbart Texas-Border team. He is an original member of the Breitbart Texas team.

That means Trump persuaded one in every 16 married women to flip from Clinton to Trump in 2020, despite media uproar about Trump\u2019s tweets and comments.Trump\u2019s gain was likely driven by Trump\u2019s good economy, which boosted household income by roughly 7 percent in 2019. Marriage tends to expand women\u2019s political concerns to include the economic interests of their male husbands.However, married women comprise just 26 percent of the 2020 electorate, so Trump\u2019s 13-point advantage was overwhelmed by Biden\u2019s twice-as-large 25-point advantage among the unmarried women who comprise a similar-sized share of the electorate.Yet Biden\u2019s share of the unmarried women\u2019s vote was just 62 percent, down one compared to Clinton\u2019s 63 percent share in 2016.The share of married women has been falling for decades, from roughly 65 percent in 1960 to 55 percent in 2000, down to roughly 50 percent in 2020.\u00a0The GOP has done little to offset this trend, aside from nudging up child-support payments in periodic tax bills.The 2020 poll showed a much smaller gap among women with or without children, partly because unmarried women with children are more likely to vote for the Democrats\u2019 promise of more federal aid.So the exit poll showed that 52 percent of women with children sided with Biden (Trump got 46 percent), and while 53 percent of women without children also sided with Biden (46 percent voted for Trump).The exit poll data comes from anexit surveyfunded by multiple media outlets. According to CNN, the exit polls \u201care a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and telephone polls measuring the views of absentee by-mail and early voters, and were conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 115 polling locations nationwide among 7,774 Election Day voters.

One of the complainants stated that they told the male subject to stop. However, the subject jumped into the driver seat and sped off in the vehicle with the rear door still open.A witness was able to identify the license plate number, enabling the police to run the license plate and obtain information on the owner of the vehicle, theCitizenreported.After police ran the license plate number, they found out the vehicle belonged to the victim\u2019s mother. Burdett said the woman told investigators she might know the man who snatched her baby but did not provide a name.Farmer-Crane was detained in another county for an unrelated crime, WSB-TVreported.It is unclear whether Farmer-Crane is the baby\u2019s father or if the mother or the baby was hurt in the incident.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5179119921\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYeah, they did such a good job in Africa.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Trump has perpetrated violence on hundreds of millions of people. My hope is (and this is the first time in my life) that the tables are turned and he is the victim of perpetrators,\u201d theWill & Gracestar wrote.Twitter didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from Breitbart News. Messing\u2019s tweet appears to violate Twitter\u2019s terms of service forbidding threats of violence and inciting others to abuse or harassment.Last week, Messing tweeted that she hopes President Trump ends up in jail where he will become the \u201cmost popular boyfriend\u201d among the inmates. The tweet received online blowback for its homophobic subtext, which the actress denied, saying that she is an \u201cLGBTQIA\u201d ally.Debra Messing wasone of Hollywood\u2019s most vocal Joe Biden supporters,participating in virtual fundraisersfor the Democratic candidate and regularly praising him on social media.The actress is a past Twitter offender.\u00a0In June, she got hit with a Twitter fact check afterBreitbart News reported that she posted a fake photoin an attempt to conflate President Trump and Adolf Hitler. The tweet was later removed from her account.In September, shecalled the president a \u201crapist\u201d and a \u201cpedophile\u201don Twitter but this time received no fact-check from the social media platform.Follow David Ng on Twitter@HeyItsDavidNg.

Such violations can lead to fines and even a suspension, MacMahon noted.Still, some claim that the video is older and not from the previous weekend at all. Presumably, that is why neither the team nor the league has officially spoken out about the incident.Regardless, Harden has made no bones about the fact that he wants to be traded away from Houston. He has been especiallyupsetthat Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta had been a supporter of President Donald Trump.Harden has also been acting out of late, making it look like he is trying to force the team to dump him off on someone else. He missed the Rockets\u2019 camp opening day and went to a rapper\u2019s birthday party at a strip club instead. It was also alleged that he had \u201cverbal confrontations\u201d during practice and threw a ball at a teammate.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at:facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBlack Sports Online??

You know, they stormed the Capitol and threatened to kill the vice president and put the lives of people in danger. and he had a huge part, a huge role to play in that.\u201dTapper said, \u201cAnd I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand how close this was to a mass casualty event with members of Congress and the vice president slaughtered. How worried are you about what might happen over the next ten days with President Trump remaining in office?\u201dHogan replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty worried, but we\u2019re taking action. You know, on the lead-in, you were talking about us sending in the national guard. Within minutes of this attack, I called a security team together, sent in several hundred specially-trained Maryland state police, a rapid response team, and I called up 500 members of the National Guard. We are having security briefings.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter@pamkeyNEN\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5221498291\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYeah, he got those jobs all on his own.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Given the vote results to defy the order, however, they indicated they will delay the start of in-school learning until Wednesday \u201cto ensure we have the time needed to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.\u201dThe union, however, said it made no such agreement with CPS:A message from Chicago Public Schools this afternoon, claiming that \u201cwe have agreed to a request from CTU leadership to push back the return of K-8 teachers and staff to Wednesday, Jan. 27,\u201d and seeking to sow dissent and disrupt collective Union action, is inaccurate.CPS unilaterally made the decision to move the return date for K-8 teachers back to Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021. The Union currently has no agreement with the district on any terms.\u201cThe overwhelming majority of our members have chosen safety, unity and solidarity, and an agreement is within reach, but we need a willing partner,\u201d CTU President Jesse Sharkey said. \u201cEmails like that don\u2019t help.\u201d\u201cOur collective power is our greatest strength,\u201d Sharkey added, \u201cand this vote cements our intention to continue to stand together in unity to land an agreement that protects educators, students and all of our CPS families.\u201dThe union\u2019s statement insisted that Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the school district make \u201csubstantive changes in remote learning to adequately provide for the clear majority of our students.\u201d\u201cWe need to frontload the needs of our Black and Brown children, because our district has failed them for far too long,\u201d CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates said. \u201cFrom 50 school closings, to only four school libraries on the West Side, to the loss of Black educators, to underfunded and under resourced bilingual education\u2026our district has failed them at every turn.\u201dTheSun Timesreport noted the strategy of union bosses has been \u201cto back CPS officials into a corner in negotiations by forcing the district to address teachers\u2019 concerns immediately, delay its reopening plan or risk halting all classes.\u201dHalf of all CPS teachers who were ordered to return to in-person instruction did not show up January 4.CPS CEO Dr. Janice Jacksonsaidthe teachers were \u201cpressured\u201d to stay out by the union.On January 10, the unionannounceda mobilization effort by \u201cparents, neighborhood residents,\u201d and teachers against what it called a \u201cdangerous\u201d plan to reopen CPS for in-person instruction.The union said \u201cover 50 Chicago neighborhoods\u201d are showing \u201cdouble digit positivity\u201d for the COVID-19 virus, with teachers reporting \u201cserious safety failures at schools.\u201dAdditionally, CTU stated, \u201cBlack and Brown parents continue to reject in-person learning.\u201dJacksonannounced, nevertheless, that teachers who failed to show up for work would not be paid.\u201cWe know that a small portion of staff members may choose not to return,\u201d she said, according to NBC5 Chicago. \u201cThose individuals will be deemed absent without leave, and they will not be eligible for pay going forward.\u201d\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve done every single thing within our power to ensure a safe return to school in this situation,\u201d she added.CPS officials noted the school board has invested $100 million in virus-related safety, including PPE, air purifiers, and additional custodial staff.In December, Local 1 of the CTUdeletedits tweet that stated, \u201cThe push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism and misogyny.\u201dCrain\u2019s Chicago BusinessreportedFriday the Biden administration\u2019s goal of reopening the nation\u2019s public schools for in-person learning \u201crisks reigniting union tension\u201d with a solid portion of the Democrat Party base.According to the report, about 43 percent of students in the U.S. are learning remotely, and more than one-third have not been in school since the pandemic began.A report released in December by the Association of Christian Schools International, however,showedthat 90 percent of Christian schools opened the 2020-2021 academic year with in-person instruction as planned, despite the pandemic.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nReplace them with ai.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    -

(Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney)TheHurt Lockeractor\u00a0is not just frustrated that he thinks he has been overlooked. Mackie feels it is a societal problem for all black men in America.In the very woke Disney series, Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson frets about taking on the mantle of Captain America left to him when Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) gave up his shield in the last of theAvengersmovies, 2019\u2019sAvengers: Endgame.One of the themes the Disney streaming series explores is whether a black man can be accepted in America as a hero at all, much less its titular champion Captain America. And Mackie sees his own life and experience as a black man in the question posed onscreen.\u201cThe fear of representing a country who doesn\u2019t represent you, you know, was something that\u2019s not only unfathomable but hard to overcome,\u201d Mackie told the paper. \u201cMy dad always used to say greatness is as far as you can see it\u2026 There are limitations that we place on ourselves because of our surroundings. And, you know, I did that to myself, and that\u2019s definitely what Sam Wilson goes through.\u201dAnthony Mackie also recentlyadmittedthat he wanted to put an anti-Trump gibe in his final woke monologue on the state of the world and its heroes but the idea was shot down by series producers. Still, there were plenty of other woke moments in the series.In one scene, Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson was turned down for a loan by a bank officer, a scene that the series showrunner, Malcolm Spellman,saidwas meant to highlight the real-life experiences of blacks in the U.S. today.In another scene, Sam Wilson discovers that the U.S. government lied to him and led him to believe he would take over as the new Captain America. Instead, the government gave the role to a white soldier.Spellman also noted that the producers specifically aimed to hire only black writers for the series to focus on race issues on the Disney show.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at:facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMight hold water if he could point to a country where black men have reached their \"potential\" more than in the U.S.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The Oscar-winner said he\u2019s still \u201cmeasuring\u201d a possible gubernatorial run in Texas.When\u00a0Swisher brought up the recently enacted legislation in Texas \u2014 which bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, once a fetal heartbeat is detected \u2014 McConaughey said he had \u201ca problem\u201d with the law.McConaughey \u2014 who\u00a0said he has been trying to not let anyone know his political stances, as he mulls over entering politics \u2014 said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to come out and tell you right now, on this show, where I stand on abortion,\u201d but ultimately called the pro-life law \u201cjuvenile.\u201d\u201cThis latest move by Texas,\u201d theTrue Detectivestar\u00a0said, feels like \u201csort of a\u00a0Roe v.

In the clip, the failed presidential candidate said the following:[McConaughey]\u2019s a really popular figure whose political views have not in any way been fixed. I don\u2019t know \u2014 for example \u2014 who he voted for in the most consequential election since 1864 in this country. I don\u2019t know how he feels about any of the issues that we brought up \u2014 he\u2019s a good guy who has done some good work in this state, and he\u2019s a great actor.While\u00a0Swisher said she believes\u00a0O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments were \u201cshade,\u201d\u00a0McConaughey said he didn\u2019t feel the same way, and went on to praise the former Texas representative, who he says \u201cbelieves in what he\u2019s selling.\u201d\u201cComing from Beto, I don\u2019t take that as shade,\u201d Matthew McConaughey reacted. \u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s a good man.

At first, he fell and appeared to drop his phone.\u201cDe La Cruz, who was wearing a backpack, then stumbles back briefly before repeatedly trying to hop over another turnstile.\u00a0On the final attempt, De La Cruz can be seen hoisting himself up \u2014 but losing his balance and flipping over the barrier,\u201d thePostreport said.He fell on his head, breaking his neck, according to authorities.The end of the clip showed his body lying still on the floor.De La Cruz was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident, police noted, adding the victim was \u201cattempting to evade the fare\u201d when the incident occurred.According to Fox News, in 2018 the penalty forhoppinga turnstile meant a civil citation, and the accused would either face a $100 fine or challenge the case in the Transit Adjudication Bureau.\u201cIn 2017, of 33,000 turnstile jumpers in Manhattan, 25,000 got summonses and 8,000 were arrested,\u201d the report said.Meanwhile, citizens werereturningto the New York City subway in large numbers, and recent statistics showed a rise in subway crime, CBS New York reported December 13:During November, statistics show the daily robbery average underground increased from 1.3 to 2.9. The daily major felony average rose from 3.8 to 7.8.\u00a0There were 88 robberies in the system in Nov. 2021, compared to 39 in Nov. 2020.\u00a0From January-November, felony assaults were up, but robberies were actually down from last year: 466 in 2021 compared to 534 in 2020.The total number of major felonies, including assault, rape, murder, robbery and burglary, are down. From January-November 2021, it was 1,581. For 2020, it was 1,626. Pre-pandemic, in 2019, it was 2,227.\u00a0Hate crimes in the transit system are up 79%.\u201cI think it\u2019s getting worse.

Now, nearly five years later,\u00a0Griffin wants to get back on the D-list.\u201cI just want to get back to making people laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cMore than anything else, that\u2019s what has been robbed from me.\u201d(Rich Polk/Getty Images for Politicon)Griffin also revealed that she had taken \u201ca bunch of pills,\u201d telling the New York Times of an apparent suicide attempt that sent her to the hospital in June 2020.\u201cI wrote a note to Randy and then I took a bunch of pills, and I just thought I would go to sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cI really thought he\u2019d be better off without me, that the world would be.\u201dGriffin also blames the patriarchy for why she\u2019s having trouble getting back on the D-list, claiming that there is a double standard, as CNNrehiredJeffrey Toobin several months after he was\u00a0caught masturbating during a Zoom call with his formerNew Yorkercolleagues.\u201cWhen you\u2019re an artist known for being \u2018difficult\u2019 and you\u2019re a man, they write New Yorker profiles about you and then Aaron Sorkin writes an open letter in support,\u201d Griffin said.\u00a0\u201cBut when you\u2019re \u2018difficult\u2019 and you\u2019re a woman, they call you a pain in the (expletive).\u201dGriffin also compared her bloody Trump photoshoot to\u00a0Andy Cohen\u2019srecent commentsabout then-outgoing New York City mayor Bill\u00a0de Blasio (D) on CNN\u2019s\u00a0New Year\u2019s Eve show, in which he said\u00a0de Blasio had done \u201cfour years of the crappiest term,\u201d adding, \u201csayonara, sucker.\u201dCNN stood by Cohen, which Griffin found irritating.\u201cApples to apples,\u201d she said, claiming that Cohen had made a political statement, just as she had.Others might argue, however, that saying a politicians did a \u201ccrappy\u201d job before adding, \u201csayonara, sucker\u201d is different than posing with a bloody severed head of a sitting president.Moreover, perhaps it\u2019s not the patriarchy holding her back, but the reality that\u00a0Griffin can be difficult to work with.\u201c\u200b\u200bI honestly never had a desire to make enemies,\u201d Griffin insisted. \u201cBut I keep making enemies.\u201dGriffin also recalled a time in 2016, ten days before the New Year\u2019s Eve show, when she contacted CNN president Jeff Zucker, telling him that she was doing more work than\u00a0Anderson Cooper and wanted a raise. Zucker \u201cgot very offended,\u201d she said.\u201cHe started yelling at me and he literally said something like, \u2018Who do you think you are calling here demanding a raise?\u2019 And then something came over me. And I just lost it. I just started screaming. I\u2019m Kathy [beep!] Griffin, Jeff, that\u2019s who I am,\u201d Griffin toldthe New York Times.After that,\u00a0Zucker\u00a0fired her. But later, when Griffin called CNN president begging him to take her back, he rehired her, but with a 20 percent pay cut.You can follow Alana\u00a0Mastrangelo onFacebookand Twitter at@ARmastrangelo, and onInstagram.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI thought she died.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022God\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022California\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Jesus\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

President Joe Biden declared that his first nominee would be a black woman, thereby invoking the kind of discrimination that the Supreme Court itself has said is unconstitutional.There are pendingcasesabout racial discrimination that Judge Jackson would hear as a Supreme Court justice, and therefore it is important to investigate her views on these topics closely.The topic of Judge Jackson\u2019s lecture in Michigan was certainly acceptable: \u201cBlack Women Leaders in the Civil Rights Movement Era and Beyond.\u201dThe general thrust of her remarks, delivered in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, was that black women have often led the fight for equal rights in the United States \u2014 the fight to ensure the nation was faithful to its founding principles. Through those black women, all other Americans became more free. That is certainly true.What is alarming is that Judge Jackson cited Critical Race Theory, and its founder, Derrick Bell, as a source of inspiration. Bell\u2019s basic thesis was that America is fundamentally racist, and that racism is enshrined in all of our institutions, since the Constitution was drafted at a time when black people could be owned as slaves.To Bell, only the adoption of socioeconomic rights, through which the state would radically redistribute private wealth, could America be saved from systemic racism.In his bookFaces at the Bottom of the Well,which Judge Jackson said was omnipresent in her home as she grew up, Bell claimed that America is so racist that we would sell our black citizens to space aliens for gold to pay off our national debt.Judge Jackson also cited theNew York Times\u2019\u201c1619 Project,\u201d whose opening essay by Nikole Hannah-Jonesfalselyclaimed that the American Revolution was fought to preserve slavery, making slavery the founding principle of the United States.Furthermore, Judge Jackson said that her\u00a0\u201cfavorite civil rights photograph of modern times\u201d was that of a Black Lives Matter protester being arrested by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2016, at a march to express outrage against the shootings, by police, of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.As striking as the image may be, the protest itself was misguided: both men were allegedly armed when they were shot. The Black Lives Matter movement would go on to devastate cities nationwide.If these are Judge Jackson\u2019s influences, she has no place on the Supreme Court. We cannot have a Justice who believes the Constitution is racist; who believes America was founded on slavery; or who believes police are guilty until proven innocent.Judge Jackson\u2019s confirmation is being treated as a foregone conclusion. But she cannot simply sail through the process: she must face specific questions about her beliefs.Does she share Derrick Bell\u2019s view that the Constitution is racist? Does she share the 1619 Project\u2019s view on the American Revolution? Does she believe the officers who shot Sterling and Castile are guilty of murder? And \u2014 crucially \u2014 does she believe the race and gender criteria of her own nomination are acceptable?These are not idle questions: they go directly to the question of whether Judge Jackson can be impartial on cases involving civil rights.When President Donald Trump nominated prosecutor Ryan Bounds to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2017, there were several Senators \u2014 including Republicans Marco Rubio (FL) and Tim Scott (SC) \u2014 whospoke outagainst Bounds\u2019s writings as a college student, more than 20 years before. These essays, falsely described as \u201cracist,\u201d mocked identity politics and political correctness. Bounds apologized for using strident language; it was not enough to salvage his nomination.Nothing he wrote comes anywherecloseto the racial extremism of Judge Jackson\u2019s role models.There cannot be a double standard on civil rights. If a Republican nominee had to withdraw because of skepticism of racial politics as a student, a Democratic nominee with radical racial views in the present day should not be on the Supreme Court.Joel B.
