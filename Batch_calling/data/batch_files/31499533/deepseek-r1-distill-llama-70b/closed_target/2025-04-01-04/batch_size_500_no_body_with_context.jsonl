The result is the disastrous migration of children from the third world Latin American countries that increases each day Washington does nothing. I have never seen our government become so ineffective and lawless that their only response is to pass amnesty? We have laws and they need to be enforced.

There are so many welfare programs that an illegal can sign up for that these illegals are well taken care of in this state than the Veterans. The illegals are bold and arrogant because they know that they are protected by the media and the politicians!!!

These youths are coming here for 0bama's de facto amnesty, they are coming here because the regime in power will treat them better than American citizens, even our own veterans, not for free teddy bears and soccer balls (donated by the private sector, btw).\n\nTheir folks shouldn't have sent them here. The tyrant occupying our White House lured them here to be exploited as political props to push his anti-American agenda, to intensify the progressive globalists' economic and cultural warfare against America that is collapsing our economy,destroying our currency and overwhelming our welfare state.\n\nSo go ahead, hand the kids a teddy bear, the older ones a soccer ball, and then a plane ticket to send them back home.\n\n<b>*<u>UPDATE 3/21/16</u>*\nTo all you people replying to me in March of 2016- Get a grip, people, this post is <u>two years old</u>-  Beck handing teddy bears to little kids and Cruz handing out medical supplies has done nothing- absolutely nothing- to increase the number of third world replacements that Democrat and Republican Globalist rot-gut pukes are flooding our country with.\nThe globalists are destroying our country through open borders- I said that then and I said that now.  This post is about teddy bears.  Teddy bears.\nGet a grip and focus your rage on the globalist scumbag uniparty.  I look forward to building the wall and deporting the illegals.  \n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nBeck deserves every bit of the vitriol he has been getting.  We who have lived in Texas and are real Texans (unlike Beck) have suffered under illegal immigration for decades but no one cared because it was a \"border\" state problem.  Not until it started affecting them.  Now everyone is waking up.\nBut don't worry; Beck's kids won't have to go to school with the illegals running the risk of catching a communicable disease.  Beck won't have to worry about his house being broken into by illegals; he has armed guards.  His daughter will not get mugged outside of Home Depot.  He'll send his hired security guards to go with her.\n\nI don't need Glenn Beck preaching to me about how I'm supposed to do Christian acts.  If I want spiritual advise, I'll go to my own pastor, not Glenn Beck.\n\nOne other thing; Ted Cruz won the straw poll at the recent TxGOP convention.  If he starts pandering for the illegals, and doesn't stand firm against any amnesty by any name, his goose is cooked in Texas.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLyin' Ted is at it again!! Folks, this phony will never secure our borders, and will NEVER even try to build a wall. All he wants is to get elected.

Proud rich guy, unashamed of success in money or women, defense contractor to protect America, origin story and main villain involves Chinese commies.\n\nThe leftist hivemind went out of their way to corrupt him (and superheroes in general, since kids read them), and so he became an authoritarian cuck that gets slapped around by the true (leftist) heroes.  The leftist hacks that write these plots are so dumb though that Tony really does come across as just a Hillary fan and the leftist heroes all libertarians/anti-government.

Why would they want to import muslims if they support gays and women? Why would they want to bring in unlimited numbers of immigrants if they want to raise wages and protect the environment? These questions have a simple answer. They want more diversity and that means making America (and Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) less white.\n\nThere will not be a place for whites in Clinton's America unless they are billionaire donors who can afford to live safely in gated communities and look down on people of every race as nothing but cheap labor. Nonwhites who express support for the traditional American nation (Thomas Sowell, Judge Jeanine, and Clarence Thomas, for example) will be called race traitors and reviled for not supporting their race even as whites are called names if they do support their race.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAll religions except the Muslim religion.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Drugs\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022China\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala HarrisTaxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Vaccines\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"title": "Explanation", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Moore's propoganda film \"Sicko\" was about how horrible and unfair the best and most innovative health care system in the world was, at least before Obamacare that is, while extolling the virtues of Cuba's health care system because it was \"free\"..                                                                                           \n\nMoore's love affair with anything that is not American, capitalist, or freedom inspired, is legendary.. Next to Stone, I would place Moore as the number two commie loving scumbag hypocrite on this list... While a couple of \"celebrities\" listed are most likely just idiots, i.e. Chevy Chase, Moore revels in authoritarianism because he believes it's in the ignorant masses best Interest.. Moore seems to truly believe that people are incapable of self sufficiency, and that the world requires people who think like he does to takes care of their needs and to destroy those who oppose such a system, all based on compassion of course..  Dictator sycophants like Moore and Stone fantasize about being part of the inside intelligencea who whisper in the ear of communist despots...                      \n\nOliver Stone and Michael Moore have prospered under the very system they shlt on.. Both of them have been able to literally set their families up fianacially for generations by making a living trashing their own country and the capatalist system that made them wealthy... Ironically, while cashing in, these two have personally and through their movies, promoted an ideology that would have them executed for their greed and for shooting off their big mouths if they lived in the very countries that they love so much... THAT is the definition of hypocrisy!...                                             \n\nI would guess that right now Michael is curled up on his sofa, stuffing his face with Doritos and Ben and Jerry's, drowning his sorrows in gravy, and contemplating the magnitude of this loss.. Maybe Castro's death will be enough to bring on the long awaited chest grabber that Moore so richly deserves...\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nCommunism in Hollywood lives on!

PBS pays their president a $632,233 yearly salary. This is shocking but here\u2019s another one: Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received $956,513!\n\nFormer Senator Jim DeMint speaks up in the WSJ about the obscene salaries the higher ups at PBS and NPR are getting:\n\nWhen presidents of government-funded broadcasting are making more than the president of the United States, it\u2019s time to get the government out of public broadcasting.\n\nWhile executives at the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) are raking in massive salaries, the organizations are participating in an aggressive lobbying effort to prevent Congress from saving hundreds of millions of dollars each year by cutting their subsidies.\n\nThe so-called commercial free public airwaves have been filled with pleas for taxpayer cash. The Association of Public Television Stations has hired lobbyists to fight the cuts. Hundreds of taxpayer-supported TV, radio and Web outlets have partnered with an advocacy campaign to facilitate emails and phone calls to Capitol Hill for the purpose of telling members of Congress, \u201cPublic broadcasting funding is too important to eliminate!\u201d\n\nPBS President Paula Kerger even recorded a personal television appeal that told viewers exactly how to contact members of Congress in order to \u201clet your representative know how you feel about the elimination of funding for public broadcasting.\u201d But if PBS can pay Ms. Kerger $632,233 in annual compensation\u2014as reported on the 990 tax forms all nonprofits are required to file\u2014surely it can operate without tax dollars\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, highly successful, brand-name public programs like Sesame Street make millions on their own. \u201cSesame Street,\u201d for example, made more than $211 million from toy and consumer product sales from 2003-2006. Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received $956,513 in compensation in 2008.

The term refugee was bandied about to such an extent that the *real* refugees, such as Christians and Yazidis who had much to fear from ISIS, didn't get the help from the west that they had every right to expect, and are still not getting it.\n\nSo when the mayor says that a tiny number of criminals have discredited 800 refugees living in his city, he's still lying.

More bombshells are to come. The Fusion GPS saga isn\u2019t over. The Clinton-DNC funding is but a first glimpse into the shady election doings concealed within that oppo-research firm\u2019s walls. We now know where Fusion got some of its cash, but the next question is how the firm used it. With whom did it work beyond former British spy Christopher Steele ? Whom did it pay? Who else was paying it? The answers are in Fusion\u2019s bank records. Fusion has doggedly refused to divulge the names of its clients for months now, despite extraordinary pressure.\n[\u2026]\nIf the House wins, don\u2019t be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s office. FBI bombshells are also yet to come.\n\n[\u2026]\nAssuming the FBI is comprehensive in its disclosure, expect to learn that the dossier was indeed a major basis of investigating the Trump team\u2014despite reading like \u201cthe National Enquirer,\u201d as Rep. Trey Gowdy aptly put it. We may learn the FBI knew the dossier was a bought-and-paid-for product of Candidate Clinton, but used it anyway. Or that it didn\u2019t know, which would be equally disturbing.\n\nhttp://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/paper-fusion-gps-bank-records-fbi-connection-trump-dossier-bombshells-come/\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nRussians will use the  Hillary uranium to wipe out America, you mean like with a cloth?\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIf there is someone I would seriously put the blame on, it would be the corrupt MSM. They have enabled the Clinton corruption as well as all the government corruption that went on during the Obama presidency. So invested in Obama(first black POTUS and Hillary, future first female President) that they abandoned all their journalistic responsibilities, the most important: making government officials accountable and exposing corruption. Good government is only possible when media exposes graft and corruption. The MSM has failed this nation and it's citizens.

The Polish haven't imported masses of the anti-semites recently, so why is this occurring? I don't think that it digs deep enough, and simply blaming the government because of this single law doesn't wash with me. There would have to be some deep seated anti-semitism going on; as if the Jews were being blamed by Poles for the invasion by the Nazis in 1939.\n\nI would hope that the situation isn't as dire as the article implies, but it is something that we should keep an eye on.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nLet's GOOGLE-IMAGE search.

This lot will use their righteous rage to not only steal from, rape, and then murder us, they will feel ennobled it pursuing their just cause.\n\nFrom National Socialist \u2018breathing space\u2019, to the Gulag Archipelago, Mao\u2019s Reeducation Camps, the Killing Fields, Rawanda, to ISIS... we see the results of such Leftist onslaughts... Nations murdering hundreds of millions of their own.\n\nLiberals have jumped the sarin, let\u2019s have them land in it before they dispense it upon us.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nTread lightly with this one.....Comparing the Jewish plight with that of the one south of the border could ruffle some heathens!!!\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThey are not only comparing this to the Holocaust but Laura Bush compared it to the Japanese  interment camps during WW2.

Ranches provided ample milk and meat. Coffee beans led the country in exports. People mostly worked on farms. With\nthe oil boom, Venezuelans were made dependent on imported food,\nessentially pushing out almost all sectors of the economy especially food \nproduction due to the flood of cheaper imports.When socialist Hugo \nChavez came to power, he ordered government price control on food and other basic goods that led to shortages. The cost of production became \nhigher than the selling price. Today Venezuela imports 80% of its food.\nBecause of Hugo's socialist agenda, his government confiscated vast\nagricultural land to be redistributed as part of land reform. Farmers and\nranchers have lost the security of producing due to the threat of govt. confiscation as well as lack of law and order where criminals were free to \nsteal livestock and are punished. Most of Venezuela's problems were brought about by the government's corruption and socialism as well as their citizens' acceptance of socialism and addiction to \"free stuff.\"\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Drugs\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022China\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala HarrisTaxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Vaccines\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"title": "Explanation", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

And YES, I am very thankful\nto America, the country I have chosen to be my home for the last 42 years and to God\nfor all his abundant blessings!!!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Drugs\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022China\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala HarrisTaxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Vaccines\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"title": "Explanation", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Every American should be very, very concerned. \nThe Marxist Democrats are experts at stealing elections. They've done it since after the civil \nwar when black Republicans won elections in the South. From 1877 to 1954, the south was \ntotally controlled by the Democrats through the use of intimidation, violence, fraud, poll taxes, \nrestrictive & arbitrary registration practices. The Democrats and their globalist masters want \ntotal control of America. If they win they will destroy or silence their enemies and that includes the GOP, the few conservatives in the media and corporate America and Pres.Trump's supporters.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Drugs\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022China\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala HarrisTaxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Vaccines\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"title": "Explanation", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}
