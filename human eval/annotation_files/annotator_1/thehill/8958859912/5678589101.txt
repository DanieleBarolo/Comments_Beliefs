It's been a big day for you lib squids, huh. while you all were ranting and raving about some vandalism, and listening to the alzheimer's patient. I was enjoying a beautiful day here in the free state of Florida.

Garland's speech yesterday and President Biden labelin' Trump as the undisputed leader of the #January6th attack sounds like a one-two punch kickin' off 2022 as the year of accountability for those who sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
