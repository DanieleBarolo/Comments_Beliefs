If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

  This comment is a fine example of the cartoon debate.

    There's nothing inherently evil about guns. To me, they're in the same category as fried cheese and fast cars. Even though they kill people above and beyond their expected utility, I can accept that the amount of joy they bring to people is worth keeping them around. And in light of the lead-crime hypothesis, I think it's worth rethinking the liberal consensus on how gun proliferation led to or even contributed to the crime waves of the 70s to late 90s.


However, what I despise is the fetishism about guns. We can't have an intelligent conversation about them the way we do about fireworks* because people go into hysterics just at the mention of restricting access. This engenders a sneering cynicism at so-called adults who can't look at a topic rationally.


*Where the verdict is, sure they can blind and cripple small children but they're cool so let's just minimize the damage.

Do you have cheese invented solely for the purpose of killing multiple people quickly, requiring so little skill that 2 year olds have successfully eliminated bothersome family members with it?


Grow up.

        Firearms were invented to propel a projectile from the end of a barrel. What that projectile hits is the responsibility of the one who pulled the trigger. 
There are close to 350million guns in the US, a statistically small number of those are used to kill or injure. Emotional argument.

          Seeing as your comment is posted below an article on the very real and statistical and fiscal arguments against lax gun laws. I would say that your comment is downright laughable.  And I'm not laughing with you....


Firearms were invented to kill people and other living things:  full stop.  They are not a tool, but a weapon.  That is definitional, and any comment to the opposite is pure rhetorical propaganda.

 But you're right: Guns don't kill people- idiotic gun owners do.  
I have no desire to regulate guns- I want to further regulate the people that sell them, buy them, use them, abuse them.


I could bury you in news stories showing showing absurd the NRA "all of us are responsible gun owners" propaganda trope is- but that would require some more reading comprehension on your part, and then where would we be?
