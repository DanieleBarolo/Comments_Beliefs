First of all, you're only going to bring weapons that you're going to use. Second, you're not going to be modifying guns to automatic fire in your hotel room the day before.
Let's use a little common sense.

Trump has been trying to help protect us from this and liberals have overuled him at every step.

The Sudanese immigrant who shot up a White Christian Church in Tennessee, now we see this horrific attack.

You liberal sanctuary city appeasers are to blame for this carnage!

The 9th Circuit should feel proud they stopped our President from protecting our homeland.

Sickening!!

Paddock did not act alone.
He simply could not have afforded an automatic weapon, either legally or illegally.
Somebody paid for this to happen.

Follow the money.
