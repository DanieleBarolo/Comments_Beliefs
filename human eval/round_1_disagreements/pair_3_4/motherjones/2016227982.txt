Yes, if they are intellectually honest, but they cannot be so they are shysters and expect people to compartmentalize their absurd claims. That's why they make contradictory assertions like those.

If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

PARENT COMMENT:
I have ask this question many times, " they say there is no reason to carry a gun, then say people are dangerous and too many are getting killed with guns. Wouldn't their argument be a good argument to carry a gun?

Huffpo has a story going about the two radical Islamist that were killed. Its amazing how nearly every lib on the thread blames the ones who were attacked and making excuses for the two attackers with GUNS. In short, for this story they are for guns and against free speech? Do they have a manual?

  The very same strategy they use to disparage Anyone who defends with firearms. They are trying to poison the whole concept of defense, National, public, and personal. Just their SOP for brainwashing the common man. Like Tokyo Rose did, and Mohamed Ali. 
Progressives think the North American is too aggressive for their Statist dreams. Of course, they're right. haha

    Notice how they paint concealed and open carriers as menacing violent criminals while they think real violent criminals just need compassion and rehabilitation.

      Right, when concealed carriers are arrested for crime at a lower rates then even police are, and shoot negligently at 1/5 the rate police do. hmmm, Notice also with 11 million permits issued, there are 10 armed law abiding citizens for every cop we see in our daily travels. It is not a rare phenomena. Yet still no problems with the policy at all, in 20 years.
But we are the violent and dangerous ones?
