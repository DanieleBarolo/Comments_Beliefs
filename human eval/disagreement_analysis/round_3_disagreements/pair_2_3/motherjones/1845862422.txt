So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.

PARENT COMMENT:
ACA is a tax, mandatory. And that in itself is immoral. What ever happened to freedom of choice?
