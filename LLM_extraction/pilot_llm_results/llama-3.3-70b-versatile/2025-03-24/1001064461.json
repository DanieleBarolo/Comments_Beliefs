  "article_body": "It would have been too much to ask for Hollywood to give the Reagans their due in the forthcoming movie \u201cThe Butler.\u201d You knew that going in. But either way, casting Jane Fonda in the role of Nancy Reagan was surely meant to push buttons, stir up controversy and generate interest in\u2013and hence, profits for\u2013the movie.This being the reality, let me then push some other buttons.The problem with casting Jane Fonda as former First Lady Nancy Reagan is not just that Fonda is nearly twenty years older right now than Mrs. Reagan was when she entered the White House in January of 1981, or that Fonda is at best a mediocre actress and that Nancy Davis was probably a better actress in her day.Or that the best thing about Jane Fonda the actress is her last name, or that in the looks department, Nancy Reagan had, and probably will always have, Fonda beat hands down.The problem goes far deeper than appearances. The very day Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, Jane Fonda was quoted as saying he was \u201ca lousy actor and he\u2019ll make a lousy president.\u201d Reagan reciprocated the minimal respect.Indeed, one would be hard pressed to think that Reagan would have approved of the casting of Fonda as his wife\u2013since in a letter he wrote to William F. Buckley during his presidency, he called Fonda and her then-second husband, Tom Hayden, \u201ctraitors to their country.\u201dReagan was being charitable. Fonda was not just a traitor to her country, she was also a traitor to humanity. \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d cheered on the North Vietnamese, and like many on the left in America, was pleased about the downfall of the pro-American South Vietnam government.As Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge came to power, springing from Cambodia (which the left went crazy over when Nixon bombed it) millions died at the hands of that murderous communist regime in the \u201ckilling fields\u201d and \u201creeducation camps.\u201d Were Fonda and her comrades happy about the extermination by communist thugs of innocent civilians? There is no evidence they supported the genocide\u2013but on the other hand, neither is there evidence they opposed it.Silence equaled death.And when the time came to show some compassion and help these people flee for their lives in hundreds of rickety boats, the American Left turned their backs on these helpless people because it didn\u2019t comport with their political views. Adrift in the South China Sea, the \u201cBoat People\u201d were easy prey for Thai pirates who committed heinous acts of rape, pillage and murder against the defenseless Boat People.George McGovern sniffed that Southeast Asian people should stay in Southeast Asia. Other liberals expressed similar indifference and Jimmy Carter, who had made human rights a theme of his presidency, dithered for a number of days before reluctantly allowing the Boat People into America.One liberal who did show mettle was Joan Baez, who held free concerts across America to raise money for the Boat People. Baez, a thinking woman\u2019s pacifist, didn\u2019t hate America; she hated war. Fonda, on the other hand, supported the war being waged by the North Vietnamese and by extension, the communists in China and Moscow, against the United States.Baez hated war, while Fonda reviled America. It doesn\u2019t get more black and white than that. Baez later took out full page ads in American newspapers denouncing the human rights violations in Vietnam.In response to Baez\u2019s compassion, Fonda wrote a letter to her denouncing Baez for trying to help the people fleeing communist oppression. \u201cYour actions only align you with the most narrow and negative elements in our country who continue to believe that Communism is worse than death.\u201d This was a long time ago but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true than \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d participated in propaganda broadcasts aimed at undermining the morale of US military personnel.There\u2019s ill irony, then, that she\u2019s now portraying Nancy Reagan. Fonda made a political cause of supporting the tormentors of the Vietnamese Boat People while Nancy Reagan and her husband were compassionately greeting these refugees in California as new Americans.Eventually, about 800,000 of the one million who fled Vietnam made it to America.Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan also greeted the American POWs\u2013along with Richard Nixon and Ross Perot\u2013kindly and warmly in California, as they were finally released. They both wept when told the stories of torture endured by the brave young American men. The young Americans\u2019 time in captivity might have gone a tad better without Jane Fonda egging their captors on.Diamonds and Rust indeed.There is no evidence that Jane Fonda did anything except cause misery in other peoples\u2019 lives when it comes to this difficult period of American history.Meanwhile someday someone will write a very good book about Nancy Reagan and what she meant to her husband and, by extension, America. It was said that if Reagan had wanted to be a shoe salesman, she would have made sure he was the best shoe salesman in America. It just so happened he wanted to be president. This country is fortunate for him and for her pushing him.She was tough in that White House and demanding on the political campaigns, but also kind and never gratuitously mean. Even today in retirement Mrs. Reagan still remembers birthdays and anniversaries, calls friends who have lost loved ones, and exhibits the class and style that she and President Reagan brought back to the White House.They say that behind every successful man there is a great woman. No one seems to know the origin of the phrase, but it certainly seems to have been true for George Washington, for Franklin D. Roosevelt and for Ronald Reagan.Mrs. Reagan doesn\u2019t need to be portrayed in the movies, of course\u2013although if it makes her happy, then mores the better. In any case, Nancy Reagan\u2019s place in American history is secure. She did very well on a much larger and more important stage than one Hollywood film\u2013whoever stars in it\u2013can offer her.",
