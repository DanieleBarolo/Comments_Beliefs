They initially did so in 2012, about 2 years after cap & trade failed and the House was lost. A reasonable time-frame to put together a rule. They  eventually then had to redo the rule because of legal worries (and if rule for new plants got vacated, that would leave any rule on existing in a precarious position.) The new rule was released in September 2013, but wasn't officially proposed until 2014.\n\nTo have the rule available as a quick hammer, they would have had to had the rule being worked on when cap & trade was still alive in the House.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n\"<I>..

I Retract My Defense of Optics.\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nAs Kevin's readers are aware, I'm no wordsmith--hence I won't comment on the lexicon issue. I can, however, report with confidence that the wingnuts aren't talking so much about the photograph anymore as they are instead nominating Bernadette (Bernadette Lancelin, the Houston woman Fox interviewed earlier this week, who delivered a profanity-laced rant to the camera about her opposition to helping the border children) for the GOP Presidential ticket in 2016.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI recall the initial outrage over Bush's response to Katrina being that he didn't even think any FEMA involvement would be needed at all until five days after the storm hit, while it was obvious in a day or two that it was a disaster. It was Republican ideology that made him think Louisiana should go it alone.\n\n\nThe flip side to the bizarre Presidential action meme is that, not only is there always something going on in the world, it seems to assume that if the President is not personally on the scene, then nothing is being done. Of course trying to portray Obama as a do-nothing President is a perfect fit with the racist stereotype of a lazy black man, which is part of why I suspect they constantly bang on that drum. But even if you factor out that racist tinge entirely, there is some kind of bizarre GOP fantasy involved that assumes a President should be some kind of Rambo Action Hero, ala Bush's Mission Accomplished photo-op. Perhaps this explains their Putin fantasies, because he appears barechested on horseback, which has the smell of Reaganesque manliness.\n\n\nBut actually a competent President with good cabinet heads should be able to handle immediate response to a crisis from anywhere with phone calls, especially for example a situation like Benghazi where military command is already authorized to respond defensively to direct attacks on US personnel stationed abroad without consulting the President. How silly to think that when Americans are fired upon they should wait until they hear from the President before doing anything. The idea that the President should be watching on video and giving commands in real time during an attack like that is a TV fantasy worthy of a Jack Bauer \"24\" fiction. \n\n\nOn the Border crisis he has already put plans in place, mobilized personnel and resources, given directives, etc. To expect that he personally should be busy around the clock with whatever the 24-hour news cycle is obsessed with is completely laughable.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAny opportunity on the right to call Obama \"uppity\" without actually using those words will be beaten like a dead horse.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

On another note, I find it interesting that L'il Kim Jong Un proposed a joint investigation of the Sony hack, which is like Dick Cheney asking to do a joint investigation of CIA malfeasance.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSlight addition to your comments about 11sep01.\n\n\nThere was at least one other attempted hijacking, out of New York involving a United crew on a 767 going to the west coast (fully loaded with fuel).

Can't find the transcript of what they said but, on reflection, it seems they realized they \"missed\" out.\n\n\nCondi Rice lied when she stated that no one had ever tried to fly an airplane into a building before. From before suicide pilots of WWII, to as late as 1994, an Air France 767 was hijacked, then landed in Marseille, France to fuel up for crashing into the Eiffel Tower, the extra fuel making quite a display.

I've mentioned this before, but one of the fundamental differences between liberals and conservatives is that conservatives have a narrower circle of empathy, much more limited to people they directly know and cherish (family, neighbors, business partners, maybe their local community or people they help through church) and much less likely to encompass any systemic understanding of a problem. It's why they can be generous and compassionate when someone they know is struggling with something while heartless and cruel when it's a member of a faceless mass of people (worse, a faceless mass of people who don't look like them). \n\nNow that Alzheimer's has crossed into Jeb Bush's circle of empathy by hitting someone he knows, he cares about it and is more sympathetic. But until then . . .\n\nThe key word here is narrower. All of us tend to be more sympathetic to people we know and cherish, and more sympathetic to people we consider to be part of our \"group\" versus outsiders (otherwise we'd be spending more on foreign aid). \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMaybe when Jeb's \"super PAC\" is ruled illegal, as punishment, the monies should be dispersed to medical research.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If that reduced consumption of \"Big Macs\" then, in my book, that would be a positive, globally.\n\nAs far as \"reducing jobs\", consider a person working three jobs at $10 per hour vs two jobs at $15 per hour, in change allowing the person to do all sorts of other stuff like spending more time with their families, in the process, releasing one job to the workforce.  If an organization needs to reduce their labor force simply due to the minimum wage then it is a combination of not raising the price of the widget and not being very intelligent as to staffing.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Not only does ACA impose (initially modest) financial penalties, but it creates a competitive, reputational incentive that's just as powerful. Prior to ACA, hospitals either didn't devote resources to reducing readmissions, or had those resources stymied by countervailing interests, such as the potential loss of revenue and the resistance to change in work processes by doctors and nurses. Most fundamentally, the change required is one in mindset--rather than just managing a particular event--the index admission--you have to think about an individual patient's needs over time and across the care \"continuum\"--home, hospital, doctor's office, nursing home, etc.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhile interesting, make certain that hospitals/doctors have not found a way around that particular statistic, perhaps, re-defining \"re-admission\" in some way.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And why should they? The laws explicitly noting that people should use the bathroom *they* think they should use just codified what was already happening, and maybe giving people whose outward appearance doesn't match preconceived societal norms a little protection.\n\nAlso,  I don't see how that (codifying for protection what was already happening, that no one thought about) is \"starting the fight\". But I've disagreed with KD about that before. \n\n\nETA: an important part of the transition process is living as the identified gender, for an extended period of time.  Which necessarily means using the facilities assigned to the gender the person is transitioning to.

Epinephrine was first isolated in 1901. It's a very old drug. Epipens are cheap to manufacture and also a potential life saver. I was therefore shocked to hear today (from an informed source) that the retail price of Epipens is $500. Surely my source is mistaken I thought. Let's google an answer. Sure enough I found plenty of Epipens for $118 ...\n\nhttps://epharmacies.com/drugs/epipen/\n\nOh wait, those are all Canadian mail order pharmacies. Let try 'epipen us price' ... and the true retail price of an Epipen in the United States is ... <b>$535 to $552</b>.\n\nhttp://www.goodrx.com/epipen\n\nWe've seen multiple instances of predatory pharmaceutical pricing but I find this one particularly outrageous. Epipens are carried by children with potentially life-threatening allergies. Why hasn't the 'free market' responded? 1) My source told me there's only one dominant manufacturer (Mylan) because 2) the products of a second player (Sanofi) were recalled. Perfect opportunity for a price gouge I guess (and the price won't drop with only two major players). It gets worse. Epipens were originally based on military technology.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector\n\nMylan is literally extorting money from frightened parents. Epipens have a shelf life of only one year, so Mylan is in a beautiful racket. The Canadian government protects its citizens from predatory pharmaceutical pricing. Ours does not.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMuch of television these days is nothing more than a framework upon which ads are hung.

Are we really going to elect a man who not only doesn't keep his promises, but is out to milk unsuspecting folks who trust him for every cent they have.

Kevin assumes that if Hillary is guilty the response to non-charges will be a \"massive backlash\", but if she is innocent the response will be \"grousing for a week or two\".\n\nThis makes no sense.  The truth is that it is impossible for anybody outside the DOJ to fairly evaluate the evidence against Hillary.  If Hillary is charged, the case will become public.  But if Hillary is not charged, nobody will ever know how strong the case was. So, regardless of whether Hillary is guilty or innocent, if charges are not brought, the public response is going to be the same: Democrats will say she is innocent and Republicans will complain that the Obama DOJ is biased.  My guess is that the GOP response will be somewhere between mild grousing and a \"massive backlash\".\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nGame theory implies a rational actor.

The flight to  L.A. from San Francisco  takes about an hour. You need to get to the airport at least an hour early to make sure you get through TSA screening.

When I got to LA  I had to wait 30 minutes for my bag, and 40 minutes of waiting for the bus I take to get me from the airport to Van Nuys. The bus was late because the freeway was congested. The freeway was still congested (is the 405 Freeway ever not congested?) so it took nearly two hours to make the trip.

For those who don't know. afterburner was simply injecting fuel directly into the exhaust stream, increasing thrust, and, noise.  Only the first few minutes of a flight were conducted with afterburner, the rest was less than 100%, it was pretty quiet at 60,000.\n\n707s may still be around, mostly as reconnaissance aircraft, the RC-135.

Unpressurized and without oxygen, you only have a 30 to 60 seconds to move your muscles at normal cruise altitudes  After that time, you are paralyzed but conscious and your muscles, without oxygen, will not move no matter how much you try.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

She went on for years doing this and managed to never, ever, put on her private server anything that would be of any use to foreign powers. That's some pretty fucking amazing discipline.\n\n\nThe shitheads talking blackmail? They know nothing.

Many \"served\" on ships and had/have no idea about \"in-country\".\n\nOne Kerry issue concerned his assertion that a few of his missions involved taking specialized forces up river at night into Cambodia.  The Swift Boaters rose up, denouncing his assertion, saying the US had no operations in Cambodia and were uncritically believed by the media.  I have two friends who flew 0-1 Birddogs (relatively quiet) and told me several times that one of their recon missions was to escort, from the air, Swift Boats as they delivered/picked up special forces in Cambodia (the delta being very much like a maze that would change each season, rendering unassisted  water transit closer to that experienced in the movie \"African Queen\".)\n\nNeither one were voting for Kerry.\n\nThe contradiction was no contradiction.

Unlike the Clintons, of course, who just give to charity to further their own agenda.\n\nAnything else?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nInteresting you should mention that because the Trump Modeling agency looks a lot like a high-class escort service and the few interviews the \"models\" have given to the media strongly suggest a lot of pressure to \"date\" rich people, especially those who have business relationships with Trump or those with whom Trump apparently wanted to curry favor.   Indeed, the description of the way in which these mostly foreign women were handled---threats about deportation, keeping their identity and travel papers and deplorable living conditions---is at least mildly suggestive of these women having been trafficked.    Which would make Trump a pimp, in addition to being a narcissist, a sociopath, and an all-round disgusting person.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"They have a lot fewer protections against reprisals that come from the business world.\"\n\nNailed it.

In what some might see as a paradoxical twist, Clinton's job approval ratings have fallen after the impeachment process ended with his acquittal, and are -- in Gallup's most recent May poll -- at 53%, the lowest since August of 1996.</blockquote>\n\ni'm sure the GOP is up for some wild retro Clinton porn, but the rest of the country was never really into it.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nClinton rebuttals: \n- I'm running for President, not Bill.

First, the company rarely backs one up.  Many layovers are FAA minimum, which would require a delayed departure the next day.\n\nThe last time I filed a police report was several years ago for a smoker.  It took me about one hour twenty minutes to finalize the police report.  The company would not compensate for a ride to the hotel (I was not illegal).\n\nUnless a police report is filled out by an accuser, there is no action taken by the police.  The company (one of the majors) is even worse about this.  In my capacity as lead crew member, I always ask that the accuser notify the FAA as well as HS.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Maybe they should do inspections to check for compliance.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n\"3. City Council of Flint, their mayor, and city's emergency manager (appointed by the state), decided to leave Detroit and get water from a nearby source. Local construction companies and the water utility were all excited and the \"stimulus\" construction would provide for Flint.\nDemocrats, Rachel Maddow and others have desperately pined the mess solely on Michigan's Republican governor, he's one of many culpable, but not alone. Documents abound show the city council was in favor of this plan, as was the mayor.\"\n\nTruthiness in action. The mayor and city council had NO power to veto the deal; the city was controlled by the emergency manager appointed by the state. Reps, especially Alex Jones, have tried to obscure this point for years.\n \n\"5. Flint switched their water supply to the Flint River. The engineering firm brought in to consult strongly advised them to treat the water for Ph level, and Flint's own water utility has documentation that they heard and received this advice, but nobody did.\n6. Residents started complaining about the water to city officials. No one did anything.\"\n\nNobody and no one being the emergency manager. See above.\n\n\"8. Activists got university officials to come test the water, and it failed. The governor was notified, and finally the state government got into action.\nAll levels of government in Michigan are culpable in this disaster. Democrats trying to pin this solely on Rick Snyder are misleading you. He should be in trouble for this, but so should many others.\"\n\nPlenty of blame to go around, yes, but the buck stops somewhere, and Snyder's efforts to avoid any culpability have been pretty pathetic. It's like the guy whose kids stole your car blaming you for leaving a door unlocked.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nKennethillindsy : Many Flint residents cannot afford paying for city water _and_ buying the water filters.  The state should have been directed to supply water filters and bottled water to those whose filtered water does not make minimum standards.

Works for him.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nA major part of the reason Republicans have been so merrily dynamiting virtually all norms of governing is that they've not paid any price for doing so (much the reverse, in fact). Honesty apparently not paying in any way leads, unsurprisingly, to the Reign of the Liars. Trump's electoral base doesn't care, or even notice, that he isn't actually accomplishing anything positive (far too wonkish to pay attention to those liberal statistics, and in any case information suggesting Trump is anything less than a roaring success is Fake News\u2122). You may think I'm exaggerating, but in fact this is where we are.\n\nAssuming the U.S. can't rouse itself to notice reality, then reality will eventually assert itself rather harshly. I'm expecting that Trump will eventually create a yuge recession. At first he'll deny it's happening, then blame it on anyone or anything handy, then berate his successors as they, as they invariably must, deal with his mess after he's been deposed. The main suspense will be whether this happens on a scale of months or years.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nRepublicans simply want a president who parrots the republican oligarchy.

IMO instilling fear (or appearing to do so) is designed to appeal to Trump's base. It's the appearance of action, rather than the outcome, that is more important.

Better to upgrade the security.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nFake statistics.  Military spending is foreign aid too, since we're the ones keeping the world safe.  And a lot of Medicaid is foreign aid, since I've heard that illegal immigrants get a lot from that.  And from food stamps too.  Immigration spending is foreign aid, since it's spent to aid in getting foreign people back home.  And since making our world secure is foreign aid, Social Security should probably count as foreign aid too, since that's all about security -- it's even in the name.  On that basis, throw in Homeland Security as well, since we can't aid by making the world secure if the homeland isn't secure.  \n\nWhen you add it up foreign aid is a large part of the budget, way more than 1%.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"Not as a % of GDP. And that's really how one should account for it.\"\n\nWhy?  More GDP needs \"protecting\"?  Perhaps you meant per capita, but even then, you are on thin ice.  Perhaps, as an example, one has 100,000 people living on Long Island.  One allocates x amount of military expenditures to \"defend\" Long Island.  Say the number of people double.  Are you suggesting military expenditures to double?  I doubt it.  I am pretty sure you should be able to apply the example I gave to, say, a doubling of the GNP (which is even worse) or most any other measure that increases.\n\nWhat you are blathering about is money spent to have an \"excellent\" military presence overseas.  One nuke could pretty much make your \"Great White Fleet\" into a covering for the sea bottom, that which is not vaporized, so I assume you are, in essence, going on about military presence in multiple encampments, providing more targets for those cranky about most anything.\n\nPerhaps the US is going about this all wrong.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It would inspire a \"race to the bottom\" among states, leading eventually to one state underbidding all the others and getting ALL the tax revenue, insurance companies getting the least possible regulation, and consumers getting screwed, much as we have with the similarly (un)regulated credit card industry.\n \nThe \"conservative\" twist is less dang gummint regulation of the Holy And Most Free Market.  Companies want it because profit, and the rank-and-file want it because stupid.\n \nAdding: I have theorized for a while that this attack on ACA may, quite ironically, lead ultimately to single-payer.  If it succeeds, and maybe even if it doesn't, the insurance market could collapse, which would create a massive political issue and demand for government action, to which single-payer would be a very simple solution.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"It's worth pointing out that it does have one fatal flaw: it would cost a lot of money.

If the law in question was passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a Democratic (read: presumptively illegitimate) president, then the SCOTUS should feel free to strike it down for any convenient reason. (Scalia's specious rule is a good example of this.) OTOH if the law was passed by a God-fearing Republican majority and signed by a chosen-by-God Republican president, then it should never even be questioned.

Now we just have to wait to find out what they want to do. </blockquote>Omg, I can't believe I'm left to hoping for Trump to do something decent. I <em>know</em> what Ryan wants. I guess there's the hope that Trump will screw up the screw up.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n\"Now we just have to wait to find out what they want to do.\"....It's more about what they can/can't do than what they want to do. They can't do anything about the health care saboteurs of the \"Freedom Caucus\" who seem hell bent on passing a \"reform\" that will guarantee an electoral calamity in 2018. As long as the Caucusians insist on their kamikaze strategy, the GOP will remain fractured and impotent and Trump will become increasingly infuriated by it all, because he's Duh Boss and he just doesn't get the whole separation of powers thing.\n\nThere's only two things Trump can do about that. (1) He can either sabotage Obamacare and try to blame the dems in order to make his party seem less greedy and inhumane while he pretends to be presidential, or (2) he can abandon the Caucus and work across the aisle with the dems to pass a package that offers less than the present plan but more than the uber right wing of his party is proposing. But that second option would cause the long festering ideological civil war within the GOP to explode. \n\nBut remember, this is the POTUS who told the Freedom Caucus to \"forget the little shit\" because he wanted to talk about \"the big picture\".... getting himself re elected in 2020. It's all he cares about. He really has no interest in the wonky details of the plan or how many millions of people get kicked to the curb. So whatever happens, you can bet it's going to be equal parts laughable, ugly and just plain despicable. \n\nYour GOP: Party before country. \nYour POTUS: Ego before party. \nYour future republican health care plan: Grab your ankles and pray for divine intervention.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe \"Dr.\" being \"honorary\", IMO.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I think he campaigned on withdrawal didn't he? (I may have missed a flip-flop or two), and he gave reasons at that time.  He won the election (according to the rules), so why wouldn't he do it?  It would cause a lot of disruption, but I don't think Trump promised that things would run smoothly for everyone.  Actually trade with Canada and Mexico would probably not change a great deal whatever Trump declares.  Kevin's attitude seems to be based on the standard establishment neoliberal idea that any threat to \"free\" international trade is not to be thought of.\n\nAccording to current effective \"rules\" the President has the effective authority to drop nukes or other bombs any time he wants.  Isn't there more danger in that?  If he could ever get Congress to work with him, Trump could do a lot more damage in many areas.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nWay to miss the point.

One reason \"apprehensions\" are down is that the \"cops\" are not \"apprehending\", which could be for many different reasons.  Weather could easily play a part in this, the unusually raining winter has slowed and even cancelled patrols.  An alarm goes off and no one drives through treacherous back roads to investigate.\n\nI like your charts and graphs as well as your analysis.

This followed earlier reports of the Senate Intelligence Committee requesting data from FinCEN, including \u201cinformation about shell companies, money laundering and the use of property transfers.\u201d Also in the past week, Robert Mueller, Special Counsel, was appointed by the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct an independent investigation regarding Russia\u2019s cyberattack. Taken together, that makes three sets of investigators who may be reviewing and analyzing documents from FinCEN in order to better understand financial connections among the President\u2019s campaign, his business organizations, and Russia.\n***\nIn its financial intelligence capacity, FinCEN\u2019s role in the Congressional investigations would be to provide financial information regarding Russia\u2019s cyberattack, and regarding any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee has said that documentation from FinCEN will be \u201cabsolutely critical to the Russia investigation.\u201d If there were any link between Russian actors and campaign personnel, FinCEN data may show a financial trail.</blockquote>\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI wonder how many investigations would commence if Hillary had won the presidency (not just the popular vote) and immediately installed daughter, Chelsea, and her son-in-law, Mark Mezvinsky, into the inner sanctum of the Oval Office !

Trump is killing further protections for the environment, which might have led to a much more productive and safer form of fracking.\n\nI am constantly amazed at the ignorance displayed by Americans.

Deny women equal rights, and the instability of nations is almost certain. The subjugation of women is, therefore, a threat to the common security of our world and to the national security of our country,\u201d she said in 2010.\n\nThe study, published March in the peer-reviewed journal Political Research Quarterly, examined data from 156 countries from the period 1981 to 2005 and found strong support for the Hillary Doctrine. Countries with lower levels of women\u2019s rights were more likely to have had anti-American terrorist incidents than countries respectful of women\u2019s political rights, even after accounting for political, economic, social, and religious factors.\n. . . .</blockquote>\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nPerhaps someone should help NK increase the range on their nukes so as to bring DC into focus.\n\nA more efficient use of capital for NK would be terrorists who could bring down most any Trump branded facility, one disrespectful tweet, one \"hotel\".

Republicans have no intention of passing tax \"reform\". Tax reform would solve problems and inequities facing the poor and the middle class. Tax reform would expand the earned income tax credit, or cap the home mortgage interest deduction at, say, $100,000 interest per taxpayer per year, or end the \"carried interest\" deduction that lets hedge fund managers pay taxes at lower rates, or bring the capital gains rate closer to the earned income rate. Republicans don't want reforms, which would make the tax code fairer. Republicans want to lower taxes on the super-rich, and that's not tax reform, Don't call it tax reform.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat was funny, \"fist\".\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

That said, if the the new conditions are now the new normal--then it's not the 500 year flood anymore...\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI live in Houston. My house is underwater and will be unlivable once I can return. While I don't disagree that climate change has a big impact on the storm, the 100/500 year storm estimates haven't been adjusted to all the building that's happened here in the past ten years. There are strip malls and large retail stores everywhere, each with an asphalt parking lot to hold thousands of cars. Much of the flooding is swell from upstream, areas that have also seen rapid population and development growth in recent years. Houston area has surpassed its ability to expand population and land use-wise. I don't think people are ready for that conversation yet.
