caught but has no way of knowing whether there might be a cop there either in an official or unofficial capacity after all this is the kind of voter fraud that conservatives are insisting is rampant if you believe that put a cop there preferably in plain clothes except they don't believe it the object is to prevent some year old black woman who was born at home and never had a birth certificate and never learned to drive from voting but back to the fraudster what kind of incentive would you have to provide someone to take that risk no matter how small i think it would be easier and safer to scan the obituaries for a month prior to an election than it would be to go through the phone book and hope for the best personally i also strongly believe that it is better to simply accept a small amount of fraud rather than to potentially disenfranchise the same amount of voters in the name of preventing fraud i think you'd probably disenfranchise hundreds or thousands of voters for every potential fraudster but i'm glad to see you've changed your mind what changed it in the run up to you were supportive of voter ids if i recall in fact i think that's how we met rand paul has 'evolved' a bit on this issue too i'll bet you dollars to donuts that voter registration cards being sent to the concrete plant is the result of some minimum wage worker trying to fill their quota for voter registration remember acorn wasn't engaged in voter or election fraud despite the charges people were registering mickey mouse to earn a paycheck but mickey never showed up to vote acorn was destroyed but no criminal charges were ever brought because no crimes were committed though james o'keefe did lose a civil suit that cost him k and still lives in his mommy's basement in contrast that guy in fla hired by the state republican party who was throwing out democratic registrations will be going to jail eventually for election fraud did you see the tape of the guy asking people to mark 'republican' on their registration forms because those are the only ones i get paid for that was floating around here last week we do have a fraud problem but it's not individuals showing up to vote"", ""dead in the water republicans are also pretending that a minority of voters gave them some kind of mandate instead of viewing their surprising thanks russia wins as a yellow light to proceed with caution but i'm growing enormously sick of the pity party for the special snowflakes who voted for trump the constant refrain of 'we don't understand them ' yes a lot of liberals are over educated jackasses who look down on their noses at plumbers and auto mechanics until they find themselves in need of one a lot of folk look down on modern medicine until they need a doctor too both liberal and conservative i suspect a lot of atheists also cry out to god in moments of desperation i know i do and a lot of trump voters will be enormously harmed by anything republicans will be able to agree on they need a bi partisan bill to repair obamacare failure to understand what you need or might need is part of the human condition and looking down our noses is one of the failures man kind get over it trump voters are not special mis understood and prosecuted snowflakes they're humans who voted against their self interest because they were unaware of how it would hurt them i'd say the real republican failure is one of marketing they just need a new slogan time 'repair and restrain ' going to the center with a bi partisan bill and call it a victory trump made a deal with the dems and he got a great deal but republicans don't listen to me they're still doing the opposite just to to peeve me so far as i can tell"", ""why didn't bernie run things are much much worse than stated here on january obama will hand off to donald trump a dramatically enhanced executive branch this includes picking and choosing which congressional enactments to enforce enhanced interpretations of executive orders thereby providing for rule by decree law making in administrative agencies whose leadership trump will now get to pick and much much more you saw the irs go after tea party groups right what happens when the irs goes after progressive groups with a vengeance under trump's leadership or when the epa simply stops regulating the coal industry face it the imperial presidency of obama will be transferred and will become the ultra imperial presidency of donald trump and trump will have both houses of congress and will be appointing an eighth of the federal judiciary because the gop senate has only acted on eight judges for obama since taking power what can the democrats possibly do the gop senate has already threatened to ditch the requirement that anything pass by votes so trump will get to pick up to four supreme court judge more if thomas resigns as he has said he would if the gop takes the presidency as it has media pressure for the right at least much of the media has had its credibility blown by the wikkileaks revelations media is now divided between gop and democrats and no one on the right almost half the country will paying any attention to democratic media face it the democrats have screwed up and screwed up royally bernie would have made a much better case for the presidency and would have had a much better shot than hilary so warren can make all the noise she wants it will make not one bit of difference a piece of advice have your passports ready""]"

changing how has it changed over the last or or years what are the causes of this change specifically how much of it is likely due to human activity and to what extent is it outside the normal range of climate variability in what ways and to what extent have these changes been good or bad for humans and the natural environment assuming that climate change is happening and that it is subject to human influences and that the changes are undesirable what is the cost and effectiveness of taking action to reduce or reverse change it seems to me that the answer to should be easy to demonstrate there's pretty good and consistent evidence that the climate has warmed at least in northern temperate zones for at least the last years and get more problematic although i expect that in a vacuum most people would vote for no change over change but i think the key point given the current state of the environment economy and technology is that the projected costs to appreciably reduce human impact on climate are prohibitive if the climate modelers are correct and we'll have to reduce worldwide fossil fuel use by or keep use constant while capturing and sequestering of emissions just to stabilize climate at c higher than the baseline wherever that baseline is then the world will vote to keep climate changing i don't think that americans and europeans would agree to reducing their energy usage by this amount and i certainly don't think the poor and growing populations of asia latin america and africa would agree to decrease their already low fossil fuel use their intent is to dramatically increase their fossil fuel use if you believe that climate change is both bad and human caused or at least human influenced it seems to me the only rational strategy is to seek research to develop practical non carbon energy sources or effective ways to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere while preparing to deal with whatever effects come from climate change""]"

divide the world to pro and anti vaccine populations this polarises the debate and cannot work vaccines have their risks and benefits some work better than others some are riskier than others the overall benefit of some vaccines has been proven beyond reasonable doubt it is reasonable to make some vaccines mandatory because the benefits are so obvious and or that they work only if a certain fraction of the population is vaccinated but accepting the benefit of some vaccines does not compel one to accept the benefit of any vaccine that might be invented the fact that some should be made mandatory does not mean that all should be mandatory the risks and benefits should be weighed in all cases and the conclusion may not always be the same beyond the general considerations above one should also keep in mind that information is asymmetric manufacturers know more about their product than authorities and authorities know more than the public that vaccines are a big business and making one mandatory can be like hitting the jackpot there is every reason to be vigilant denying ignoring risk does not inspire confidence i do not doubt the reality of the cancers i do not even doubt that the vaccine is efficient in reducing infections and eventually cancers and other complications although i wonder whether there is compelling evidence of actually reducing cancers as the vaccine has not been around for very long however i cannot accept that there is no risk and that nobody can get hurt by the vaccination perhaps seriously the cdc themselves recognise the existence of side effects in a certain number of cases it also recognises that this vaccine causes more of certain side effects such as fainting than other comparable ones and therefore amended their protocol recommending the administration of the vaccine while seated and observation for minutes afterwards not a standard procedure for all vaccines a litle bit of fainting is not the end of the world but for the child that faints this may be a very bad experience more serious side effects like convulsions can also be frightening and can clearly occur in a small of the cases young girls and their parents should not be blamed if they see it as a threat this should be weighed against the potential benefit a certain reduction in the risk of contracting a disease many years later i hope the evidence strongly favours the vaccine but i am not convinced by the article which ignores the risks and neither by your reply which insinuates that risks exists only in the minds of some anti vaccine

you will absolutely see that hugely important facts are blacked out of the media constantly are the recently reported measles outbreaks in the u s being caused by the failure to vaccinate or the failure of the vaccine shockingly clinically confirmed reports of measles vaccine failure in fully vaccinated populations stretch back a quarter of a century from around the world in a recent cnn health opinion piece too easily confused with reporting titled us measles cases in may be the worst in years elizabeth cohen cnn's senior medical correspondent blames the cases of measles the cdc reported occurring from jan through aug th on visitors from countries where measles is common and vaccine objectors within the united states what makes her conspicuously non referenced statistics so disturbing is that she is ignoring a substantial body of literature including peer reviewed and published epidemiological and clinical studies indicating that the recent measles outbreaks are just as likely caused by the failure of the vaccine as by presumably irrational and or irresponsible parents exercising their legal right and responsibility to choose whether or not to vaccine their children let's fill in the data that so obviously got flushed down the memory hole by this irresponsible piece of cnn 'reporting ' first we should acknowledge one underreported fact of immunology vaccine induced antibody elevations do not guarantee real world protection against the pathogen the vaccine is intended to immunize us against which is the only true measure of their value this is not a new observation it goes back decades with a study published in the journal of infectious diseases finding that even though of a population of urban african children had measles antibodies after vaccination vaccine efficacy was not more than or take a look at study that found that even when the measles vaccine successfully generates an elevation of measles specific antibodies out of have non protective titers or one from that found that within a highly vaccinated community experiencing an outbreak of measles antibody responses to measles could be found in of the unvaccinated versus only of the vaccinated they conclude a history of prior measles vaccination is not always associated with immunity nor with the presence of specific antibodies again the point remains the same vaccine induced synthetic immunity does not guarantee real world protection and certainly not with anything near effectiveness despite what the cdc vaccine manufacturers or mainstream news reports imply by blaming the non vaccinated for vaccine failure associated outbreaks read our report on the groundbreaking study published in the journal immunity that challenges the primary antibody based justification for vaccination if you need a more in depth explanation of this critical point second there is plenty of research available today demonstrating that the adverse health effects associated with the measles vaccine and particularly the trivalent mumps measles rubella combination vaccine may far outweigh their purported therapeutic effects that even if a vaccine is successful at preventing and or delaying infection from measles this does not mean that this will improve the overall health of those vaccinated to the contrary it has been known for several decades that the administration of measles vaccine in underdeveloped countries may actually be resulting in higher infant mortality rates this has in fact been a persistent criticism levied against unicef's vaccine heavy strategy in certain regions of africa which appear to have increased mortality rates unicef is not solely to blame as there are quite a few 'charitable health organizations' patting each other on the back for 'saving lives' by reducing 'vaccine preventable diseases ' at the very moment that mortality from vaccine associated adverse effects are increasing this is exactly what's so deranged about the global polio eradication campaign whose claim to have virtually eradicated wild type polio in india obscures the fact that the live vaccine specific strain of polio believed to be twice as lethal as the natural form may now be causing close to cases of polio vaccine associated injury a year measles vaccine failures documented for a quarter of a century around the world""]"
