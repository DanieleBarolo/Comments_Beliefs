{"title": "Glenn Beck to Bring Soccer Balls, Hot Meals to Illegals: 'We Must Open Our Hearts'", "body": "Glenn Beck said bringing soccer balls, teddy bears, and hot meals to illegal immigrants who have been detained along the U.S.-Mexico border will be the most right thing he has ever done.On July 19, Beck will travel to McAllen, Texas, because he believes Americans must “open our hearts” to the illegal immigrant children who have been unlawfully entering the country.“I’ve never taken a position more deadly to my career than this – and I have never, ever taken a position that is more right than this,” Beck claimed,according to The Blaze.Beck said helping illegal immigrant children, most of whom have fled Central American nations, was more “right” to him than even calling out radical Islam.“We’re going to fill some tractor-trailers with food, with water,” Beck said. “The churches have asked us if we could bring teddy bears and soccer balls, so we’ve loaded up a whole tractor-trailer of nothing but teddy bears and soccer balls. And then I’m going to go serve breakfast and lunch, and I’m going to help unload these trucks, hot meals for 3,000. That’s what we’re doing.”Some illegal immigrants have been found to have contagious diseases and dangerous gang affiliations, but Beck also emphasized that the United States should be accessible to “all those fleeing poverty and violence.”“Through no fault of their own, they are caught in political crossfire,” Beck said. “And while we continue to put pressure on Washington and change its course of lawlessness, we must also help. It is not either, or. It is both. We have to be active in the political game, and we must open our hearts.”The number of illegal immigrant children under 18 years of age who have unlawfully crossed the border has drastically increased since President Barack Obama unilaterally enacted his temporary amnesty program for certain DREAMers in 2012.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2014/07/08/Glenn-Beck-to-Bring-Soccer-Balls-Hot-Meals-to-Illegals-We-Must-Open-Our-Hearts"}
