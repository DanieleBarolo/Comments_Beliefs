It’s a reference to the biologically female women who have transitioned to men but also retain reproductive organs and become pregnant.“They basically said that, you know, women and people who identify as women are not the only people who are affected by anti-abortion laws,” said Cox. “That people who identify as women are not the only people who get pregnant and — we can applaud for that. It’s the truth.”“If I were that trans man, I would really want to have language that incorporated and included my experience,” Cox added. “Thinking about this reminded me that a language is also a place of struggle, but that this isn’t just about being politically correct.The actor continued:This is not just about virtue signaling, that when we use language that excludes people on pertinent issues it can jeopardize their health and well being. This is about language that is appropriate and fully inclusive is a matter of life and death for so many people out there.”For me, as a trans woman, I can’t get pregnant. I’m very grateful for that! But it’s an issue that I don’t actually have to think about. But if we are the person who has to deal with the issue, it is so important to be inclusive and to have our issues dealt with.Cox, who is biologically male, is Hollywood’s most high-profilecampaigneron trans issues. Cox became the first openly transgender person to be featured on the cover ofTimemagazine and also be nominated for a Primetime Emmy award.Follow Ben Kew onFacebook, Twitter at@ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/05/23/video-trans-actress-laverne-cox-slams-abortion-laws-during-college-commencement-speech/"}
