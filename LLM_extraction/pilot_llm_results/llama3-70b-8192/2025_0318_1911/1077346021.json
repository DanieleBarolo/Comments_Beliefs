  "article_body": "U.S. Immigration Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agents have expressed strong concerns over House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and other Representatives pushing for immigration legislation that would legalize the status of America\u2019s at least 11 million illegal immigrants.In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured), House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA), House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate \u201cGang of Eight\u201d members did, regarding how they are working on immigration legislation.\u201cAt every step, this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation\u2019s security and the American taxpayer,\u201d Palinkas said.\u00a0\u201cI documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven [S. 744] only to have them ignored.\u201cI worry the House may be following a similar path.\u00a0Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Paul Ryan, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally, in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.\u201dPalinkas warned, too, that any group of \u201cstep-by-step\u201d House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly whatHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,\u00a0Gang of Eight members Sens.Bob Menendez (D-NJ)andChuck Schumer (D-NY),Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,\u00a0andsome Republicanshave said they want to do.\u201cThese plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency \u2013 USCIS \u2013 that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,\u201d Palinkas said. \u201cAdvancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.\u201dIn his statement, Palinkascited a recent MSNBC reportwhere Gutierrez said he, Goodlatte, and others have worked on a \u201ccompromise\u201d position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), another Democrat, on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been, like they were from the Senate conversations, excluded from all discussions among House leaders. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t USCIS officers being consulted on this \u2018compromise\u2019 offer?\u201d Palinkas asked.He further expressed concern over Cantor\u2019s GOP DREAM Act, tentatively called the KIDS act. \u201cI am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act, one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted,\u201d Palinkas said.\u00a0\u201cLegislators, including Mr. Cantor and\u00a0Mr. Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens.\u00a0But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?\u201dHe warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. \u201cThis seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,\u201d Palinkas asserted. \u201cShould we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?\u201dPalinkas alleged that, under the Obama administration, USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. \u201cAt USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,\u201d he said.He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: \u201cUSCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits.\u00a0This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications.\u00a0We have become an approval machine,\u201d \u201cFailure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits,\u201d \u201cAdministrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible,\u201d \u201cApproval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them,\u201d \u201cA management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer.\u00a0We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency\u2019s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.\u201dGoodlatte, Ryan, and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to theMiami Herald, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: \u201cWe have to address it. It\u2019s a moral issue.\u201dIn addition,according toPolitico, House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year.This coming weekend on Univision, McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner \u201cover the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform. I believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority.\u201dMcMorris Rodgers is the fourth highest-ranking member in the House GOP conference.",

  "parent_text": "If you pass immigration reform you better pack your bags. We already have one bad idea we can't afford (Obamacare). American families do not want to pick up the bill so you can give you big donors cheap labor at our expense. Besides you don't reward lawbreakers. The people are guilty of all sorts of crimes (identity fraud, forgery) to mention a few. We have a big enough dependent society of our own. These so called hard working people will soon be lazy azz welfare slugs once you bring them out of the shadows.",

  "comment_texts": "They're already out of the shadows! Collecting welfare and having many \nanchor babies paid for by US taxpayers! They've all been given a green light \nby Democrat leaders, Obama, Reid and Pelosi. Even the Republican\nidiots like Ryan has jump into the Amnesty deal. At Catalina Island, CA\nthe population of about half the island are illegals and they have jobs \nat restaurants, shops and even the hospital. They are not afraid that they\nbroke the law because as far as they are concerned, the US once belonged\nto Mexico and they will be taking it back! And they probably will, having help \nsocialist/communist media; politicians; unions; business; chamber of \ncommerce...the list goes on. America, are you paying attention? Obamacare\nwas created for all the illegals who will be given amnesty and all their extended family who will be in untold millions.",
