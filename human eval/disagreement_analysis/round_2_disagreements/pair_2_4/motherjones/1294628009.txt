Really I think it comes down to the idea of toleration=discrimination against those whose practices (or whose practice of those practices) encourage discrimination based on certain things. Are they being religiously discriminated against by  being asked to tolerate life choices their employees make that in no way affect how they perform their work duties?

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

PARENT COMMENT:
Hobby Lobby is not trying to force the employee to live by their standards they are fighting to not be forced to live by the employee's standards and be forced to provide funding for things they that go against their religious beliefs.  It's an interesting paradox.

How can an employee be forced by the courts, to live by their employers' religious dictates, even if the employer is a person? I still don't get it.
