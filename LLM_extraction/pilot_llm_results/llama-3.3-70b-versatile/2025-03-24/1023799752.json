  "article_body": "America\u2019s third largest health insurer, Aetna Inc., has announced it will not sell insurance on New York\u2019s Obamacare health insurance exchange, the fifth state the company has pulled out of in the last few weeks.The other states Aetna has opted out of for Obamacare insurance exchange participation are Maryland, Ohio, Georgia, and Connecticut.\u201cWe believe it is critical that our plans not only be competitive, but also financially viable,\u201dsaidAetna spokesperson Cynthia Michener. \u201cOn New York, as a result of our analysis, we reluctantly came to the conclusion to withdraw.\u201dObamacare\u2019s individual mandate requires all Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. Some health insurers are foregoing participation in the Obamacare exchanges due to costly mandates to provide a selection of services and a requirement to accept all individuals regardless of pre-existing conditions.Aetna never intended to participate in California, and Anthem Blue Cross and United Health Group made a similardecisionto steer clear of California\u2019s Obamacare exchanges as well.In 2009,President Barack Obama promisedhis government healthcare overhaul would not threaten personal insurance plans.\u201cNo matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period,\u201d he claimed. \u201cNo one will take it away. No matter what.\u201d",
