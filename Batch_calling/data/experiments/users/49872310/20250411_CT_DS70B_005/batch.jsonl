There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual (Groth & Gary, 1982, p. 147). In a more recent literature review, Dr. Nathaniel McConaghy (1998) similarly cautioned against confusing homosexuality with pedophilia. He noted, \"The man who offends against prepubertal or immediately postpubertal boys is typically not sexually interested in older men or in women\" (p. 259).  This well known lack of a linkage between homosexuality and child molestation accounts for why relatively little research has directly addressed the issue. Proving something we already know simply isn't a priority.  Indeed, a commentary that accompanied publication of the 1994 study by Jenny et al. in Pediatrics noted that debates about gay people as molesters \"have little to do with everyday child abuse\" and lamented that they distract lawmakers and the public from dealing with the real problem of children's sexual mistreatment (Krugman, 1994).  \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Access the report, charts and graphics here: -\n-http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/\n\nWith the raw material coming from a foreign country\u2014and with a large part of the final product likely to be exported to foreign countries\u2014bringing the tar sands crude into the U.S. would do little for our nation\u2019s energy independence.

A new species of politician, Homo Obstructus, has crawled out of the muck that has been flung in Congress for time immemorial. They are an aggressive species, but unlike the equally aggressive bees they are most definitely not Africanized, and tend to be fearful around their fellows who are even slightly tan. Their aggression is often directed against others of their genus, in particular the Homo Sexual.\n\nHomo Obstructus is classified as an invasive species. They rapidly multiplied\nwhen they found their way into the halls of Congress, where they pushed out\ntheir less aggressive cousins and occupied their territories. Here they became\nbloated after consuming vast quantities of pork. They often stand erect and\nbellow for long periods of time, which is unusual because they do not possess a backbone. They merely puff themselves up with hot air and try to look imposing.\n\nSome say global warming is responsible for their emergence, although ironically they don't believe in it. But the increased temperature causes inflamed passions and overheated rhetoric. It is fervently hoped that they will one day grow tired of the exposure, and go back to where the sun don't shine.  -I borrowed this comment from a poster in a NYT article.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

My body cannot effectively fight off the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria and because of that I have had 4 lung collapses in the past 30 years. The bacteria eats at my tissues and when it eats through the lung tissues, my lung deflates. The last time a hole was opened, it burst a vein and I bled internally. I was saved by a neighbor who saw me collapse and she called the paramedics, otherwise I would be dead now. Because it was a pre-existing condition, I had no insurance and the whole situation cost me $18,000. Today, that operation would cost ~$25,000. Until I hit 65 years old and signed up for Medicare, I spent over 10 years in morbid fear of another attack that could kill me because I would not be able to pay for it. The alternative would be to file for bankruptcy and lose everything I have. Rather than insure me for an amount I could afford, the companies basically said \"too bad for you\". That comes close to a death panel definition in my mind. Profit is their bottom line and they are not going to give up one red cent in profit to help people.\n Again, I would love to hear your definition of a death panel. And, of course, the definition used by the rightwing paranoids is a myth (or just a plain lie, which most myths are).\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Therefore, any press that afraids of Darrell Issa because they're reporting based on what he says rather than investigating on the whole story, then they should be ashamed of themselves, don't you think?  \n\nWe have \"low information voters\" because we have suck media who fails to investigate the whole story, but reacting to what X says and Y says to coverage their 24/7 news cycle.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAfter all these years Kevin and many other liberal bloggers still don't seem to get it. Issa and other right-wing clowns are not performing for the benefit of anybody rational (outside the news media), they're doing it for the Republican base. The base - that is Republicans who are not high-income - has to be distracted from the fact that the big-money wing is trying to steal them blind.\n\nThe media, especially cable, need Issa because they have 24 hours to fill with \"news\".\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nCan you prove those accusations?

First, it provides a moral justification for maintaining a society that routinely deprives various groups of its rights and privileges. Racist beliefs discourage subordinate people from attempting to question their lowly status; to do so is to question the very foundations of the society. In addition, racism focuses social uncertainty on a specific threat, thus justifying existing practices and serving as a rallying point for social movements. Finally, racist myths encourage support for the existing order. Thus it is argued that if there were any major societal change, the subordinate group would suffer even greater poverty and the dominant group would suffer lower living standards. History demonstrates that racial ideology increases when a value system is under attack.\"\n\n-http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/694689/posts\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Yes, calling someone dumb and not having anything to say beyond that clearly indicates who's right and who's wrong doesn't it? So watch this and STFU.\nhttp://youtu.be/qbG3G1EPPUI\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHow does one go about neutering the brain?

Those things put people out of work.  I remember one single voice of protest and it was a movie where the owner of a restaurant was replacing the workers with machines (to make things better).  The waitress and the cashier  were being replaced, and the cook was very upset. The cook looks into the camera at the end of the movie, and asks when (not if), he would be next. I thought it was a warning for all of us that the future might be difficult.  I have a plan B which is to dress up in cute outfits and go downtown to the busy areas with my shoe-shine box if things ever get tight. Today, you have to have a plan B.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAutomation is a secondary problem. Since Reagan, the govt has redistributed several trillion taxpayer dollars upward, largely to corporations, always insisting that this is \"vital to job creation.\" We now have a fraction of the jobs, at worsening wages, and no safety net. Corporations continue to use this money to expand internationally, building factories outside the US, shipping out our jobs. There's nothing we can do about it.  We're living with the consequences of Reagan's deregulation frenzy, strongly supported by middle class America, and corporations have been pulling off the Great Bank Robbery of the US right under our noses.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"Let the politicians know we are here and we care and want to protect ourselves.\"\n As long as their re-election money comes from ALEC, The Kochs and other 1%er's, and the huge corporations, they are not going to care about you or me or any other minor constituents. They no longer need us to get into office, and, once out of office, most have been and are going to be set for life, thanks to their corporate sponsors. Nowadays, MONEY buys elections, not constituents. And watching the direction we seem to be driving in, I think that in the near future, it would be very appropriate and even necessary to get rid of the electoral college.\n But, I agree wholeheartedly with what you have said about being active, mainly because we have no real alternative at this time. Unfortunately, I don't think we can muster the number of like-thinking people together to unite with. There are just too many who will follow the tea party and the conservatives to their deaths.\n So, in the meantime, write and sign petitions, call your congressmen/women, e-mail them and just keep pushing the envelope.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

He/she/it actually valued the life of the mother over that of the fetus.\n\nGod actually mandates abortion when the fetus is a product of adultery (Numbers 5). A jealous and suspicious husband should bring his wife to the local priest, who forces the woman to drink a poisonous \"water of bitterness\" to bring on God's \"curse\". If she experiences \"bitter pain,\" if her \"belly swells\" and her \"thigh rots,\" she fails the test and becomes an outcast. Virtually all Biblical scholars agree that this voodoo ritual and its cloaked euphemisms refer to an induced (not to mention unsafe) abortion. The word \"thigh\" in the Old Testament usually means genitals, but in this case, it refers to the uterus and its contents. \n\nExodus\n21:22- \u201cIf men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that there is a miscarriage, and no harm comes to the mother: he shall surely be punished, according as the woman\u2019s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life,  eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,  burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

During my time there, after leaving the bush, it was \"off limits\" to military personnel,  mainly, I think, because there were no \"A\" approved eating establishments up there. We were instructed NOT to eat in any eating establishment that did not have an \"A\" sign above the door. On a snorkeling trip up north, we noticed that the people did not speak English, at least not very well. We stopped at a small little caf\u00e9 to get something to eat. With much ado, we were able to order some hamburgers and fries. As we sat at a table, we heard a dog outside yelp and whimper, then, silence. About 1/2 hour later, our food arrived. As we sat there eating, the old lady who took our order sat looking at us with this humongous smile on her face. I asked her son, who could speak a pretty decent English, why his mother as so amused. He asked us if we understood that up there in the north of the island, hamburgers were actually made from dog meat, not beef. Also, the French fries were made from mashed potatoes, shaped and frozen to retain their shape while frying. Made for a very interesting texture.\n Ah, north Okinawa is oh so beautiful. The ocean water is so clear and blue.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I was in basic training at Fort Ord with over 400 young men from the state of Washington. They ALL enlisted to get into the war \"against\" America. And, yes, beyond a doubt, they were lied to and brain-washed into believing that what they were doing was the right thing to do. Most of them came from families where the father served in WWII. Those fathers were proud of their involvement in that war, and rightfully so. But they just could not get beyond the differences between the second world war and the war in Vietnam. My own father begged me to join the military so that I could go to Vietnam and fight against the evil Communism. He never took the time or energy to investigate why the U.S. was really involved in that war. Never saw the millions of dollars being raked in by the war machine at the soldiers expense, just like the war in Iraq. War for profit for the few, not for the democratic ideal.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Hence, it has no meaning when discussing \"babies\". All mammals have babies, not just the human species. One becomes a \"human\" when two humans procreate. The terms \"human\" and \"zygote/fetus/baby\" are not directly synonymous. So, when discussing abortion, the term human has no bearing or meaning. Your question is really \"when does a zygote/fetus become a living viable baby\"? \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Call them know nothings, call them stupid, they know what is in their immediate self-interest, and it's not far-off threats (read: a decade or more) or externalized costs. Who cares?

They do not even pretend to make this representative by not even including equal members of both parties.  I'm certain that it will be as useful as the last 3 or 4 'investigations' that have been conducted.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAll these Bengazi screamers are such hypocrites. They never said a word after 13+ embassy attacks under Bush. They never said a word after thousands of lives lost in Iraq. If Bengazi is such an issue, why then were these people silent to this day about these issues. It's very obvious it's not about Bengazi, it's about hatred for the Pres and Hillary and their stated attempt to make him fail. Where is the outcry over dozens of deaths in schools and movie theaters? All these lives are of less importance than those in Bengazi. Nobody is denying that what happened there was a tragedy and we all grieve when an American is lost. However, if this be the case, all lives are of equal value. Additionally, why is there blanket criticism of some type of universal health care. After all, approx 1,000 people die every week due to lack of ability to afford medical care. We all know ACA has its problems but how about finding mutual solutions rather than simply say NO. The so called caring of people is reflected in the GOP's policies and voting records. No concern for those struggling especially children and vets. In fact, they detest the struggling. Michelle Bachman even had the gall to state \"if you don't work, you shouldn't eat\" as if every person unemployed is a lazy moocher. You'd think these people were entitled to benefits without working at jobs in which they were terminated for whatever reason. Sorry to be off topic, however, the calls of concern for the four deaths in Bengazi makes no sense when you look at the big picture proving this isn't about life, it's about politics.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIn a heated exchange on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, Lynch pointed out that Republicans voted against additional funding for embassy security when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton requested it:\nLYNCH: When Secretary Clinton and the State Department asked for additional funding for embassy security, [Republicans] all voted no. They all voted no. \n\nWALLACE: We\u2019re getting a little bit off track now. I understand there\u2019s an issue about security. It\u2019s a little bit off the track. I want to stay on course here \u2013\n\nLYNCH: No, this is the point.

I always thought that it began in Egypt in the 3rd century B.C.E.\n\"The trades in Ancient Egypt had levels of earnings and power associated with them. Sons typically followed in the same trade that their father practiced. Some children at this time attended a general village school while others attended a school designed for a specific career such as a priest or a scribe. \n Schools taught writing, reading, math, and sports as well as morals and manors. At the age of fourteen, sons of farmers or craftsmen joined their dads in their professions. Those children whose parents had higher status careers continued their education at special schools usually attached to temples or governmental centers.\"\n- http://historylink101.com/n/egypt_1/a-education.htm\n \n\nAs for religion, they also kept us in 500 years of dark ages as they monopolized education.

And what would you consider to be the \"right\" track?\n I completely agree to term limits for ALL politicians and, to be honest, i belive the same for the SCOTUS. My problem is how many total years is enough. I do not believe that a one term limit of 2-4 years is enough for these politicians to become efficient at their perspective jobs on the committees they work on. I would also like to see their benefits scaled back. Between their paychecks and their benefits, it is no wonder so many decide to make politics their permanent jobs. Hell, just look at the current House, they work ~ 160 days a year and still do not have to work for their pay.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Bloomberg for instance blew 50 million to lobby against a firearm safety organization who would have much more time to get back to proper firearm education if they didn't have to work to defend against a constant barrage of attacks against our rights. If Bloomberg spent even a tenth of that 50 million on actual gun safety and education rather than smear campaigns and lies then just maybe this coming year would see a decrease in accidental firearm related deaths but no, who cares about the safety of peasants.\n\nAs for the message that Leno would be sending by attending...

A new species of politician, Homo Obstructus, has crawled out of the muck that has been flung in Congress for time immemorial.\nThey are an aggressive species, but unlike the equally aggressive bees they are most definitely not Africanized, and tend to be fearful around their fellows who are even slightly tan. Their aggression is often directed against others of\ntheir genus, in particular the Homo Sexual.\n\nHomo Obstructus is classified as an invasive species. They rapidly multiplied when they found their way into the halls of Congress, where they pushed out their less aggressive cousins and occupied their territories. Here they became\nbloated after consuming vast quantities of pork. They often stand erect and bellow for long periods of time, which is unusual because they do not possess a backbone. They merely puff themselves up with hot air and try to look imposing.\n\nSome say global warming is responsible for their emergence, although ironically they don't believe in it.

I just read a little earlier that Rand said that the whole situation was caused because of cigarette taxes. Swear to god!\n\n\"Appearing on MSNBC\u2019s Hardball with Chris Matthews on Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) \u2014 a likely GOP presidential candidate in 2016 \u2014 admitted that video footage of the arrest was horrifying, before launching into a detailed critique of cigarette taxes. Paul also appeared to blame politicians who support taxing tobacco products for Garner\u2019s death.\"\n\n \u201cI think it is important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes so that driven cigarettes underground by making them so expensive. But then some politician also had to direct the police say, \u2018hey we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette.\u2019 For someone to die over breaking that law, there is really no excuse for it. But I do blame the politicians. We put our police in a difficult situation with bad laws.\u201d\n\n- http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/03/3599475/rand-paul-blames-cigarette-taxes-for-the-death-of-eric-garner/\n\nA Libertarian speaks!!!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I believe that if they all actually saw it firsthand, many would change their minds about approving it. And if that would happen, we would have a majority of citizens calling the government out and possibly convince the Congress to take action. With 59% backing these actions, i don't see our present Congress doing anything at all. I am really, really sick and tired of all the hatred the people of this country have been exhibiting and most of it seems to stem from basic ignorance. If they can be taught, maybe some of that hatred will dissipate. I may very well be wrong, but i want ACTION NOW and i believe this would help get us there.

I certainly know what you are saying. I have a neighbor, who, in 2008 was selling guns and ammo out of his truck on the side of the highway. I asked him why and his response was that IF Obama became president, he would take their guns away. I asked him if he understood how the US Government works and he looked at me askance. I explained that the President is a member of the \"executive\" branch which cannot write legislation, only enforce it. That bills are originated and passed in the Legislative branch of Government. Again, he looked at me as if i were an idiot. A few days later, he came to my house to tell me that he went to the library and read a book on the US Government and found that what i told him was true. He immediately quit selling guns and ammo on the side of the highway. He learned something and to an extent, changed his behavior. As i have said to you before, it all starts with one and keeps adding up. The more educated a person becomes, the fewer ignorant people they will elect into their Government. So, for all those Texans who just keep on apologizing, i say, get out there and educate the others. One person, alone, can do very little to change the number of fools in any state. But as they educate those around them, the number of knowledgeable people increases.\n And you are right, i was and am being a little hard. Hope it has some effect. Being from a redneck, ignorant state, i too feel bad and embarrassed.But i will not apologize, i will work on making changes, one person at a time. Do you remember the old adage \"if you start with a penny and then double it everyday.....?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

We are also raising taxes because the federal corporate tax haul used to amount to 30% of our federal tax base, and corporations are now paying only 9% of the pie. We are also raising taxes because they have been at all time lows, and during a near depression all of the money earned for a long time now has been at the very top while they have risked little with plenty of government subsidies. \n\n\nThis is nothing new.

Maybe if the people there concentrated on healing the divisions the monuments would have less of a negative impact. Maybe they can just tell of a time that we don't want to repeat. The south needs monuments for things that bring people together.I think we need to remember the mistakes of the past but I don't see the advantage of living in it and glorifying a time that was dreadful in our history. I don't know what the line is between remembering history and glorifying it but I hope the south can do it soon.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nHave you considered the monument in Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.? The statue is directly across from the Wal-Mart Museum, which was Sam Walton's first store.  In my opinion, the statute is worse than any of these pictured.  And Wal-Mart indirectly controls what is in that square.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe facts will always lay as they will. That doesn't mean we have to view their reminders on a daily basis. We can and will continue to learn without public displays. Text books will teach us much better than monuments.

Second, the spill was discharged into the Animas River, not the Colorado, and has been diluted to the point of invisibility before even reaching the Colorado.  And guess what?  The President WAS NOT doing the clean-up preparation the EPA was involved in at the Gold King Mine.  If you think somehow the POTUS is involved in the day to day activities of each and every government agency, you must believe he has superpowers.  Since the EPA immediately shouldered the blame, absolutely no-one is attempting to place blame on the GOP.

Good for the Turks.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nPutin's theory of foreign relations, 'the bad neighbor policy', is starting to bearing fruit.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they responded by massacring the Turkmens.\n\nExcellent quick description of Russia's over-hyped air campaign in Syria,\n\nhttp://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/syrians-are-paying-a-high-price-for-russia-s-cheap-bomb-1744082828\n\n<blockquote>There are real doubts as to what targets Russia is actually striking in Syria. Not just when it comes to what parties they are targeting, so far those largely being Syrian rebels that pose the most threat to the Assad regime, not ISIS, but also as to if the targets they are striking are valid at all.\n. . .\nWhen watching Russia\u2019s air war over Syria as it has evolved over the last two months, one might think Russia has no guided air-to-ground munitions capability at all.\n\nThis is far from the truth. Russia produces a whole slew of precision guided missiles and bombs, using all types of smart guidance systems. Again, the issue is that they are not cheap, and so the powers that be in Russia have decided to rely largely on dumb bombs for the Syrian campaign. \n\nMuch media attention has been given to Russia\u2019s air war in Syria. Indeed it has been quite the spectacle, but the press needs to come to their senses when it comes to Russia\u2019s true air combat capabilities. Even their most advanced aircraft, such as the Su-34 Fullback, has been seen loaded with general purpose dumb bombs more than anything else. And although about 37 fixed-wing combat aircraft may look impressive lined up on a runway in a satellite photo, it is a relatively tiny force, and one that gives Putin a big show out of a relatively small investment.\n\n<b>The only reason these aircraft have been able to accomplish so many sorties is their close proximity of their base to their targets. Wheres U.S. and coalition jets sometimes have to travel hours to and from the battlefield, Russia\u2019s forward deployed tactical aircraft can fly to their target and back in a matter of minutes.</b> Additionally, the pressure to drop as much ordinance as possible on \u201cISIS,\u201d which is what Russia calls anyone fighting the Assad regime, is almost certainly a factor. Are the majority of these bombs hitting anywhere near a legitamate target? We simply don\u2019t know.\n\nWhen it comes to all the hype surrounding Russia\u2019s air combat power in Syria, using helicopters to bomb cities is certainly not a sign of a cutting-edge air combat force. In fact, Russia\u2019s Syrian air campaign has more in common with American air combat capabilities of the late 1970s to early 1980s than it does with the present.\n\nFootage of targets being attacked by Russian jets have been paraded in the press, the vast majority of which show mostly unguided weaponry being employed on supposed enemy positions and compounds in the countryside.

A new species of politician, Homo Obstructus, has crawled out of the muck that has been flung in Congress for time immemorial. They are an aggressive species, but unlike the equally aggressive bees they are most definitely not Africanized, and tend to be fearful around their fellows\nwho are even slightly tan. Their aggression is often directed against others of their genus, in particular the Homo Sexual.\n\nHomo Obstructus is classified as an invasive species. They rapidly multiplied when they found their way into the halls of Congress, where they pushed out their less aggressive cousins and occupied their territories. Here they became bloated after consuming vast quantities of pork. They often stand erect and bellow for long periods of time, which is unusual because they do not possess a backbone. They merely puff themselves up with hot air and try to look imposing.\n\nSome say global warming is responsible for their emergence, although ironically they don't believe in it. But the increased temperature causes inflamed passions and overheated rhetoric. It is fervently hoped that they will one day grow tired of the exposure, and go back to where the sun don't shine.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You think maybe they just woke up one morning and decided it would be cool to become someone who gets shit on, bullied, beaten and even killed? It is a choice that they make, to be despised and ridiculed by right wing pseudo christians? A choice they make to be denied the same rights. liberties and and freedoms as other people? Do you also believe that the blacks in Africa woke up one morning and decided to get captured, relocated to other countries so they could become slaves with all the inherent rights of slaves? It must have been their choice to belong to other people along with the resultant beatings, killings, torture and child stealing? They were born black and did not choose to be so!!!! Trans and other LGB's were BORN that way, they did NOT just decide to be so. But, to people who are so phucing frightened by those who are \"different\", i guess that belief is somehow soothing to the mind.\n So, out of curiosity, what do you think about Ted Cruz's father saying the family have talked with the god guy? Does that meet with your approval?\n\n\"My son Ted and his family spent six months in prayer seeking God's will \nfor this decision. [...] It was a Sunday. We were all at his church, \nFirst Baptist Church in Houston, including his senior staff. After the \nchurch service, we all gathered at the pastor's office. We were on our \nknees for two hours seeking God's will. At the end of that time, a word \ncame through his wife, Heidi. And the word came, just saying, \"Seek \nGod's face, not God's hand.\" And I'll tell you, it was as if there was a\n cloud of the holy spirit filling that place.

The research, conducted by the University of Minnesota, identifies a virulent strain of humans who are virtually immune to any form of verifiable knowledge, leaving scientists at a loss as to how to combat them. \u201cThese humans appear to have all the faculties necessary to receive and process information,\u201d Davis Logsdon, one of the scientists who contributed to the study, said. \u201cAnd yet, somehow, they have developed defenses\nthat, for all intents and purposes, have rendered those faculties totally\ninactive.\u201d More worryingly, Logsdon said, \u201cAs facts have multiplied, their defenses against those facts have only grown more powerful\u201d In fact, it now appears that part of the answer is that they have altered their brains to substitute real facts with pseudo-facts manufactured by a mutant strain of RWTT (right wing think tanks). While scientists have no clear understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the fact-resistant humans from absorbing data, they theorize that the strain may have developed the ability to intercept and discard information en route from the auditory nerve to the brain. \u201cThe normal\nfunctions of human consciousness have been completely nullified,\u201d Logsdon said.\nWhile reaffirming the gloomy assessments of the study, Logsdon held out hope that the threat of fact-resistant humans could be mitigated in the future. \u201cOur research is very preliminary, but it\u2019s possible that they will become more receptive to facts once they are in an environment increasingly without food, water, or oxygen,\u201d he said.\n-By Andy Borowitz, The New Yorker 17 May 15\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If Trump gets no more support than he received in the primary, then he loses on a truly epic scale.\n\nKeep in mind that it is always possible that someone will convince Trump that it wouldn't be a bad idea to pivot to the middle, so it is vital to get as many people as possible to mentally commit to #NeverTrump.  Once they have made this decision, it becomes much, much harder for Trump to convince them vote for him.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI was merely bringing up the fact that it is not ONLY liberals who are defensive and sensitive by reminding all who read these comments that a so-called Republican like Da Trump is the same, if not more so.

The research, conducted by the University of\nMinnesota, identifies a virulent strain of humans who are virtually immune to\nany form of verifiable knowledge, leaving scientists at a loss as to how to\ncombat them. \u201cThese humans appear to have all the faculties necessary to\nreceive and process information,\u201d Davis Logsdon, one of the scientists who\ncontributed to the study, said. \u201cAnd yet, somehow, they have developed defenses\nthat, for all intents and purposes, have rendered those faculties totally\ninactive.\u201d More worryingly, Logsdon said, \u201cAs facts have multiplied, their\ndefenses against those facts have only grown more powerful\u201d In fact, it now\nappears that part of the answer is that they have altered their brains to\nsubstitute real facts with pseudo-facts manufactured by a mutant strain of RWTT\n(right wing think tanks). While scientists have no clear understanding of the\nmechanisms that prevent the fact-resistant humans from absorbing data, they\ntheorize that the strain may have developed the ability to intercept and\ndiscard information en route from the auditory nerve to the brain. \u201cThe normal\nfunctions of human consciousness have been completely nullified,\u201d Logsdon said.\nWhile reaffirming the gloomy assessments of the study, Logsdon held out hope\nthat the threat of fact-resistant humans could be mitigated in the future. \u201cOur\nresearch is very preliminary, but it\u2019s possible that they will become more\nreceptive to facts once they are in an environment increasingly without food,\nwater, or oxygen,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists: Earth Endangered by New Strain of Fact-Resistant\nHumans \n\nBy Andy Borowitz, The New Yorker 17 May 15\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Their employees performed like Keystone Kops and failed to recognize their pipeline had ruptured and continued to pump crude into the environment,\" said NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman. \"Despite multiple alarms and a loss of pressure in the pipeline, for more than 17 hours and through three shifts they failed to follow their own shutdown procedures.\" Enbridge restarted the pipeline twice in that 17-hour period, pumping through oil that would account for 81% of the total spill.\" http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-07-24/-keystone-kops-bungling-led-to-costliest-u-s-pipeline-spill\n\nAnd here's what it looked like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSsxpzKaGTY\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHey!

His wealthy friends who control industries that would be crippled by mass deportations will take him aside and point out the following:\n\n(1) Illegal workers make up 5% - 6% of the private work force.\n(2) They do in fact pay non income related taxes.\n(3) American don't want to do the jobs that illegals do for the same pay in the same crappy conditions with no benefits\n(4) Mass deportations would cause social and economic chaos that would end up costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n(5) America's international reputation would be damaged severely by the optics of mass deportations.\n(6) Foreign markets for American goods, especially in Latin America, could be damaged through boycotts that would further damage the economy and cost more jobs being done by American citizens. The \"ripple effect\". It's a thing.\n(7) Illegals can't just be thrown out of the country. They have a right to a hearing, but the immigration courts already have a backlog of cases that has created a waiting times of more than three years. Dumping millions more people into that pool would necessitate a huge infusion of cash into the court system.\n\n(8) Given the long waiting time, all of those millions of people would have to be housed, fed and cared for somewhere. Are women, children and the elderly going to be thrown into jails? If not then holding facilities (a.k.a. \"internment camps\") would have to be built and staffed, and the millions of detainees would have to be provided with food and health care. Again, that would necessitate a huge infusion of cash and create suffering and terrible optics.\n(9) Both infusions, into the courts and the holding facilities aren't going to pay dividends. They're losses that could end up running into the tens of billions.\n(10) Nobody in the Trump campaign or the republican party has ever hinted at where all of this money would come from, but you know it wouldn't be from taxes and that only leaves cuts to existing programs.\n\nYou never hear any of this discussed in \"conservative\" circles even though they know damn well it's true. They've been beating this issue for more than a decade strictly for propaganda purposes, even going so far as shooting down their own president's reform bill in 2007.

Also, you see Putin puppet Assange talk about how he doesn't need to publish Russian info on wikileaks because they have a free Press? Hahahahaaaaaahaha. \n\nPeople are sheep.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nIt may be useful to adopt the following working rules (subject to modification, of course):\n \n1.  Trump is a serial liar.  He regularly says things that are provably false and/or that he himself contradicts the next day.  His words, as Lewandowski said, have no meaning.\n \n2.  Trump is primarily a showman and salesman.  His primary interests are self-aggrandizement (aka responding to a pathological need for approval and validation) and persuading a target audience toward some momentary end.  He has no interest in consistency or policy (or truth), except insofar as those address his primary interests.\n \n3.  Other Republican leaders (Pence, Ryan, McConnell, et al.) see Trump primarily as a distraction (aka \"useful idiot\") from their actions and ends, which (as always) primarily concern transferring wealth upwards, but which also concern social retrogression (imposition of radical Christianism, subjugation of people other than straight, white, Christianist males, etc.)\n \n4.  As a consequence of (1) - (3), we should ignore Trump entirely (except perhaps for twitting him occasionally), and instead we should work to oppose, obstruct, and counter the agenda of other Republican leaders.  Trump's words have no weight or validity, but he craves publicity and controversy like he needs oxygen.  We should starve him and instead focus the light on the rats doing the dirty work.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"Since trump can change his height at will...\"\n It amazes me that he can do the same thing when asked about his total worth.\nIn an interview with Timothy L.

He talked about the tax cut and added, \"1.54 Trillion dollars and they didn't even pretend to try to pay for it.\"  That's what republicans exist for. They hang around, get themselves elected then raid the peoples' treasury. That's why their dishonest voters elect them too.  What makes it true is that its what George Bush did too. Since they don't vote in our interests, why do they exist? Pirates?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nFunny. For months he's been telling everyone the election's all about him, the rallies are all about him, everything's all about him. But when it looks like it might not be a rousing victory? \"It's not me.\"\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWell, it's Wednesday and Donnie John has done just that. \n\n\"Ol\u2019 Trump did a press conference in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s House flip; the highlight of his prepared remarks was probably the segment above, in which he mocked members of his own party by name for losing their races.
