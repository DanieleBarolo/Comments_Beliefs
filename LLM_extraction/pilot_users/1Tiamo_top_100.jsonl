{"article_title": "Rust and Diamonds: Jane Doesn't Do Nancy Any Justice At All", "article_link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/08/14/Jane-Fonda-Nancy-Reagan", "article_body": "It would have been too much to ask for Hollywood to give the Reagans their due in the forthcoming movie \u201cThe Butler.\u201d You knew that going in. But either way, casting Jane Fonda in the role of Nancy Reagan was surely meant to push buttons, stir up controversy and generate interest in\u2013and hence, profits for\u2013the movie.This being the reality, let me then push some other buttons.The problem with casting Jane Fonda as former First Lady Nancy Reagan is not just that Fonda is nearly twenty years older right now than Mrs. Reagan was when she entered the White House in January of 1981, or that Fonda is at best a mediocre actress and that Nancy Davis was probably a better actress in her day.Or that the best thing about Jane Fonda the actress is her last name, or that in the looks department, Nancy Reagan had, and probably will always have, Fonda beat hands down.The problem goes far deeper than appearances. The very day Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, Jane Fonda was quoted as saying he was \u201ca lousy actor and he\u2019ll make a lousy president.\u201d Reagan reciprocated the minimal respect.Indeed, one would be hard pressed to think that Reagan would have approved of the casting of Fonda as his wife\u2013since in a letter he wrote to William F. Buckley during his presidency, he called Fonda and her then-second husband, Tom Hayden, \u201ctraitors to their country.\u201dReagan was being charitable. Fonda was not just a traitor to her country, she was also a traitor to humanity. \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d cheered on the North Vietnamese, and like many on the left in America, was pleased about the downfall of the pro-American South Vietnam government.As Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge came to power, springing from Cambodia (which the left went crazy over when Nixon bombed it) millions died at the hands of that murderous communist regime in the \u201ckilling fields\u201d and \u201creeducation camps.\u201d Were Fonda and her comrades happy about the extermination by communist thugs of innocent civilians? There is no evidence they supported the genocide\u2013but on the other hand, neither is there evidence they opposed it.Silence equaled death.And when the time came to show some compassion and help these people flee for their lives in hundreds of rickety boats, the American Left turned their backs on these helpless people because it didn\u2019t comport with their political views. Adrift in the South China Sea, the \u201cBoat People\u201d were easy prey for Thai pirates who committed heinous acts of rape, pillage and murder against the defenseless Boat People.George McGovern sniffed that Southeast Asian people should stay in Southeast Asia. Other liberals expressed similar indifference and Jimmy Carter, who had made human rights a theme of his presidency, dithered for a number of days before reluctantly allowing the Boat People into America.One liberal who did show mettle was Joan Baez, who held free concerts across America to raise money for the Boat People. Baez, a thinking woman\u2019s pacifist, didn\u2019t hate America; she hated war. Fonda, on the other hand, supported the war being waged by the North Vietnamese and by extension, the communists in China and Moscow, against the United States.Baez hated war, while Fonda reviled America. It doesn\u2019t get more black and white than that. Baez later took out full page ads in American newspapers denouncing the human rights violations in Vietnam.In response to Baez\u2019s compassion, Fonda wrote a letter to her denouncing Baez for trying to help the people fleeing communist oppression. \u201cYour actions only align you with the most narrow and negative elements in our country who continue to believe that Communism is worse than death.\u201d This was a long time ago but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true than \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d participated in propaganda broadcasts aimed at undermining the morale of US military personnel.There\u2019s ill irony, then, that she\u2019s now portraying Nancy Reagan. Fonda made a political cause of supporting the tormentors of the Vietnamese Boat People while Nancy Reagan and her husband were compassionately greeting these refugees in California as new Americans.Eventually, about 800,000 of the one million who fled Vietnam made it to America.Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan also greeted the American POWs\u2013along with Richard Nixon and Ross Perot\u2013kindly and warmly in California, as they were finally released. They both wept when told the stories of torture endured by the brave young American men. The young Americans\u2019 time in captivity might have gone a tad better without Jane Fonda egging their captors on.Diamonds and Rust indeed.There is no evidence that Jane Fonda did anything except cause misery in other peoples\u2019 lives when it comes to this difficult period of American history.Meanwhile someday someone will write a very good book about Nancy Reagan and what she meant to her husband and, by extension, America. It was said that if Reagan had wanted to be a shoe salesman, she would have made sure he was the best shoe salesman in America. It just so happened he wanted to be president. This country is fortunate for him and for her pushing him.She was tough in that White House and demanding on the political campaigns, but also kind and never gratuitously mean. Even today in retirement Mrs. Reagan still remembers birthdays and anniversaries, calls friends who have lost loved ones, and exhibits the class and style that she and President Reagan brought back to the White House.They say that behind every successful man there is a great woman. No one seems to know the origin of the phrase, but it certainly seems to have been true for George Washington, for Franklin D.

{"article_title": "Hometown Sheriffs to Meet with Boehner on Immigration", "article_link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/13/Boehner-s-hometown-sheriffs-show-down-with-Speaker-offer-local-opposition-to-immigration-efforts", "article_body": "The majority of local sheriffs in House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s Ohio district are heading in to meet with the top house lawmaker\u2019s office on Wednesday, Breitbart News has learned.Six out of seven sheriffs of the counties that comprise Boehner\u2019s eighth congressional district of Ohio will meet with Boehner\u2019s district director Ryan Day on Wednesday at 2 PM local time.\u201cThe purpose of the meeting is to get the congressman, the Speaker of the House, together with the sheriffs of his district,\u201d Sheriff Richard K. Jones (pictured) of Butler County, Ohio, said in a phone interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re basically asking that the Speaker not bring this [any immigration bills] out of [conference] committee. If it goes to [conference] committee, the Senate\u2019s version, we do not want this version that the Senate sent over to the House to come out of the House on immigration.\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to accomplish is to put pressure on the House not to bring this bill out of the House,\u201d Jones continued. \u201cLaw enforcement, sheriffs, around the country, a majority of us, border states and non-border states, we\u2019re having issues when they come into the United States with the crime, the drugs, the same old thing.\u201dJones gave several examples of crimes that illegal immigrants have committed in Butler County, part of Boehner\u2019s district, in recent years.A 9-year-old girl was molested by an illegal, then he left and went back to Mexico. It took us six to seven years to get this individual back and he left her to run home naked in the neighborhood after he molested her. He\u2019s in prison after we got him back. There was an elderly lady where her house was broken into by an illegal who molested her then in the process made her go take a shower and clean up then drive him to the ATM machine. He was illegal. There was a lady who was hit by a vehicle and knocked down. And she\u2019s in a wheelchair. I could go on. There was another lady who was killed by a group of illegals and they left the scene and it goes on. There\u2019s killings, there\u2019s stabbings, drugs have increased coming in from Mexico. This is just Butler County, Ohio. In Ohio, it\u2019s totally out of control, the drugs that are coming in, the killings.Jones said he has been to the border twice with the sheriff of Cochise County, AZ, who serves with him in the National Sheriff\u2019s Association. \u201cWe\u2019ve started seeing that our jails are filling up with people who are committing these crimes, getting out, re-committing crimes, getting out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThen they would flee; they would leave. Then we started having them to where they were committing heinous crimes.\u201dWhile Boehner\u2019s district is about as far from America\u2019s border with Mexico as one can get, Jones said that hardly means illegal immigration and the resulting crime and economic depravity do not affect the Speaker\u2019s hometown. \u201cThe border sheriffs will tell you they come across the border but they don\u2019t stay for a minute,\u201d Jones said of illegal immigrant problems in Boehner\u2019s district. \u201cThey shift them back into the inner parts of the United States.\u201dJones said illegal immigrants are accessing welfare benefits in Boehner\u2019s district, too. \u201cOur welfare, just in Butler County, Ohio, alone\u2013there\u2019s 88 counties in Ohio\u2013in Butler County, Ohio, in our county alone, we spend $8 million a month on welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not all for people who are here illegally. But a large portion of it goes to them and their kids who are over here in the United States.\u201dThe local economy is not getting any better, either, he said, adding that illegal immigration is not helping out-of-work Americans in the eighth congressional district of Ohio. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy a job here in Ohio and we\u2019re the fastest or second-fastest growing county in Ohio,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are no jobs. And what jobs there are, we don\u2019t want them going to people who don\u2019t deserve them. We want them going to our people coming out of the military and citizens of the United States.\u201dAccording to Jones, he and his law enforcement colleagues are fed up with these issues. \u201cI\u2019ve been in media all over the country for the past seven to eight years voicing this opinion and the sheriffs here in this district, we\u2019ve all had about enough,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe want this to stop.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to come out of the House,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Senate, like I said, they\u2019re all running for president of the United States and the Republicans have sold people out. It\u2019s a pretty hot topic here in Ohio and across the nation with other sheriffs. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re having this meeting here tomorrow.\u201dJones does not know whether Boehner will slow or halt immigration efforts in the House in the wake ofLee Stranahan\u2019s investigative reporton the sudden spike of asylum requests at the border andFox News\u2019 follow-on reportsabout the Obama administration\u2019s decision to expend taxpayer resources to house such illegal immigrants in hotels. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)has called forthe House to drop any and all immigration bills until the asylum issue is addressed and stopped.\u201cWe\u2019ve never heard from the Speaker,\u201d Jones said of the issue. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out tomorrow. We believe that this is the kind of pressure that stops it. Our congressman happens to be the Speaker of the House and he represents all the United States and all the Congress.\u201cHe\u2019s got different districts that he\u2019s got to deal with. But the Republicans and the Tea Party Republicans in the House\u2013people are watching,\u201d he continued. \u201cRonald Reagan said \u2018you dance with those that burn ya,\u2019 and buddy, you better remember where you came from.\u201dWhile Boehner himself will not be attending this meeting on Wednesday, the Speaker has been more receptive than House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. For weeks, Cantor has ignored requests for a meeting from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) National Council president Chris Crane to discuss immigration legislation.Boehner\u2019s spokesman Michael Steel told Breitbart News that the Speaker \u201chopes to\u201d meet with local sheriffs soon and is upset he could not on Wednesday. Boehner has still kept the door open to a potential conference with the Senate bill and a group of House immigration bills, but in a letter Boehner wrote to the local sheriffs, he said he has a \u201cshared commitment\u201d with them \u201cto stopping the Senate bill.\u201d\u201cI look forward to keeping the lines of communication open with you and other law enforcement leaders in our community as the immigration reform debate unfolds across our country,\u201d Boehner wrote. \u201cFixing our broken immigration laws through a step-by-step, common-sense approach that begins with enforcement is critical to creating an environment for economic growth and private-sector job creation in our country, and I share your commitment to ensuring Washington at long last gets it right.\u201dJones said the sheriffs in Boehner\u2019s district represent the viewpoint of a majority of sheriffs nationwide. \u201cThis is indicative of about the whole United States,\u201d he said. \u201cSheriffs have had about all they can take. We\u2019re tired of people in the federal government saying the borders are safe.They\u2019re not. I\u2019ve been there. They\u2019re not safe.

Sex has been a crucial component of the entertainment industry since the seductive vamps of silent film and the bawdy big mamas of roadhouse blues. Elvis Presley, James Brown and Mick Jagger brought sizzling heat to rock, soul and funk music, which in turn spawned the controversial raw explicitness of urban hip-hop.She continues:Pop is suffering from the same malady as the art world, which is stuck on the tired old rubric that shock automatically confers value. But those once powerful avant-garde gestures have lost their relevance in our diffuse and technology-saturated era, when there is no longer an ossified high-culture establishment to rebel against. On the contrary, the fine arts are alarmingly distant or marginal to most young people today.Some responses to this avowed defender of women:One of the reasons Presley, Brown and Jagger were successful was that the music was actually good, as opposed to the musically vapid garbage being spawned by Cyrus and her ilk.If Madonna\u2019s videos were \u201carguably among the best artworks of the decade,\u201d Michaelangelo, Raphael and Titian have nothing to worry about. Neither, for that matter, has Jackson Pollock.Stop complaining that Cyrus doesn\u2019t understand that pushing the envelope too far sexually isn\u2019t good entertainment in the same article where you gleefully write that \u201cYoung performers will probably never equal or surpass the genuine shocks delivered by the young Madonna, as when she sensually rolled around in a lacy wedding dress and thumped her chest with the mic while singing \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d at the first MTV awards show in 1984.\u201d You wanted public displays of hyper-sexuality, you got it.Paglia is laboring under the assumption that freedom for women means behaving in just any old way they want. It\u2019s just that Cyrus was too explicit for her tastes, which is quite remarkable. When feminists remember the word \u201cdignity,\u201d they\u2019ll have a far better understanding of what real women understand is basic to the feminine soul.", "parent_id": "1021619095", "parent_text": "", "comment_ids": "1021632473", "comment_texts": "Sorry to disappoint,but he isn't.", "comment_date": "2013-08-29", "user_name": "1Tiamo", "topic": 0}

Marco Rubio waded through a rowdy summer-recess crowd on Friday where he tried to focus more on the push to defund ObamaCare than the ongoing debate over immigration legislation,\u201dFox News\u2019 Serafin Gomez reportsfrom Orlando\u2019s Americans for Prosperity Summit.During his remarks, Gomez notes, \u201cRubio made no mention of immigration legislation that has irked some in the audience\u2013including a group of elderly women from New Mexico who were wearing \u2018Pink Slip Rubio\u2019 buttons.\u201dTheWashington Post\u2018s Matea Goldreportsthat Rubio \u201cdid not acknowledge\u201d the heckling crowd and did not directly address immigration legislation before Congress.ThePostquoted a couple Tea Party activists in the crowd disappointed by Rubio\u2019s performance in Washington.\u201cI\u2019d like to see Marco Rubio, just so I can tell him what I think of his positions: He\u2019s on the wrong track of being a conservative,\u201d Rick Barr, an activist from Indianapolis, told Gold.\u201cWe\u2019re all a little irritated with Marco,\u201d Judy Peterson, an activist and retired special education teacher, said, according to Gold. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve thrown him under the bus. But we would like him to, just come on. He hasn\u2019t explained it very well.\u201dThe continued pressure from the conservative base against Rubio comes as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), an opponent of the immigration legislation that Rubio shepherded through the Senate,predictedHouse Majority Leader John Boehner will lose his Speakership if he allows the Senate bill or anything like it to become law.\u201cIf he allows something to pass out of conference that looks anything like the Senate bill and is passed with a majority of Democrats, I think that will be the final thing he does as speaker,\u201d Paul said on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio program on Friday. \u201cSo, I think he knows that, and I think he\u2019s going to be very cautious, and I hope he will defend us on this and not pass something that looks like the Senate bill.\u201d", "parent_id": "1024739403", "parent_text": "Amnesty is gonna put alot of black people out of work.

John McCain and Lindsey Grahammet privatelywith President Obama at the White House over his call for Congressional approval of a military strike on Syria. Obama called for the vote on Saturday, saying that the Syrian government had recently used chemical weapons on its citizens and must be punished as a result. While saying that a vote against authorization of a strike would be \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d McCain and Graham also said the goal of military action shouldn\u2019t be to punish Bashar al-Assad, but to remove him from power.Obama promised that any military intervention in Syria would be limited and not represent an open-ended commitment. He said the military strike was intended to\u00a0\u201cto deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\u201dMcCain and Graham want Obama to go much further, however. In astatement released Saturdaythey said, \u201c[W]e cannot in good conscience support isolated military strikes in Syria that are not part of an overall strategy that can change the momentum on the battlefield, achieve the President\u2019s stated goal of Assad\u2019s removal from power, and bring an end to this conflict, which is a growing threat to our national security interests.\u201dRemoving Assad from power would require a significant military commitment. He has strong support from Russia, China and Iran. An additional complication is that the opposition forces, whom we would be assisting, have significant backing from jihadists and al Queda. In other words, there are no good guys.After their meeting, McCain and Graham indicated that Obama was receptive to expanding the mission in Syria. Graham said we was certain there was a \u201csolid plan\u201d from the Administration to \u201cupgrade the opposition.\u201d", "parent_id": "", "parent_text": "", "comment_ids": "1027352292", "comment_texts": "Regime change to Al Qaeda???

Last night, CNN attempted to do the same through blowhard Piers Morgan. But there is just one problem: CNN andTheDaily Newsare 100% wrong. The FBI hasjust confirmedthat a shotgun and two pistols were recovered, and that the \u201cgunman was NOT armed with [an] AR-15.\u201dTuesday morning\u2019sDaily Newscover hysterically blared, \u201cSame Gun Different Slay.\u201dInside, Mike Lupica continued the blare:This time the shooter is reported to be a Navy reservist named Aaron Alexis and when he is shot dead by law enforcement, taken out before he can put a gun to his own head the way Lanza did, he has his light, handy assault weapon with him, and a semiautomatic pistol, and a shotgun.But even if the shooter had used a semiautomatic rifle (which we now know he didn\u2019t), it would have been one he took from a security guard during the rampage. Maybe theDaily Newsdidn\u2019t get it wrong; maybe Lupica and company are so far over the edge that they are now calling for the American military to be disarmed?Meanwhile, over at CNN, within hours of the shooting, the network allowed Piers Morgan to launchhis own sanctimonious attack against the AR-15:\u2014\u2014But just a few hours later, CNN had to walk it back. Buried in an article singling out the AR-15, CNNreportedthat an AR-15 was not found on the scene.Apparently, sometime yesterday, the talking point went out that said that the anti-gun narrative coming out of the Navy Yard shootings would be to turn the AR-15 into this massacre\u2019s convenient left-wing bogeyman\u00a0 \u2014 all in an effort to get it banned.The left-wing, anti-science media blows it again by caring more about the agenda than the facts.This is especially devastating for CNN, a cable network desperate to get off the floor after non-stop debacles involving theBoston Marathon bombing, being caughtopenly pushing for gun control, and all things George Zimmerman.

{"article_title": "Dutch King: Say Goodbye to Welfare State", "article_link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/09/17/Dutch-king--say-goodbye-to-welfare-state", "article_body": "By TOBY STERLINGAssociated PressAMSTERDAMKing Willem-Alexander delivered a message to the Dutch people from the government Tuesday in a nationally televised address: the welfare state of the 20th century is gone.In its place a \u201cparticipation society\u201d is emerging, in which people must take responsibility for their own future and create their own social and financial safety nets, with less help from the national government.The king traveled past waving fans in an ornate horse-drawn carriage to the 13th-century Hall of Knights in The Hague for the monarch\u2019s traditional annual address on the day the government presents its budget for the coming year. It was Willem-Alexander\u2019s first appearance on the national stage since former Queen Beatrix abdicated in April and he ascended to the throne.Rutte may be hoping that the pomp and ceremony surrounding the king and his popular wife, Queen Maxima, will provide a diversion from the gloomy reality of a budget full of unpopular new spending cuts he revealed later in the day.A series of recent polls have shown that confidence in Rutte\u2019s government is at record low levels, and that most Dutch people _ along with labor unions, employers\u2019 associations and many economists _ believe the Cabinet\u2019s austerity policies are at least partially to blame as the Dutch economy has worsened even as recoveries are underway in neighboring Germany, France and Britain.After several consecutive years of government spending cuts, the Dutch economy is expected to have shrunk by more than 1 percent in 2013, and the agency is forecasting growth of just 0.5 percent next year.Willem-Alexander said that nowadays, people expect and \u201cwant to make their own choices, to arrange their own lives, and take care of each other.\u201dThe `participation society\u2019 has been on its way for some time: benefits such as unemployment compensation and subsidies on health care have been regularly pruned for the past decade. The retirement age has been raised to 67.The king said Tuesday some costs for the care of the elderly, for youth services, and for job retraining after layoffs will now be pushed back to the local level, in order to make them better tailored to local circumstances.The monarchy was not immune to cost-cutting and Willem-Alexander\u2019s salary will be cut from around 825,000 euros ($1.1 million) this year to 817,000 euros in 2014. Maintaining the Royal House _ castles, parades and all _ costs the government around 40 million euros annually.A review of the government\u2019s budget by the country\u2019s independent analysis agency showed that the deficit will widen in 2014 to 3.3 percent of GDP despite the new spending cuts intended to reduce it.Eurozone rules specify that countries must keep their deficit below 3 percent, and Rutte has been among the most prominent of European leaders, along with Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, in insisting that Southern European countries attempt to meet that target.Among other measures, the government announced 2,300 new military job cuts. That follows a 2011 decision to cut 12,000 jobs _ one out of every six defense employees _ between 2012 and 2015.However, the government said Tuesday it has decided once and for all not to abandon the U.S.-led \u201cJoint Strike Fighter\u201d program to develop new military aircraft. The program has suffered cost overruns and created divisions within Rutte\u2019s governing coalition.A debate over the budget later this week will be crucial for the future of the coalition, as it does not command a majority in the upper house, and it must seek help from opposition parties to have the budget approved.Challenged as to whether his Cabinet may be facing a crisis, Rutte insisted in an interview with national broadcaster NOS on Tuesday that he ultimately will find support for the budget.Geert Wilders, whose far right Freedom Party currently tops popularity polls, called Rutte\u2019s budget the equivalent of \u201ckicking the country while it\u2019s down.\u201d", "parent_id": "1048460077", "parent_text": "Bill Clinton announced that the era of Big Government is Over an created the welfare to work program, and then along comes the Communist Organizer Obama and reverses all the progress in ending the welfare state in America.

If gays like our pasta and our advertising, they\u2019ll eat our pasta, if they don\u2019t like it they will eat someone else\u2019s brand,\u201d hestated, according to the Huffington Post. \u201cI would not do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect toward homosexuals \u2013 who have the right to do whatever they want without disturbing others \u2013 but because I don\u2019t agree with them and I think we want to talk to traditional families.\u201dAurelio Mancuso, head of gay rights group Equality Italia, called Barilla\u2019s remarks an \u201coffensive provocation\u201d and urged a boycott of the company\u2019s pasta, sauces, and snacks.\u201cWe accept the invitation from the Barilla owner to not eat his pasta,\u201d Mancusosaid, sparking support for a boycott on social media.Alessandro Zan, a gay member of parliament, tweeted, \u201cYou can\u2019t mess around with consumers, including gay ones.\u201dOn Thursday, Barilla issued a statement, explaining that he was trying to say \u201csimply that the woman plays a central role in a family.\u201d\u201cBarilla features families in its commercials because it embraces anyone, and they have always been identified with our brand,\u201d he said.\u201cI apologize if my words generated misunderstandings or controversy or if they hurt some people\u2019s feelings,\u201d Barilla wrote on the company\u2019s Facebook page Thursday, according to theHuffington Post.In Barilla\u2019s latest ad for its Mulino Bianco cookies and breakfast cakes, Spanish film star Antonio Banderas is featured baking biscuits with children and talking to a chicken named Rosita.According to theHuffington Post, Italy \u201clags\u201d behind the U.S. \u201con gay rights, with attitudes toward homosexuality complicated by the country\u2019s strong ties to the Catholic church.\u201dBarilla Pasta was founded in 1877 in Parma, Italy, and now exports to more than 100 countries.

Lee Terry (R-NE) told Breitbart News that President Obama was illegally furloughing approximately two thousand federal civilian defense contractors at Offutt Air Force Base, in direct contravention of the Pay Our Military Act, passed last week through Congress and signed by Obama himself. Those four thousand employees represent approximately two thirds of the civilian personnel at Offutt Air Force Base.The Pay Our Military Act explicitly promises \u201csuch sums as are necessary to provide pay and allowances to the civilian personnel of the Department of Defense (and the Department of Homeland Security in the case of the Coast Guard) whom the Secretary concerned determines are providing support to members of the Armed Forces.\u201d According to Terry, Congress intent was to keep support personnel on the job, especially given that US Strategic Command is operated out of Offutt Air Force Base.STRATCOM\u201cintegrates and coordinates the necessary command and control capability to provide support with the most accurate and timely information for the President, the Secretary of Defense, other National Leadership and regional combatant commanders.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very upset with the White House decision to force furloughs, which I think are illegal furloughs because the law he signed last Saturday,\u201d Terry told Breitbart News exclusively. \u201cThis is a political game that they\u2019re playing, endangering this country. They\u2019ve had to lay off over 60 percent of their civilian employees, who are all basically retired military who just keep the same jobs and become civilians. These are integral people to protecting our nuclear arsenal and to our military readiness. This is a dangerous game this president is playing.\u201d\u201cAirplane mechanics are being furloughed,\u201d a representative from Terry\u2019s office stated. \u201cHow is that not critical to getting an airplane off the ground if we need to? This is an illegal furlough. The President is completely breaking the law. Congress passed it unanimously, he signed it into law, and now he\u2019s breaking that very law.\u201dOn Thursday, Terrypenned a letterto Obama demanding that he bring the employees back to work: \u201cI have been doing some research on this issue over the last couple of days. I have found that both the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have directed Acting Under Secretary of the Air Force Jamie Morin to direct the combatant commands to hold the line and not allow anyone other than \u2018excepted\u2019 employees to work. This is contrary to what Congress intended and needs to be rectified as soon as possible\u2026.This is unacceptable and needs to be overruled. Mr. President, Congress specifically sent this bipartisan legislation to you for your signature, because we all believe that these hard working patriots should not be pawns in this chess game\u201dTerry concluded, \u201cIt is very important as Commander-in-Chief to direct all of the combat commands to follow the law and bring back the workers who have been furloughed and do it as soon as possible.\u201dRep.

{"article_title": "Late Night Shutdown: Comics Tackle Topical Gags, Still Hit GOP Harder", "article_link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/10/04/Late-Night-Shutdown", "article_body": "As the government shutdown moved through its first week, the late night talk shows returned the medium back to the traditional satire we once enjoyed before the Obama Administration caused political humor to shut down.David Letterman is proving why his average audience member isalmost 59 years oldby using the shutdown to make some jokes about PresidentsGerald Ford(2:44) and George Bush.Of course the Oldest Presidential Joke is probably from Craig Ferguson who is counting the days of the Shutdown with the Presidents, meaning the writers don\u2019t expect it to last more than 44 Days. Tonight should be Madison.Ferguson had probably the funniest metaphor thus far: \u201cShut down like a Blockbuster video.\u201d He also made a poignant observation that IRS Auditors are considered essential, but the attorneys who help taxpayers through audits have all been furloughed.Most of the late night jokes are being made at the expense of a nebulous non-partisan creature called Congress, but as expected a couple of Republicans are lining up as victims of the comic assaults.First up is Rep. John Boehner, whose leadership of the House has afforded Letterman, Jimmy Fallon and Ferguson to make more jokes about his tan and the fact that his last name looks like another word that cracks up middle school boys.If there is no such thing as bad publicity, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) should be happy to learn that his filibuster elevated his name up to the level of late night jokes. Conan O\u2019Brien: \u201cDuring the shutdown, Ted Cruz will be donating his salary to charity \u2026 well, the charity is called \u2018Ted Cruz for President.'\u201dConan also found The Panda-Cam shut down as a good excuse to bring back the ever-popular re-occurring bit: The Masturbating Bear.The good news is, President Obama is finally sneaking into the monologues of hosts who once avoided it, albeit without much snap. Letterman noted that the shutdown was so bad, the President had to furlough his Mother In Law, while Conan said that for the Obamas\u2019 anniversary, Michelle gave the President adifferentkind of shut down.Jimmy Kimmel is a disappointment. Last night, the host of ABC\u2019sJimmy Kimmel Liveintimated that the takeover of the WWII monument was silly and that it was being protested by the Tea Party\u2013the same people he blamed for closing it.Wednesday\u2019sJimmy Kimmel Livefound the host claiming Congress intends to keep the Government closed unless Obamacare is defunded, which shows that Kimmel\u2019s writers haven\u2019t really been keeping up with the news. (It would be fun to send one of his gotcha cameras into his own writers rooms, and see how many of them could answer basic questions about the shut down.)You can really tell that the writers are rusty when it comes to political jokes. Fallon, Kimmel, and Letterman all made jokes about being able to finally cut off mattress tags. Leno, the only host who hasn\u2019t been avoiding material aimed at the current president, fired off some zingers. His writers areclearly the most solid:\u201cObamacare does cover carpal tunnel syndrome \u2026 the result of trying to get through the stupid Obamacare [web site],\u201d he said.Later, Leno mentioned how President Obama tried to excuse away the early glitches in Obamacare by comparing it to problems faced by Apple with some of its product launches.\u201cYou gotta remember, Apple has geniuses working there \u2026\u201d Leno said to hearty laughs and applause. \u201cThis is Washington.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) for his strategy to defund Obamacare, Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, accused Cruz last week of weakening the Republican Party. He said Cruz needed to apologize to Republicans who were supposedly misled about his strategy.\u201cTed Cruz is a very bright, very serious conservative, but in this case and in a couple of cases earlier, he doesn\u2019t think through things strategically,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cIf you do something, then what will Obama do in return? What would Harry Reid do in return? When you\u2019re playing chess, the other team gets to make a move too.\u201dAfter sayingthat Cruz was merely employing a \u201ctactic\u201d in other interviews, Norquist then called on Cruz to apologize for his \u201cstrategy.\u201d\u201cHe needs to apologize to all the Republicans who were misled about this strategy that he didn\u2019t implement,\u201d NorquisttoldNewsmax in an interview last week.Norquist also condescendingly said he felt Cruz is now \u201cwise and more experienced\u201d and he \u201cmay check with some other people\u201d and ask, \u201cHey, I have an idea, what do you think?\u201dHe may be willing to answer the question, which his staff wasn\u2019t, which his allies never did, which is, \u2018walk me through \u2026 we do this and the other team tries to punch us\u2019 \u2026 how do we get to where we\u2019re going, knowing that the other team, Obama and the Democrats and the establishment press, will be throwing marbles at our feet and lying about what we\u2019re doing all the way through it?What Norquist failed to mention was that establishment Republicans like himself also threw stones at Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), allowing the mainstream media and Democrats to cite them and pile on in their criticism of conservatives behind the defunding Obamacare strategy, which negatively impacted public opinion. In addition, he also failed to note that Cruz said Democrats from red states would be pressured more effectively if all Republicans were united behind the defunding Obamacare strategy from the beginning, which they never were.Establishment Republicans slammed Cruz on and off the record and only adopted his strategy after months of pressure from conservatives, which culminated in the Exempt America rally in Washington, D.C. that groups like Tea Party Patriots and ForAmerica organized. As Breitbart News has noted,\u00a0Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reformsupportedthe initial House\u201cgimmick\u201dfor a symbolic vote on Obamacare funding that conservatives revolted against\u00a0and which the House Republican leadership ultimately tabled.Norquist,\u00a0whoalso said Cruz led Republicans into traffic and wandered away,did not mince his words when he said, \u201cWe are weaker today because of what Ted Cruz did. That was unfortunate.\u201d\u201cWe need to learn from that, Ted Cruz needs to learn from that,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cRepublicans were misled into picking a specific fight rather than realizing this was a long-term conflict.\u201d", "parent_id": "", "parent_text": "", "comment_ids": "1075985737", "comment_texts": "This man is so irrelevant..it's better to ignore him.", "comment_date": "2013-10-09", "user_name": "1Tiamo", "topic": -1}

The hour-long affair was more like a conversation between the like-minded on issues such as the ongoing budget battles and going around Congress by raising the debt ceiling by executive fiat. Anyone who remembers the non-stop confrontation directed at President Bush just a few years ago, by this same group of reporters, would not recognize them today.Not a single reporter confronted Obama over the violent rhetoric he and his administration have been using to describe Republicans, or even the fact that as a Senator, Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling \u2014 a position he is now describing as dangerous, irresponsible and akin to hostage-taking.In fact, in this briefing, Obama used the words \u201chostage, insane, ransom, nuclear bomb, chaos, disaster.\u201dMark Knoller of CBS News is the only reporter that asked the president about the individual compromise spending bills the GOP have passed to fund the parks, veterans, and National Institutes of Health, among other items. Obama swatted away the question with talking points without being challenged on the fact that this veto threat means children suffering from cancer will not get treatment from the NIH.No reporter even asked about the ObamaCare launch debacle.Here are some of the questions that were asked:\u2014Julie Pace of APQ: Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously if Congress does pass a clean CR and a clean debt ceiling bill, those may just be short-term measures. If that happens, does your offer to negotiate with them on issues like health care and spending and deficit reduction still stand in the intervening weeks if they pass measures that are just perhaps six weeks or two months long?\u2014Julianna Goldman.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You laid out the economic consequences of default, but if we were to get to that point, would you prioritize and pay bondholders first to maintain the semblance of credit or \u2014 rather than Social Security recipients or military servicemen and women? And how would you go ahead and make that determination?\u2014Sam Stein, Huffington Post.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. With Speaker Boehner so far unwilling to hold a vote on a clean CR, what assurances can you give to those affected by a shutdown who are concerned about an even longer impasse? And how worried are you personally that your preferred solution to this clean CR and sequestration levels may do harm to the nation\u2019s economy and your second-term agenda?\u2014Roberta Rampton.Q: Thanks. You talked a bit about the hit to credibility around the world that this impasse has caused. I\u2019m wondering what you and your administration are telling worried foreign creditors, China and Japan, who are calling and then asking about whether the United States is going to avoid defaulting on its debts?\u2014Ari Shapiro.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the Supreme Court, and the term started today with a campaign finance case that sort of picks up where Citizens United left off. You called Citizens United devastating to the public interest, so I wonder if you could weigh in on this latest case.\u2014Respected members of the media also described the performance of their colleagues in the press corps as \u201cpathetic.\u201d\u2014\u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume)October 8, 2013\" data-btlnk=\"\n<p>Questions from WH press corps are pathetic.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who faces three challengers in next year\u2019s June primary.On Monday evening, the Greenville County, SC GOP executive committee, an official arm of the state\u2019s Republican Party,passeda 29-point censure of Graham\u2019s activities in Washington. \u201cInitially a voice vote was taken and newly elected County Chair Chad Groover ruled that the nays won, at which point there were several calls for \u2018division,'\u201d The South Carolina Conservative\u2019s Javan Browder wrote on Tuesday morning.\u00a0\u201cGroover recognized the call for division and a standing vote was taken, and the measure then passed by a convincing 53-26 margin.\u201dGreenville County\u2019s GOP executive committee is now the third official Republican Party outfit in South Carolina to pass such a resolution. It joinsChesterfield CountyandFairfield County, who passed similar resolutions in September.Polling data from Clemson University released in late September shows South Carolina GOP voters increasingly disapprove of Graham. \u201cRepublican Gov. Nikki Haley has a strong backing for reelection next year among GOP voters, while U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham will need to convince people in his party to give him another term, according to a new Clemson University poll,\u201d Andrew ShainwroteforThe State, a South Carolina newspaper, on Sept. 24.\u201cGraham, who is facing competition from the libertarian wing of the party in the June primary, was liked by 53 percent of those polled,\u201d Shain added. \u201cMore than one-third of GOP voters had an unfavorable opinion of the Seneca Republican.\u201dClemson University political scientist Dave Woodward suggests that Graham could be unseated by one of his three primary challengers: State Sen. Lee Bright, businesswoman Nancy Mace, or pro-life activist Richard Cash. \u201cRepublican primaries regularly attract about 20 percent of the registered voters, and they are more conservative and more ideological than voters in the general election,\u201d Woodard said. \u201cIt often happens that popular incumbents are derailed on the way to re-election by upstart challengers in GOP primaries.\u201d\u201cMost incumbents have a \u2018re-elect regardless\u2019 number in the 30s, so the governor\u2019s numbers are quite strong,\u201d Woodard added. \u201cThat cannot be said about Graham, his numbers show that more than two-thirds of the base GOP voters are unhappy with him.\u201dShain reports that the Clemson poll shows that while Graham would get 31 percent of the GOP vote in South Carolina\u2019s GOP primary if the vote were held now, at least 20 percent of Republican voters said they oppose his re-election.That polling data is an 11-point drop-off in support for Graham sincea poll released earlier in Septemberthat showed Graham with 42 percent of GOP voters supporting him in the primary. When that poll was released, South Carolina political prognosticators warned Graham he was in trouble.\u201cThese numbers should be of concern to the Graham campaign. The senator fails to reach 50% of the vote against any of his opponents,\u201d Rosetta Stone Communications president John Garst said at the time. \u201cGraham does not break 40% among voters who think of themselves as evangelistic conservatives, and that group makes up 58% of the primary electorate.\u201dNow, Graham is polling even lower among the state\u2019s GOP voters.All this news comes as various local Tea Party activists are getting more involved in the Graham race. Kershaw County Patriots, a Tea Party group, endorsed Graham challenger Lee Bright on Monday. In a video they publishedannouncing their endorsement of Bright, Kershaw County Patriots founders Jeff Mattox and Larry Risvold noted that they were \u201creally instrumental in the groundwork of getting Mick Mulvaney elected and John Spratt out of office.\u201d\u201cWe had a lot of success with that,\u201d Risvold says in the video. \u201cWe were in every county in the fifth district and actually developed a great relationship with all the other Tea Parties and conservative groups throughout the state.\u201d\u201cI think every day during that election cycle we were out doing something somewhere to affect people, to bring people in, to tell them what was going on and to get them involved, and we did it by making things fun,\u201d Mattox added. \u201cWe\u2019re about liberty. We\u2019re about individual liberty, the Constitution. And that\u2019s why we got so excited about it because it\u2019s time for us to [have] no more of these career politicians.\u201dThe Kershaw County Patriots endorsement stated they \u201cwill not be deterred, will not be afraid, and will not fail,\u201d and Bright said he \u201cexpects this to be the first of many Tea Party groups who will join us in our campaign.\u201d He added that \u201cwhen you look at my record, and my statements, it is easy to see that the Kershaw County Patriots and Lee Bright are on the same page. We are thrilled to get the first official Tea Party endorsement, and look forward to many more.\u201dSouth Carolina is technically a runoff state, so if the challengers work together to keep Graham under 50 percent, they can get to a runoff election with the candidate who comes in second challenging Graham. Conservatives point to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his election in Texas as an example of the model they plan to use to win. Cruz technically lost the primary to Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the establishment\u2019s pick for U.S. Senate, but he won in the ensuing runoff.", "parent_id": "", "parent_text": "", "comment_ids": "1076038058", "comment_texts": "Good!

Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and other Representatives pushing for immigration legislation that would legalize the status of America\u2019s at least 11 million illegal immigrants.In a public statement that will be released Thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, USCIS Council president Kenneth Palinkas warned that Goodlatte (pictured), House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-VA), House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA), and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) seem to be following the same pathway that Senate \u201cGang of Eight\u201d members did, regarding how they are working on immigration legislation.\u201cAt every step, this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation\u2019s security and the American taxpayer,\u201d Palinkas said.\u00a0\u201cI documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of Schumer-Rubio-Corker-Hoeven [S. 744] only to have them ignored.\u201cI worry the House may be following a similar path.\u00a0Media reports reveal that Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Chairman Paul Ryan, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally, in combination with proposals to expand visa programs.\u201dPalinkas warned, too, that any group of \u201cstep-by-step\u201d House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly whatHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,\u00a0Gang of Eight members Sens.Bob Menendez (D-NJ)andChuck Schumer (D-NY),Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,\u00a0andsome Republicanshave said they want to do.\u201cThese plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency \u2013 USCIS \u2013 that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card, temporary visa and citizenship applications,\u201d Palinkas said. \u201cAdvancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at USCIS would be to invite disaster.\u201dIn his statement, Palinkascited a recent MSNBC reportwhere Gutierrez said he, Goodlatte, and others have worked on a \u201ccompromise\u201d position. That MSNBC report also noted that Goodlatte and other Republicans are working with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), another Democrat, on a plan to get to conference with the Senate bill. Palinkas stated that USCIS agents have been, like they were from the Senate conversations, excluded from all discussions among House leaders. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t USCIS officers being consulted on this \u2018compromise\u2019 offer?\u201d Palinkas asked.He further expressed concern over Cantor\u2019s GOP DREAM Act, tentatively called the KIDS act. \u201cI am also worried about the arguments being used to support the KIDS Act, one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted,\u201d Palinkas said.\u00a0\u201cLegislators, including Mr. Cantor and\u00a0Mr. Goodlatte, have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens.\u00a0But if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens, then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently?\u201dHe warned that the KIDS Act may lead down a slippery slope. \u201cThis seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries,\u201d Palinkas asserted. \u201cShould we just expect that the next Secretary at DHS will use the arguments we are hearing in the House to enact the next Deferred Action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty?\u201dPalinkas alleged that, under the Obama administration, USCIS has been riddled with nefarious activities. \u201cAt USCIS, our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics, and I hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the House,\u201d he said.He finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped House Republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to: \u201cUSCIS adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits.\u00a0This includes the inability to conduct in-person interviews, the failure of our software system, the lack of training and office space, and pressure to rubber-stamp applications.\u00a0We have become an approval machine,\u201d \u201cFailure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits,\u201d \u201cAdministrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who, under law, are not properly eligible,\u201d \u201cApproval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them,\u201d \u201cA management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals, not US citizens and taxpayers, as the customer.\u00a0We believe in treating all with respect and always will, but our agency\u2019s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the American people.\u201dGoodlatte, Ryan, and Cantor are not the only Republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. According to theMiami Herald, Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) said about immigration: \u201cWe have to address it. It\u2019s a moral issue.\u201dIn addition,according toPolitico, House GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for House Republicans this year.This coming weekend on Univision, McMorris Rodgers will say that House Speaker John Boehner \u201cover the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the House moving forward on immigration reform.

Phil stated:When we prayed, we said, \u2018in Jesus\u2019 name, amen.\u2019 I don\u2019t have a verse that says you must always use pray in the name of Jesus, but it\u2019s a very good idea, I think. So they would have me say, \u2018Thank you, Oh Lord, for the food, thank you for the leavens, amen.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Why would you cut out \u201cin Jesus\u2019 name\u201d? And they said, \u2018Well, those editors are probably doing that, they think, you know, it might offend some of the Muslims, you know.\u2019I said, \u2018Let\u2019s see now. What year is it?\u2019 They said, \u2018What?\u2019 I said \u2018What year is it?\u2019 They said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s 2012.\u2019 I said \u20182012, AD, Anno Domini, the year of Our Lord.\u2019 I said, \u2018You Hollywood cats, you\u2019re counting time\u2026I would think, if we\u2019ve all decided in America to count time by just one of them, Jesus of Galilee\u2026I don\u2019t think it hurts to throw his name in there from time to time, your calendar is based on it.\u2019 They said, \u2018We never thought about that.\u2019 I said, \u2018Duh!\u2019 I said, \u2018Gimme a break!\u2019 So I notice now that every once in a while, they leave it in there.But you have to remember, spiritual warfare. You have people with no, what do they say, no moral compass. It ain\u2019t there. So what I tell people is be patient. Just be patient. We\u2019re working on it. We\u2019re working on it. We just have to do it. They\u2019re the ones who own the network\u2026.People have to understand, people of God have to understand, just be patient. You don\u2019t turn that ship quickly.
