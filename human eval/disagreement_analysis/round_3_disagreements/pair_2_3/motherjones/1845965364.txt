So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.

      Um, yes you can, if you reduce emergency room visits for non-emergencies by 1/3, as this article shows, among other cost saving features of the law.

          I never got to keep my doctor before. My company shopped for cheaper coverage every single year. MOST Americans never got to keep their doctor before. What fantasy world do you live in?

            You, like your Graven Idol, are a LIAR. I've had my doctor for over 20 years. NEVER had to change. If you're not lying, you stupidly work for the crappiest company in the history of the world.
