Wow, your post only solidifies how out of touch the rich (or perceived rich) are, when it comes to real issues. I really appreciate the stererotyping of the middle class...well done. You sound like a Medieval king talking about his plebes working in the fields outside your gate. So, I'm a middle class American with two professional degrees (that I paid for myself; daddy didn't prime the Alumni for my slot in college); I have a good job; a decent savings account, excellent credit, don't spend money on things unless I truly need them, don't drink or play the lotto, no big toys-boats, no big vacations, etc., etc. So, would you still call me one of those 'pissing and moaning' middle classers you know nothing about? You and your generation's greed is what is destroying this country from the inside out; not the fading middle class you are a part of destroying. Who is going to pick up the rich's tab, when the middle class is gone? Who will you blame then, for the failing status of this country's economy? Wake up and take a taste of reality brother. You have no clue what is really going on.

Anecdotes are not data.  Who cares who you personally know, have you done the research to show that this is a common behavior pattern in the middle class?  If not, shut up.  You have nothing to contribute.

Happy Valentine's Day my sweet grubbini! I adore you so. 

One of the reasons I love you, in addition to your lovely mullet, trim figure, and excellent fashion taste, is that you are delightfully dim. Never have to fear being intellectually intimidated around you. To wit: you confuse a rate with an amount, a difference you should have learned in third grade. If we go back to the Clinton era tax <b>rates</b> then the federal government will take in roughly 19% of GDP, significantly above the 14% it's taking in now. The <b> amount</b> of money taken in would be significantly above the Clinton era revenues, as would the amount the government spends, but that's because the overall economy is larger.

Now give me a smile and tell me you love me.

Taxing the Rich

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
You know what? I don't care.
Budget cuts, in general, will take money from the poor and middle-class. Income tax increases will take  money, in general, from the upper-middle-class and the rich.
Somewhere along the line, way too many people have concluded that somehow, taking a dollar from a rich guy somehow weakens the economy more than taking a dollar from a poor guy. It doesn't.
So I say: Share the pain. Tax the rich.

 We LOWERED capital gains tax to 15% and guess what?  The economy STILL tanked.  Putting it to zero would do what additional things that substantial lowering didn't do?  Theoretically, lowering it would have had a substantial economic effect, which of course it did:  it made rich people richer.  But that wasn't the argument:  the argument was that it would increase investment.  Which it didn't.

In conclusion, absolutely NO tax expenditures on the rich have any effect on the economy except to divert money to the parasitic rich from the people who actually create value:  the workers.

The Bane of Animal Rescue Shelters

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I really do fear that people are going to read Kevin's post and the comments and think that all groups are like this.  My partner and I adopted a cat from the NYC ASPCA adoption truck with very little fuss -- a very brief application to show that we had the financial wherewithal to take care of the cat and not much more.   Took maybe an hour.  And yes, we both work all day.  It was an appropriate level of screening, and they were frankly thrilled that we took the cat (she was 10 years old at the time, her prospects for adoption were obviously somewhat limited).  So please, everyone, be patient and don't give up on rescuing an animal rather than purchasing from a pet store!

If you do research even using Google, you will find that in marginal areas (brush and scrub) feral and domestic cat predation may be considered to be significant factors in the decrease in passerine bird population, primarily through nest predation.

Mackey has learned nothing or maybe simply chooses to ignore history (as a for instance: robber barons destroying communities and killing workers in the name of profits, something that every libertarian should encourage, I guess); reality (socialism is a failure everywhere, except in Europe, for instance); science (climate change is not occurring at a sedate pace that allows us to easily adapt, so are the current yearly disasters similar to other disasters that would occur once in a few hundred years).  In fact, he is downright shamefully ignorant.  Another rich guy makes it thanks to his family and then tells us how he manfully wrested his success from the evil gubmint.  I am sure he never used any government programs, facilities or roads, railroad tracks, FDA inspections etc to assure his own success.

something that can be empirically disproven, instead it's taken as 
axiomatic. This kind of thinking is far too commonplace in economics 
departments, not just here but in a wide variety of other things. In 
many ways, modern economics is closer to a religion than a science.

# News comment title:
Climate Change Will Make It Harder For Us to Adapt to.....Climate Change

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
More climate change scaremongering.

Here's the truth. The climate change models CANNOT predict regional variations in precipitation accurately. They CANNOT tell you if an area will get more or less rainfall due to global warming.

All of the above outtakes in Kevin's figure are due to decreased water availability. Climate change could just as easily INCREASE regional water supplies, making it easier to produce electricity.

Climate Change scaremongering helps no one.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Exactly right.  My wife keeps telling me we should save more for retirement, but I tell her she is scaremongering because it's just as likely that I will  HIT IT BIG as it is that we will be eating CATFOOD when we are old.  So saving money helps NO ONE.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


 Actually it was called Climate Change (IPCC--I actually worked on research for projects related to this) well before the Koch brothers came to our attention. This was because, ta da, not everywhere would there be equivalent warming.  Some places might get colder; some weather might get more drastic, etc.  So Climate Change is more accurate.  That the overall trend is global warming is undeniable.

Well, the Tea Party IS the John Birch Society, just rebranded (Fred Koch, founder of Koch Industries, was one of the founding members, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society). The Koch brothers just revamped it a little and sprinkled fairy dust on it to make it seem otherwise

I have no idea what fantasy planet you're living on- Bankrate.com lists the best savings account rate as 0.9%, with 1 year CDs in a similar range.  To get close to 2% you have to do a 5 year CD with minimum $25k.  So not really going to work for a family trying to scrape together $300.

I have finally decided that to the Right, racism is actions, not attitude, behavioral patterns or words. If they allow persons of color in their stores, they are ipso facto not racists, even as they watch them the whole time they are in the store and miss the white shoplifters right next to them. That to them is not racism, it is ""common sense because them colored folks are more likely to commit crimes"". They can claim that one of their best friends is a person of color because they talk to that person with conscious courtesy and fail to notice the unconscious condescension in their own manner.  And so on.

I gagged several times at Brooks' imperious, arrogant, elitist attitude. But my overall reaction was more mundane--isn't Brooks one of the people who rail against laws that attempt to legislate behavior and attitudes? In other words, isn't his stance this time more than a little hypocritical?

The Great Recession Is Still Going Strong for Young Men

I wonder what would happen if you broke out the number for the young by race as well.  I suspect a lot of that number could be explained by large numbers of young black men being jobless.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
How about the end of good jobs for both men and women. Women are still underemployed and always have been, and men are trending towards that mean.  To paint this as a unique problem for men is to understate the reality that both face.  

The lumpenproletariat is growing.This is the real problem.

# News comment title:
Chart of the Day: Everyone Agrees That Iraq Was a Disaster

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The GOP won the 2002 elections. They won -- barely --  the 2004 elections. America was rescued, for a while, from the twin scourges of gay marriage and slightly higher top rates of income tax.

Since the war was basically the world's most expensive campaign commercial anyways --remember, all the <I>great</i> presidents are wartime presidents -- I wouldn't say it was a disaster.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
that's not even close to being true.

at the least, you're off by a factor of four. at worst, you're off by a couple orders of magnitude (counting for interest on the money borrowed to pay for it)

debt service for 2013 was about <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfinger/2013/10/04/the-u-s-debt-ceiling-fallacy-agreement-or-not-there-will-be-no-default/"">$420B</a>


we've already spent $1.7T on the war, and continued veterans' support along with the interest we will accrue to pay that off could push the total to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-iraq-war-cost-2-trillion-2013-3"">over $4T</a>. maybe even as high as $6T.

What I find interesting about the Koch op-ed is the repeated concern about ""disrespect"". Not only is it a subjective metric - which allows the charge to be made against any opponent - we should remember that ""respect"" is a hallmark of hierarchical societies that dates back (at least) to the Middle Ages and is fully congruent with contemporary conservative thought.

# News comment title:
Why Are We All So Obsessed With Inflation?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The 1970s were a lost decade in so many ways, a massive letdown from the 1960s bereft of good music, saddled with non-innovation (8-track tapes!!) and none of the rebound seen in the 1980s. The 1990s were good. The aughts were not. This decade is doing better, but not enough yet.

Well, it was a short term place to dump money I got fortuitously.  My other pension setup is much better.  But you can only put X amount into retirement plans, and the rest needs to be put somewhere....really sucky

Meet the New Super Working Class

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
There is a huge difference between working say in a factory that produces rubber products; dealing with toluene and other chemicals and being a lawyer. The physical demands are not comparable. OI know. I did both. Being a lawyer, I job I enjoyed beat the hell our of packing, cutting, and preparing rubber products. even if the jobs paid the same, there is no way I work 12 hours a s a rubber plant worker; while I routinely did 12 hours as a lawyer.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Back in the 1950s, bankers followed the ""3-6-3"" rule:  pay 3% interest on deposits, charge 6% interest on loans, and hit the golf course by 3PM.

Banking was safe, boring and modestly profitable.  Then we convinced ourselves that ""greed is good"" and everything changed.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


I would like to submit that there is a substantial change in what is called work. Except for programmers, artists etc who get lost in their work, most ""hard working"" folks spend huge amounts of time flapping their lips in meetings, on the phone, online etc with stuff like twitter and so forth. The Big Bosses also flap their lips irrelevantly over lunches, after work drinks, early breakfasts etc. What I can easily accomplish with 2 emails takes them 4-6 hours to do, thanks to the endless jabber.

Which is probably why so many of them are checking their cell phones and tablets during said meetings, tweets, and meals

There'll come a day when the fog of hatred and bitterness clears and you reflect upon the way you've lived your life. It'll be important to face the whole thing bravely and honestly. Be sure to remember that, when you saw desperate children fleeing deprivation and violence, your first thought was to put land mines in their path.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Only poor people buy generics, doctors aren't poor, therefore doctors don't buy generic.  It's the look of the thing around here.  I don't know anyone who makes a middle class wage (over 100000 around here) that buys generic Advil, Tylenol, etc.  It wouldn't do to drop little Joni off at school and have to give her an Advil in the car for cramps only to look over and see the lady in the Porsche next to you can see your ugly generic bottle.  Or that's what the middle class people tell me here where I work.  Along with things like ""I'd never go to a discount store.  You never know who might be there."" and ""omg, didn't you feel dirty when they saw that shirt from Target??"".  gems.

Maybe its my scottish heritage talking here, but the idea of being embarrassed to be seen taking 15 seconds to save 50+% on an otherwise identical item at the grocery store is just preposterously alien to me.



And seriously, the best way I've found to make a good impression on clerks is to make eye contact, treat them like genuine human beings, and thank them sincerely for their assistance.  How insecure do you need to be to imagine that the hypothetical evaluations of people scanning your keychain and pain killers for class discrepancies are important factors to consider in determining your behavior?



Maybe *I'm* the alien.  Who knows?

So many people peering into your beemer to see what your pain killer is like, so little time

It seems to me that there is a positive trend amongst the marthastewart cognoscenti to go shopping at target to get a really super deal on stuff that you only wear a couple of weeks anyhow.

Chart of the Day: The Horrible Toll of the Recession on the Poor

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Thats the hope and change we got.  The rich got richer.  And the fed is still pumping.  anyone notice the price of food?  Now they are talking of stoping the pumping and raising rates.  How will that work?  How will it be for the lowest quintile.  I would also point out that this chart doesnt show the fact that that lowest quintile has grown more than all the others as far as percentage of population.  But then again, the ones from the top two quintiles fund the politicians, so the politicians set up the game for payback.  this is like a economic version of systematic racism.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Millions more paid exploding college tuition bills, paid medical bills, or paid for long-term care for elderly parents, covered for a layoff or hours reduction, or just struggled to compesate for the gap between stagnant or worse salaries and inflation -- albeit general CPI wasn't increasing that fast, it was above trend, even far above trend, some sectors, like medical and post-secondary education

The notion that everyone cashed out, bought matching snow machines, put in a pool and went to Cancun is a nice cartoon.

Friday Cat Blogging - 5 September 2014

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Kevin, I'm so so very sorry. I have truly enjoyed all your Domino photos and stories since I started reading your blog. I lost my own 20-year-old cat last year around this time and I still miss her dearly. But you and I both have wonderful photos and memories. Thank you for sharing yours with us. Best, Nara.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
So sorry to hear this, Kevin.  To have lost both Domino and Inkblot in such a short time must doubly hurt.

It's only been six weeks since we had to have our 16 year old cat put to sleep, after a similar progression.  When he wouldn't eat dry food, we gave him tuna; when he wouldn't eat tuna anymore, we squeezed out tuna juice for him to drink; when he wouldn't drink the tuna juice anymore, and then within a day of that, wouldn't even drink water, we knew that was it.  (Thyroid issues were his undoing, too.)

But he was the world's sweetest, most affectionate cat, right up to the end.

I commiserate with you.  My cat has terminal kidney failure, and I know it is a question of time.  It takes courage to do the sad final chore for your pet.

The way technology encourages the curmudgeonly elements of people is one of the more unexamined ways it is impacting society.  Kevin, you sometimes seem like you're the early picture on an evolutionary chart of humanity heading toward Asimov's ""Naked Sun"" future.

Good luck with that.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
OTOH the people below trying to blame conservatives for not paying attention, are the epitome of liberal arrogance. Gruber is the poster boy for elitist authoritarianism by hook or crook. Reminds me of the Clinton's argument against a tax cut... the money people get to keep wouldn't be spent properly. This is socialism, the politically connected telling people what to do because the citizens are too stupid to appreciate the evils visited upon them.

A republic is a form of government in which power resides in the people,[1] and the government is ruled by elected leaders run according to law (from Latin: res publica), rather than inherited or appointed (such as through inheritance or divine mandate). In modern times the definition of a republic is also commonly limited to a government which excludes a monarch. Wikipedia.


So, oh mighty brainiac, what the hell is the difference between a representative democracy and a republic, that which the Republicans get so het up about?

??? Are you saying the energy systems are fascist? And I came very close to the proper definition by intelligent deduction, so my argument isn't silly. Gratuitous insults are not a form of argument, they are just a way of blocking ears and yelling ""nanner nanner nanner you don't use my jargon in the way I do therefor I dismiss what you say"".

# News comment title:
Why Did the Enclosed Mall Die?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Perhaps they were just overbuilt. I lived in the St. Louis area in the late 80s, where there were at least a dozen enclosed malls. One of those, on the far edge of an outlying suburb, closed in the early 90s while another was being remodeled into a mostly outdoor mall.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
This is an area I have some expertise.
Began working for DeBartolo Properties Management at the beginning of the 90's.  Was swept up in the Simon /Debartolo merger of 94 - 95.  Stayed with Simon until 2002 when it was clear malls were going the way of the Dodo bird. Note, Simon is still one of the largest retail REIT's in the market.

While I think all of your speculation Kevin, played a role in the demise of the mall, the biggest culprit to me was money.  In the mid to late 90's, a class A property (we classify retail properties using a A - F designation, with F being the worst) could see $55 - $60 SF for a decent to prime location within the mall.  Compare that to $20 - $25 SF of a class A strip mall cost in today's dollars.

The business model of the mall was hemorrhaging cash when the economy began to turn in the late 90's.  Vacancies were up, tenants were re-negotiating their leases and we could not attract new tenants due to the cost.

Also, with the crazy retail days of the mid 90's, there was not any new trends or retailers that were making waves at the beginning of the aughts.  So a combination of a saturated market, no innovation or new players and the prohibitive costs of leasing a covered mall was the 3 nails in the coffin to this business model.

# News comment title:
President Obama Starts to Focus on the Middle Class

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Good. I hope that this catches fire with the rest of the Democratic Party. It doesn't go far enough, but I strongly support free and universal secondary schooling. Hell, I think that people who are enrolled full-time in uni should be getting at least minimum wage.


It's honestly our only way forward. Economic centrism is both bad politics and bad policy and only sows the seeds for the next conservative revolt.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Before Gov. Reagan, California had free college tuition for all students.  That just might be one of the reasons why that state led the union in economic progress for so many years.

# News comment title:
Scott Walker Is Still Clearly a Work in Progress

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
At least Jeb comes off as human.  Walker has the cold, dead eyes of a cheap android.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
While Paul Ryan has the limpid blue ones of a dreamy prom date!  Errrr... scratch that. If you saw his interview on Meet the Press you know he has the glassy-eyed look of a delusional cult member, which is exactly what he is. 

Walker's problem, like Ryan's, is that he spends so much time around bobble-headed like-minded true believers that he's caught in the ""epistemic closure"" bubble the far right started creating after the ""Gingrich revolution"" — remember that the Newtster and his gang openly posited that he was going to run the country from the Speakership — with the process being completed by Roger Ailes and FAUX News. Isolated from conflicting opinions, or even nuanced thinking, Walker is caught flat-footed by something so basic as asking him to define the terms he spouts. Kevin is likely right, he'll get coached up and learn to obfuscate when speaking to the general public — even village idiot Ted Cruz has made progress on that front – but make no mistake, it will be barely a patina over the whole mess o' crazy that constitutes the modern day GOP base.

# News comment title:
The Hack Gap Lives!

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I still maintain it was a leak from the Clinton side to get the (potential) bad news out before formally announcing her candidacy. This will be litigated in the press, probed by Gowdy and nothing will come of it as she broke no laws. I love American politics!

Glad you're back, Kevin. Hope you're feeling much better.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I just wish there was some better reporting on the details.  Everything I've read so far seems to lack critical details needed to make a judgement about how big an issue this is.  Where was this really hosted, how good was the security, what were the standards in determining which emails had to be provided for government archiving, why did Clinton use a private server instead of the state dept.  My default after decades of GOP cultivation of fake Clinton ""scandals"" is to presume this is more hyped up nonsense, but I hope some intrepid, tech savvy journalist continues digging.

update: a couple minor details i found.  I looked up the history of the clintonemail.com domain and it was originally registered in 2009 by Justin Cooper, an adviser to Bill CLinton who, according to wikipedia, ""began working in the White House as an intern in the Office of Science and Technology Policy and later in the Oval Office. He was later hired as a Staff Assistant for Oval Office Operations."" Today it's registration info is shielded by a middleman company called PERFECT PRIVACY, LLC. Not anything revelatory, but I hadn't seen that detail reported yet so I figured I'd write a quick post about it. I also noticed a traceroute dies at a zayo.com router, a company which provides "" bandwidth infrastructure services, including dark fiber, wavelengths, SONET, Ethernet, IP services, and carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection."".

She ""destroyed the bad ones"" would be in effect regardless of where her email was stored or what email system she used. Voir Benghazi and the IRS ""scandal"" (yes I know the IRS ""scandal"" wasn't HRC but it was an email ""question"").

There are a whole lot of people out there who think email storage is infinite and perpetual.  Only the NSA has that capability.  Even magnetic archiving is prone to flaws and errors, which increase as the media ages.

Why Leftover Pasta Might Be Healthier Than Fresh

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Why is this hilarious? It misses the point.


OMG there are sooooo many obese Thais/Chinese subsisting on rice.


Carbs ain't the problem.


It's all the fat/processed food/sugars.


Sugar+fat = diabetes.
Sugar+fat+no exercise = CHD, weight gain.


High carbs, low fat, low protein, vegan? No worries.


(And, 30 mins exercise a day).

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
There r three different metabolic types, sounds like you do better on vegetable carbs. I need a lot of healthy fats to feel my best. There never was any science behind ""low fat"" craze. On the contrary, it has been a health disaster. And fat cannot ever make you fat. It's the sugar in all its 50+ different names, that is making people fat and sick. I can recall being sick maybe twice in 15 years. Not at all in the last 5 or so after I fully understood my body. Take vitamin d, eat according to your metabolic type, less than 25 grams of sugar. No worries.

If You Want to Be Part of the Top 1%, You'd Better Be Working For a Top 1% Firm

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Interesting, and confirms anecdotal evidence. In technology, for example, Google pays above average wages. So does Facebook. Companies that are #4 or below relative to their competition pay much less.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Just a reminder that we don't have a problem with poverty in this country. We have a problem with distribution. We can feed, clothe, and house everyone. We choose not to do it.

Are these ""high performing"" or ""high recognition brand name"" firms? Among the top 1%, the brand or family connection means a whole lot more than does the quality of the person or the product.

There have been really significant advances in cancer therapies over the past year or so, particularly in how cancers and things like herpes virus evade the immune system.

But, right now, cheer yourself up by turning on the tv and watch Rick Perry's announcement speech!

I have not seen anyone sweat that much since Nixon! Perry and everyone in the crowd are inundated with sweat.

Here's Why Libertarians Are Mostly Men

libertarianism is often used as an excuse to opt-out of having to give a crap about those who don't already have it good: minorities, women, etc..

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Sorry, but libertarians might or might not care for the weak, depending on their capacity for empathy or level of sociopathy, so society has an interest in promulgating forced 'taking' to at least guarantee the continuation of society.  For instance, there are all sorts of 'takings', such as through laws forcing parents to support their children, taxes forcing someone to take care of the poor and insurance requirements forcing you to spread the risk of catastrophy over a large group. Only  a person of diminished mental or moral capacity would argue that caring should be left to the tender mercies of libertarians. Review the tragedy of the Ik.

# News comment title:
Greece Now Has to Decide Whether to Leave the Euro. It's Noit a No-Brainer.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
There is one thing that gives me pause when thinking about devaluing the New Drachma to export success - will the population accept it? Make no mistake, this is something new and dangerous, as the Greek finance minister himself pointed out a few years back. The Greek government would be creating a new currency just to make it worth less than it was mere weeks earlier by devaluation, and this in a country that already has issues with tax evasion and a large shadow economy sector. There will certainly be a thriving sector in black market Euros.

It will also ultimately be dependent on how good Greece's governance is during the suffering. Argentina did the default-and-devalue route, but it eventually turned into hyper-inflation and problems again because they weren't willing to try and get the fundamentals right after growth was restored.

Actually you mean leave the European Union. They can keep the euro as a currency, similarly to the many countries that use the US dollar as a currency (say Ecuador) or a quasi currency (say Belize).

# News comment title:
Greece vs. Germany: Behind a Veil of Morality vs. Technocracy, the Germans are Winning the War of the Narrative

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I read a lot about how they got here but very little about the path forward.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
One would think that if there were any nation on Earth whose bankers had a visceral understanding of the damage that can be done by creditor nations demanding unsustainable debt payments, it would be Germany.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


If I am to trust the commentary from the folks (relatives and acquaintances) in Europe, most people think the Germans are purely awful.  This may have something to do with the fact that they had to fight them off multiple times; the notion of happy go lucky Greeks is a fabrication of the English speaking press.

Meet the Engineer Who Forced Silicon Valley's Gender Problem Into the Open

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The flip side of this problem is the type of males drawn to IT. Their skill sets are generally limited to coding. They fare poorly in social interaction. A disproportionate number are libertariloon. Male geeks can't deal with women by design. Exceptions define the rule.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Rubs eyes.  Where the f*^*k in Silicon Valley did you work?  


I've been in this field for over 30 years, too.  Men generally assumed I was a secretary.  Clients sexually harassed me and thought I was stupid or was some kind of servant.  One even threw a manual at me and told me to look something up.


The industry is loaded with knuckle-dragging mouth-breathers.


It has been getting better - but, then, I've been getting older; maybe I'm now too old for the type of crap I had to put up with in my 20's and 30's.

You are talking about a tribal culture that is self-reinforcing. Being a largely self-taught IT person, I have often been the only woman in the classroom, seminar, meeting, etc. It has been weird. I am close to retirement, but I am finding the (contract)engineers I work with are less and less cheeto eaters and more real humans. Progress is slow but possible

LOL. Oh sure, he's just playing eleventyseven dimensional chess while everyone else is too stupid to understand his big complicated supergenius game. Like those Congressional Dems are going to override a veto unless Obama stirs up the hornets' nest. Sure, ok. It's also possible that he thinks he actually did something worthwhile for once and wants to keep bragging about it.

The strategy Kevin outlined is simple and straightforward enough.  Whether that accurately portrays the President's strategy is another story.

You need to read some more current literature, not the stuff that men use to pat themselves on the back with.  There is no discernible difference in male/female math ability until the teens, when peer pressure, shaming, etc kick in full force, and women are expected to defer to men in the classroom, etc. etc. Also, girls are not more accurate, they are more likely to underestimate their abilities and fail to try (see the toys they are given!)

What's Next For Black Lives Matter?

Sounds like a bunch of people who were more interested in 15 seconds of fame than advancing their agenda. 

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
You've got to read the subtexts.


""Black Lives Matter"" means ""Black Lives <em>should</em> Matter, but in our current system they do not."" It's a demand for equality, and since we're a long way from that point, it's a heavy, but entirely just, demand.


""White Lives Matter"" or ""All Lives Matter"" on the surface seems innocent enough, which is why politicans can blunder into it. But the subtext is ""You're already equal. Quit yer bitchin'.""


""Black Lives Matter"" is a challenge to the status quo. ""All Lives Matter"" is a defense of the status quo.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


So I went back and reviewed the  supposed fiasco between Bernie Sanders and BlackLivesMatter.  Only in your wildest dreams was that a fiasco for Sanders.  He might have wanted to stay on the topic he was supposed to speak on, but so do most speakers.  And the behavior of the corporate kleptocracy is part of our problem, because it actively promotes dissension and pits us against each other, so much so that we cannot see that black lives matter too, and they need to be regarded as part of what needs to be fixed.  White people need to stop focussing their rage on black people and start looking closely at who benefits from all this intra-class warfare. What purpose is served by creating and maintaining a infra-underclass?  In every country there is a group of people who are the ""untouchables"" but we must ask why there are untouchables in the first place, and why we are so bent on having people to demonize, instead of working to create the land of liberty and justice for all?

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


I hate to point you in the direction of real research, but if you bother, you will find that the strongest determinant of ""crime"" is socio-economic status, not race.  Also, the fact that most white crime (theft, fraud, etc) doesn't fall in the descriptor of ""violent"" crime, it doesn't get reported as ""crime"" in most statistics, and results in lower rates of incarceration, although the extent of victimization is greater in fraudulent activity than one-on-one violent crime. Also, most crime resulting in incarceration committed by poorer people tends to be drug related non-violent crime, and gets reported whereas fraud etc doesn't. So, the crime statistics are seriously distorted by what we choose to call a crime.

Think about it.

# News comment title:
Will the Tea Party Shoot Itself in the Foot Yet Again?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
this exact scenario is why Republicans often with the governorship in Massachusetts. There are so many Democrats (the legislature is currently 159-41, the governor's council is 7-1, and all statewide offices except the gov and LG are D's) that they tear each other apart and spend a ton of money in the primary, so a moderate Republican (who has been running solo for months) ends up sweeping them. However, when the Dems coalesce quickly around a candidate, they're unstoppable.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Weirdly, I think Citizens United is making this situation worse for Republicans.  There are lots of candidates in this field because one rich guy wants his point of view out there, and they will stay in the field as long as the candidate keeps getting press and invited to debates.   


For instance, Rick Santorum and Foster Friess.

# News comment title:
The New York Times Needs to do a Better Job of Explaining Its Epic Hillary Clinton Screw-Up

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
When this fiasco became clear, I said that I'd judge the times by whether it outed the source who burned it, so they failed on that score.

As to why they ran with it? At heart, most national political journalists think they're better people than the politicians they cover.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
When has ever a tip from the Republican House investigative committees not turned out false?

The coal industry has seen the 'renewable' writing on the wall now for quite sometime. They ought to have thought about making some kind of capital investment in it during that meantime. Their fail to keep up with the times is on them and nobody else. Seeing McConnell being snuffed from his trophy of political capital by a black man in the White House....priceless!

# News comment title:
Can Republicans Get Millennials to Hate Hillary Clinton?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I'm not sure most millennials have the attention span to listen to an explanation of who Vince Foster was, much less the evidence that Hillary killed him. 

Snark aside, the accusations against her were all completely deranged, and I can't see them seeming less deranged now outside the fever-swamp context in which they were hatched.


To the extent that millennials are developing a negative impression of her, I suspect it's the insider/political hack/cozy with Wall Street kind of thing. And that's what I suspect the Republicans (who are, as ever, impervious to irony) will try to use against her.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
The causation provided is backwards, people don't hate HRC because of Whitewater or Travelgate or Benghazi!, they hate HRC first and then find justification for their hatred, that's how people work. So retreading those stories will not have much of an impact.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Who, the Republicans? Sure, that cash would feel very nice in my wallet too. If they can get millennials to do the work, I think we will see the biggest pile of snark and shrugs in the universe.

Well, let's see how much misinformation one person can pack into two sentences.  First, the spill was accidental, clearly.  Second, the spill was discharged into the Animas River, not the Colorado, and has been diluted to the point of invisibility before even reaching the Colorado.  And guess what?  The President WAS NOT doing the clean-up preparation the EPA was involved in at the Gold King Mine.  If you think somehow the POTUS is involved in the day to day activities of each and every government agency, you must believe he has superpowers.  Since the EPA immediately shouldered the blame, absolutely no-one is attempting to place blame on the GOP.  What a silly assumption.

That is correct. Also, most people don't realize that the Administrators are always talking about an event that will occur 30 years from now...and now....and now...which is why my generation sucked it up and put more of our income into SocSec...you know, the money used to provide tax breaks to the wealthy under Bush II? Which is another reason there is this fever dream of dismantling SocSec. Moar moneez for the poor little rich folks who can never have enough....the poor folks already can do without, so why can't they do without more?

Somebody, I forget who, made the intelligent observation that the GOP is basically a commercial entertainment enterprise with a sideline in politics. You have your Fox, Talk Radio and don't forget your books. All generating big bucks. The Dems have nothing like this. So those people on the debate stage, they're not so much running for president as auditioning for their own TV show or next blockbuster book deal.

# News comment title:
Blaming Culture Is a Liberal Thing? Seriously?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
There's nothing wrong with blaming culture in abstract for social ills. The reason why we liberals mock conservatives is because conservatives tend to have, at best, shaky correlation and commonsense prejudices to back up their accusations -- not to mention holding onto these explanations even when a much-better supported explanation is found such as the lead-crime hypothesis.


A conservative blaming violent video games or a lack of prayer in the school isn't even in the same ballpark as a feminist decrying rape culture for the alarmingly high incidence of rape in American society. Because feminists actually have a little thing called, you know, <i>empiricism</i> on their side.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
on a related note, can the media stop referring to the postmortem ranting of every lunatic murderer as a ""manifesto"".  he's not a god damned philosopher just because he killed people.  thanks in advance, reporters.

Well, if they're explaining how caffeine stops headaches: aren't those headaches made from HUMANS and deserve to LIVE?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I think it's also important to remember that lots of things that on balance are necessary or good are also distasteful or repulsive, e.g., end-of-life decisions, various gastro-intestinal procedures.
 
And I'm amused that the bomb-the-brown-savages-back-to-the-Stone-Age crowd has suddenly decided that <i>legal</i> medical procedures conducted with <i>full information and consent</i> are suddenly so icky and awful that they run for the fainting couches.  Wadda buncha cowards!

Same phenomenon as the widespread perception that crime is getting worse when in fact it's getting better, thanks to the blood-and-violence focus of nightly news programs.  And more generally, the ""Fox Effect.""  Add confirmation bias to the mix, and presto, more information actually makes you less informed!
 
Of course, the answer is not ""less information""; the answer is, better critical interpretation and reasoning skills.  And yet, for some reason, the political system continues to under-fund public education.  Now why do you suppose that might be?

No, it is far more common than people realize, as I found out from this article:http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/04/03/176145911/side-effects-prompt-patients-to-stop-statins-cholesterol (there are a lot moreartcles out there). I was almost crippled, and went through physical therapy and shoe inserts  until I found out hideous muscle pain can be a side effect. I was lucky that I recovered within weeks. People should know that red yeast rice can have the same effects.

# News comment title:
The Conservative Tax Borg Has Finally Absorbed Donald Trump

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Take away point for the readers: ALL taxes are wealth taxes.  You always pay every tax from your accumulated wealth.  The ""name"" given to a tax just describes the means used to make you liable for the tax, and the means by which a tax will be calculated.


Thus, for example, when you choose to by a new high tech widget (perhaps a Spacley Sprocket), you become liable to tap into your wealth to pay taxes calculated on the value of the widget.  The trigger is that you took a cash asset and chose to replace cash with a different type of asset.  The trigger is your decision to convert the form of your assets.  The amount of wealth you pay in tax is calculated by the value of the widget.


All other taxes work the same.  Every tax is a wealth tax.  People fight about the trigger and about the means of calculation so they can conceal the total amount of wealth you are taxed each year.  By dividing the taxes up into small bites they assume you won't calculate the total.  They also use a variety of triggers to shape behavior.


If people wanted tax transparency, they would dump all taxes and replace them with one single unitary wealth tax.

# News comment title:
Sorry, I Don't Know Why Murder Rates Are Up In a Bunch of Big Cities

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Petulant cops are staging a national work slowdown because they've been called out for murdering unarmed suspects. Ohio is an open carry state but a black man holding a toy gun in Walmart isn't given a chance to explain himself before being gunned down. 12 year old boys? No problem if they 'look like adults'. Just drive up and blow them away. Cops aren't accustomed to accountability. Police unions in NYC and Seattle have been reactionary. More murders increases perceived value of cops. Or so they think.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Personally, I think that the crime drp in the 90's corresponds to the huge increase of abortion accessibility in the 70's. As better pictures of fetuses has become available, there has been a corresponding decrease in the way most people feel about abortions. Increasingly state legislature has made abortions harder to get, and in some states, nearly impossible for the poor. I think this is the 20 year back swing og decreasing abortions. Just a thought. I think the book Freakanomics by Levitt discussed abortion and subsequent crime decrease connection.

Sort of a fact free assertion. How do you know men don't murder other men when their families are hungry? How do you know what the limits to a person's tolerance for despair are? Do you do anything besides listen toyYour favorite teevee channels ? When was the last time you walked in the inner city and didn't suffer a pang of shame that your fellow Americans could be living in such squalor ?

I'm still trying to figure out how all those 'supporters' swallowed that response to the Favorite Bible Verse question. Are they REALLY that gullible? Private, my @ss. Didn't all that Bible School teach you anything?! (lol. Unless the response really was the Eye for an Eye verse)

The iPad Pro Is Lacking One Thing If It Wants to Play in the Business World

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
if you want a tablet with a keyboard and connections for peripherals so you can work with it exactly as if you were using a traditional computer, you don't want a tablet; you want a laptop.

(which does bring us back to the question of who exactly Apple sees as the target for the giant iPad)

<blockquote>Apple has been playing catch-up for a while now. </blockquote>


I hesitate to wade into this but....


""Catch-up"" isn't really the right term here.  Apple typically seems to do one of two things.  First, it will essentially invent a product category (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch).  When rivals come in with a competing product, they use a kitchen-sink approach on features that Apple doesn't have as a way of differentiating themselves, irrespective of whether these features are implemented well.  Apple will then start adding some of those feature sets when it feels like it can do so in a way that is integrated with their product vision.  


iPhone screen-size is a good example.  It's not like nobody at Apple thought about making screens bigger than the original iPhone until Samsung came along; they just didn't want to do so until they could integrate a larger screen with other hardware that conformed to the ultra-thin design that Apple favors, along with OS upgrades that made good use of the extra size.


I don't think either approach (Samsung or Apple) is better than the other.  It's just a difference values.  And, luckily, people now get to choose which approach they like better.

It isn't a claim: ""slut-shaming"": by Limbaugh, Atkins immortal claim that rape babies don't exist, trying to keep women from buying contraceptives, trying to shut down family planning services, etc etc. Just because Palin, Schlafly, Fiorina etc are part of the cohort doesn't change the reality. Some slaves turned in their runaway companions to curry favor with their masters, and some women will act against other women to get the approval of men.

I feel that the non-voluntary contribution of the profits generated by my labor or by my consumption of a product to support a position against my morals is coercion too.I would hate to have to work for the Koch companies (as many people do in mining towns) and know that my work is used to support creeps like Walker.

Two Questions About Hillary Clinton's Email Server

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The most likely explanation is that the people in whatever State Department office it is that handles FOIA requests did not at first realize Hillary's email address did not lead to a dot gov server.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
That's just it.  There is no ""worst case scenario"" because this has always been an ""investigation"" in search of a crime.  Ask any conservative you know the following question:  what laws do you think Hillary Clinton broke?  They'll sputter and rage about her getting four people killed in Benghazi (and you have to explain there was no stand down order found by any of the other 8 investigations), but they can't actually name any of the heinous crimes she's supposed to have committed.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


No, in the world of DNS, .gov is reserved fro government servers.  Her personal address would be something else.  But she would email to .gov addresses. Hence her personal email would be traceable due to the wrapper on email she sent from her server to addresses on the .gov server.

Ah, yes, the many right wing people and anti-Muslim people proving the kid didn't assemble something because he couldn't possibly have got parts and put them together, and this was all a con because the deniers got the time line all messed up and proved that the kid really was trying to make everyone nervous about a bomb.  You guys are pathetic.

Rich people don't get most of their wealth from inheritance!
True - but why?
And the answer is that they get their wealth from their families BEFORE their parents die
The Bushes are a prime example - dad is still alive but the brothers have managed to get money simply because dad is rich

Trump talked about making a $650,000 real estate purchase when he was at school - he did not need to inherit the money - dad was still alive - just borrow it and pocket the profit

Republicans Love Giving Away Free Stuff — But Only to People Who Already Have Lots of Stuff

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
You can't really expect much of the kind of party that puts a job killing, tax avoiding, sociopath like Romney at the top of its ticket. Hell, that kind of party would flirt with a billionaire businessman whose only connection heretofore with government has been on the giving side of graft.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Unless you have an unconditional basic income and not working was a viable alternative, the employees don't have a choice - they have to work or they will be homeless. It's called ""wage slavery"" - with the decline of unions, stagnating minimum wage, as well as labor surplus due to outsourcing and productivity gains, the corporations have all the bargaining power and use it to exploit the working class.

Somehow or other you NEVER address the issue of responsible gun owners stepping up to propose better ways to handle the problems of wild eyed loonies shooting up neighborhoods or schools etc. All you can say is FREEDOM, which of course, isn't the issue. In other words, you are incapable of answering and a waste of my time.

Ted Cruz Explains Which Religions Are OK for American Presidents

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
It's not like we don't have a living President who said pretty nasty things about Atheists.


It bugs me, certainly, but I already knew he was an asshole.  He'd use the same statement against other Christians, as well, saying they're insufficiently pious.  He'd use it against Obama, who is in no way an Atheist.  He'd use it against Trump.  He'd use it against Jeb! Bush.

# News comment title:
Congress Has Agreed On a Highway Bill!

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
We love to create silly budgeting rules that only cause problems, not solve them. The debt ceiling is a tangential example, but with the same effect - at best it does nothing, at worst it causes our economy to collapse. Social Security is a closer example; simply eliminating the trust fund and paying for it out of the general fund would have absolutely no effect on the deficit or taxes, but would end all of the doom and gloom about what happens when we ""run out of money"" (there has never been actual money in the trust fund, just non-marketable securities).

It seems kind of silly to sell off oil reserves when oil is at  such an extremely low price?

Gas is a proxy. My point is that the cost of repairing the roads should be spread out to the major beneficiaries of road use that incidentally cause the most damage.  I wasn't really arguing for or against environmental costs. So, putting aside pollution, gas is an imperfect proxy for road damage. I doubt that trucks pay enough gas tax to cover the damage they do to roads (but yes, there are other truck fees, I am trying to point out that increasing the gas tax hits the wrong road users most severely). AND if gas is a proxy, what about electric vehicles?

Some Startups Actually Do Make the World a Better Place

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I also think that social change may be hindered by the concept that passive investors (money lenders in effect)are entitled to a profit. That of course would require a completely different way of thinking. First the workers get a decent wage, the equipment gets maintained,and then the investors get a return.

Read Evonomics, Demos, Gar Alperovitz, and other sites. Bend your mind. Be like a scientist and test your paradigms. Review the actual mechanics of your thinking. Wonder why is it this way. Don't believe that the awy things are is really the natural order, because it has changed over the centuries...and it will again. And it has changed in many countries in recent history. You may not think it is ""new"" but you can't say this unless you do your research.

And now, because listening to someone repeat the current paradigm as if it was religious truth is really exhausting....

Want Lower Health Care Costs? Encourage Competition.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Competition in a private market doesn't work for health care, period. Actual consumers have little knowledge and little say - prices are determined by agreement among giant insurance companies or Medicare on one side and large (and growing) hospital corporations on the other. Non-profit hospitals seem to be on the way out, for whatever reasons.  Doctors generally charge what the traffic will bear and again consumers have no meaningful opportunity to buy on price.

Efforts should be directed towards replacing the system, not trying to impose anti-trust restrictions.

I suppose many people love in areas with 4 or more providers....but a relatively large number of people don't.  You can't have hospital competition in a market that won't support even one hospital.  So in effect the conclusion is: ""sucks to be you unless you live in an urbanized area""

# News comment title:
Here's What Actually Happened in the Great Sanders-Clinton Data Theft

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The one thing I don't get is that the Sanders staffers knew they were being tracked. Why would they try to exploit the system if they knew they were being tracked?

Regardless, firing the staffers involved was completely necessary, and I think submitting to independent audit is good. People need to realize that Bernie Sanders, the man, was no way involved in this. I have seen plenty of Clinton supporters saying ""Bernie you're unethical!"" or ""Bernie stole our data!""

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I find their anti-Clinton rhetoric to be off putting. And I like Sanders, some of followers I have a problem with.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Why? Doesn't every campaign do this sort of thing?  I keep wondering why, whenever Sanders followers do something, they are held to higher standards than anyone else.  They are normal humans like everyone else, maybe a tad more idealistic but still human.

<i>Do you characterize our undocumented guests that use the ER without insurance as freeloaders,</i>



If you like. Sure. 


But what of it? Unlike in Conservatopia, in the real world most people aren't barbaric enough to allow fellow human beings to die from untreated medical crises.


So, people are going to be treated here in the real world regardless of their ability to pay. We rather obviously can't force undocumented immigrants to buy health coverage (at least as long as Republican xenophobes block immigration reform). 


But we can force legal residents to do so. 


So deal with it.

They pay taxes  which support the use of ERs, so they aren't freeloaders.

When Men and Women Work Together, Men Get All the Credit

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Interesting difference in field. It would be nice to see a follow up piece in other fields. I have published 50+ engineering papers (maybe 2 have had female authors) and I was the only author on one. It usually the first author who matters most.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I don't know the customs for different fields, but yeah, you want your name to be the name in ""NAME et al"" if possible.  I assume this is because there's a clear lead researcher.  It obviously wouldn't be fair if the only name that ever got shown is the alphabetically first one.

But even outside academia this has an impact. I would argue it's an even bigger impact, because it's on the general public, not a narrow field of interested researchers.  As Kevin notes, authors are typically listed alphabetically in economics.  Yet Deaton is regularly mentioned first in this discussion.

Eg this Forbes article: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/11/07/angus-deatons-paper-on-working-class-white-males-killing-themselves-might-not-be-right/

Headline: Angus Deaton's Paper On Working Class White Males Killing Themselves Might Not Be Right

2nd Sentence: The basic point that Deaton and his partner (in both senses, his wife and also co-researcher on this paper) Anne Case



FFS, could that be any more demeaning?  Her name is completely left out to start, and then her relationship to him is given a higher priority than the fact she was a ""co-researcher"".  As if he felt sorry for his feeble, weak-minded wife so he let her tag along.

We aren't discussing sending people in to war, which he populace seems to support regardless of the charisma quotient of the politicians advocating combat.  
The act of one on one murder is somewhat different in most people's eyes.

I find it bizarre that he is bragging about ""self-funding"" which merely means that he can run without the support of anyone else since he has so much money. And he proved that he didn't have enough support in Iowa, so unless he voted for himself many many times, the self-funding didn't persuade enough voters to back him. Hell, I could be self-funding if I liked to promote myself too

Female Genital Mutilation Is Not a Uniquely Muslim Problem

As somebody who grew up in Africa, I can assure you that the practice of female genital mutilation is older than Islam.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
You must be reading the teachings of a ""Muslim"" cleric. This is like saying that it is sanctioned by Christianity because a pastor sanctions it. In other words, It is not ""sanctioned by Islam"" anymore than it is ""sanctioned by Christianity"".  A little research would show your statement is wrong.

Heh.  I would vote for single payer or some Swiss style insurance over ACA and employer provided healthcare. Employer provided healthcare is a trap for employees.

# News comment title:
President Obama Shows How to Defend Pragmatism the Right Way

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
That was part of the tragedy of Obama. He was skilled enough to make compromise sound heroic, but he ascended to the Presidency in a post-bipartisan era. Mitch McConnell figured out that bipartisanship disproportionately benefited the party in power. So he would have none of it. 

Ironically, bipartisanship might be less threatening when Hillary takes over, since she would be incapable of taking credit for it. Not clear that would make a difference though: Republicans will still fear primaries more than they fear November.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
People have negative opinions about Hillary because they've been fed negative opinions about Hillary for 20+ years.  The people who actually know her and have worked with her seem to have a pretty high opinion of her.  There is a loop in effect where people end up blaming her for their own negative opinions about her.  For example, she's accused of being ""dishonest,"" she defends herself ( I thought pretty well), and the defense itself is a sign that she's dishonest, otherwise, why not just admit to being dishonest?  

What we have now is a situation where some people (like Drum here) simply assume she is ""flawed,"" and see everything through that prism.  Obama is alleged to have been able to talk about politics in a way she can't -- but what did it get him?  Has he broken any logjams, changed any minds, made the Republicans any saner?  If anything, they are batshit crazier now than when he got into office, although perhaps they have fallen a little -- a very little -- below the peak crazy of 2009 - 2012.  But that's probably as much to do with demographics and economic factors as anything else -- I see no evidence that Obama's allegedly silver tongue had anything to do with it.  

If Hillary had Obama's record, Drum and others would be blaming her for the current state of affairs because of her ""inability to communicate"" or some such, because they start out with the assumption that something's wrong with her, and reason backwards (quite literally) from there.  Obama's lack of progress, by comparison, is seen as just a part of the landscape, something immutable and unremarkable.  It certainly has nothing to do with HIM.

You want ME to research that for you?  Seriously? If all you want to do is say stuff, you can say stuff. If you want to see his record, you can google that. The Daily Kos has a list of some of his work.  Try, for instance, the VA reform bill. Or perhaps the provisions in the ACA he sponsored? What do YOU consider ""accomplishments""?

No, Bush projected productivity growth based on tax cuts, something we have never seen. Friedman bases it on injections of investment, something we have seen.You might argue that tax cuts=investment injection, but in reality what always happens is tax cuts=more money in Swiss banks,

I don't think we need a suite of statistical studies to figure out why we don't have masses of young people out buying homes. Unbelievable. It's almost as if no one realizes how shitty the economy is for people who don't have the free time to populate political blogs.

The Disturbing Reason Why Charter Schools May Have Higher Test Scores

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Personal responsibility even at a young age is not a bad thing. No responsibility, which has been the norm, is the recipe for failure as we have  seen for the last 20 years.  Why should children who want to learn be punished with a sub standard education because of those who aren't there to learn regardless of the reason 

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
No, you don't-  I also support it, and I have no say so whatsoever in how it is run.

How do you not understand this point?  PUBLIC money is being redirected to PRIVATE schools, some of whom are obviously little more than Christian madrases.

maybe not so surprising. both Trump and Clinton lead in voter enthusiasm, by quite a lot:

it's also possible that blog comments give us a misleading sense of where enthusiasm lies. 

for many non-blog commenters, the idea of the first woman president is still pretty damn exciting.

# News comment title:
Helping the Poor Is the Right Thing to Do, But Maybe Not Much of a Political Winner

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
In my opinion workers always get a boost from a decent wage increase. Maybe it will take some time for this guy to feel better. It's a good thing which should help democrats especially on the local level.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Silly Dumb-o-crats, doing something that is good for people without getting a big political benefit out of it.  Republicans would NEVER make such a dumb mistake.  In fact, Republicans usually try for the political boost WITHOUT the benefit to ordinary people -- that's an even better deal!

Well, if you're down and out, sometimes a raise is something that actually deprives you of something---food stamps, subsidized housing, etc. 

Plus, since when does Kevin the analytical use an anecdote as data?

# News comment title:
Bernie Voters Not Very Interested in Non-Bernie Democrats

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
""Bernie is basing a lot of his campaign not just on anti-Hillary sentiment, but on anti-Democratic-Party-establishment sentiment. That's fair enough, but like it or not, the Democratic Party is all we have to compete with Republicans.""

And by that logic, the Democratic Party cannot be changed.  Kloppenberg should have won, and it's a shame she didn't.  But why don't you shake your head at Kloppenberg's inability to connect with a sizable and dynamic portion of the modern Democratic electorate?  Blaming Sanders for bringing in voters that other Democrats are not seems counterproductive.

It's Been Quiet Lately. Maybe a Little Too Quiet...

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I'm pretty sure he's the GOP candidate who currently has 743 delegates compared to the second-place guy who only has 517.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I'm disappointed in the Secret Service. GOP delegates should be allowed to honor the second amendment in a manner of their patriotic choosing. Especially so considering the likelihood of a brokered convention and ensuing riot of middle-aged white people. Without guns they can't do much damage. With guns they can self-solve a big chunk of America's leading problem. All the Secret Service has to do is chain the doors shut and walk away.

The Wall Street Journal Cons Its Readers Yet Again

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Why do people watch Fox?  Why do blogging communities self-segregate?  Why do people attend religious institutions that ""comfort the comfortable""?  Because it validates their worldview.  It makes them feel better about themselves, and if they have twinges of conscience, it helps to soothe them.
 
Also, the news staff historically has been distinct from the editorial staff and has had a good reputation.  A lot of people bought the paper for the news and ignored the ranting in the back. Whether that has changed since the Murdoch takeover, I don't know.

Suggesting dirty tricks against the republicans?  Nasty and not necessary, given what they're doing to themselves any attempt to be as nasty as they are would fail.

Nope, just carry on carrying on.  They'll have so many holes in their feet by the end of the summer that we'll finally know how many holes it takes to fill Albert's Hall.

# News comment title:
Top Gun Lobbyist Calls Hundreds of Child Gun Deaths ""Occasional Mishaps""

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Commonsense background checks would help, so would requiring liability insurance.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I have to carry insurance on my car so that if I hurt you, m insurance pays and then they raise my rates or drop me.  Guns are a deadly weapon and it cost thousands of dollars in added taxes and health care costs to each taxpayer for all of the gun accidents, injuries, and deaths.....court costs, years of rehabilitation for injuries and welfare payments to the victims when they can't work.

Gun owners should pay for the costs to have guns. Most often they are the type of people who whine at paying taxes to fed a poor child and call that theft, but I don't want guns and I don't want to pay for gun accidents. Let the people who have them and profit from them, pay for the costs.

Let Us Now Psychoanalyze Young Ben Rhodes

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
One guesses that the anti-Rhodes media vituperation is coming from the 20-something digital reporters whose ignorance he just exposed.  I agree with Kevin that Rhodes was mainly bemoaning the state of the media landscape.  You can be sure that, with a Trump Presidency, foreign-policy coverage will be the blind leading the blind.

Bernie Sanders Has Been the Most Influential Insurgent Candidate Since the 70s

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Awfully generous of you, Kevin Drum!

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
For all practical purposes, this is entirely academic—Clinton's ""policies"" are limited to what she can legally accomplish by appointing justices and issuing executive orders. Unless the Democrats take back the House, which is spectacularly unlikely even with the Trumpening.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


A campaign is supposed to be aspirational, not about incrementalism. To say ""Yabbut, honestly, you know I can't do this, and I won't try because i will be defeated because the House is full of RWNJ"" isn't going to inspire the electorate.  It could inspire them once she is elected, by pointing out vigorously how obstructive the RWNJs are, something that Obama obfuscated in his attempts to ""reach across the aisle""

If you don't want Trump to win, vote for Bernie.

If Trump or Hillary win, the oligarchs win, and the people lose.  

Hillary is as bad or worse than Trump, she will get more bad things done.

Bill Clinton was chairman of the  DLC/New Democrats and converted the dems into Reaganomics loving corporate sellouts who are for: privatization, deregulation, cutting services for the poor, and being “business friendly” .

• <b>In spite</b> of the GOP leadership meetings on Inauguration Night where they pledged to block <i>everything</i> President Obama proposed (reported in multiple articles, FGS), 

• <b>despite</b> over 7 years of GOP Congress critters' public declarations reaffirming this pledge, 

• <b>in spite</b> of 7 years of behavioral evidence that the GOP was committed to and following through on their plan to block any and all presidential initiatives <i>regardless of the consequences for the nation or for the citizenry</i> - 

The MSM is still willing to put the blame for Republican Congressional obstruction solely on President Obama.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Kevin's last point is spot on --- reatime voice communication is already mostly a thing of the past. Both my teenagers have their phones, they probably talk on them around six times a year -- when their parents call to see where they are. Operation of the devices usually takes place a few feet away from the head. Heel. my kids don't even know how to have a proper conversation on the phone.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Mother Jones has some very positive aspects (not the least being this blog).  However, occasional egregious problems with reporting science strongly reduces my incentive to be supportive of the enterprise as a whole. This one is =so= obviously a wrong step, it points toward a conclusion that it was done primarily as clickbait.

Three Little Questions

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
<blockquote>But have any of you ever experienced... hundreds of tweets overwhelming your Twitter feed to tell you how great you are and how your latest piece was a work of genius?</blockquote>
The lurkers <I>always</I> support me in email...

To be serious, no, not on Twitter.  A couple of times I did get bulk positive response* in forums for my scribblings, but those days were pre-Twitter and those communities were more tightly-knit.

 -- Steve

* Said bulk responses were more in the multiple-dozens than hundreds; again, issues of scale crop up.

Why would Trump do this?  Let me count the whys:

1. Can't let go of a fight.

2. No impulse control.

3. The plagiarism bit is small potatoes, compared to two nights (so far) of anger and hate and demands to imprison Hillary.  The press is chasing the penny, and ignoring the silver dollar.  Trump steps up and keeps the penny rolling.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I'm curious if the media will push this story. It's something that could seriously damage him, and if it was Clinton I would think this would be issue #1 for weeks to come, but the major media outlets, so far, have shown to not be interested in anything other than the crazy things Trump says and how remarkable it is that he received the nomination.

Wall Street Billionaires To Advise Trump On Populist Economics

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Not at all, Kevin. He'll listen to them. Their key advice will be to 1) reduce the marginal tax rate for all income above $200K to 10% and 2) eliminate corporate taxes.

You don't need no steenkin' economist to tell you that these two actions alone will Make America Great Again and create millions and millions of the best jobs. And once the Wall is built, these jobs will go to Americans.

Any conflict-of-interest in these recommendations is purely coincidental.

# News comment title:
How a DNC Staffer's Murder Unleashed a Pefect Storm of Right-Wing Conspiracy Theories

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
So if I know, over my lifetime, of say, 15 people who have been murdered or died in some violent way, such as suicide, car accident, etc, does that mean I am in on the plot to kill them? (and I do know of at least that many)

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
""You don't hear of a Bush body count........""

That number would be 9,731, counting the 2,996 who perished on 9/11 after the Bush administration ignored the CIA's warnings of an imminent Al Qaeda attack on American soil, the 2,238 who've died in the resulting Afghan war to date and 4,497 who died needlessly in Darth Dick's Haliburton Jihad. 

And that doesn't account for the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan civilians who died, the millions who were injured/left homeless or the tens of thousands of Americans who've come home from the wars physically maimed and psycho-emotionally wounded.

Smarter about his limits than my house fly-catching 6 pounder.  She didn't worry about where the ground was until she was five feet up and chewing the fly on the way back down.  Truly a felinecannonball.  Our other was more Hilbertesqe.  Besides a few short lunges, he had us trained to bring the feathers within reach of his lounging position.  

Happy mid-August everyone.  I'm going to go get lost in the Sierras for a bit starting early next week.

Is Contraception Really Key?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Now take a look at the stats in regressive states, such as Texas....

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Their measurement of 'sexual activity' is very lossy.  Someone who has sex regularly and someone who has it once a year are both 'sexually active'.  Another denominator problem.

Also, methods of contraception vary - some are better than others.  By alot.  Access to more than one type of contraception would be counted the same, but in reality, work much better.

And between 2009 and 2012, more have access to consistent use of the pill.  And IUDs, forgot those.

it literally happens 8 hours a day, every weekday, for me.

i listen to music on my phone at work and i keep the phone plugged into my computer for charging and in case i need to copy stuff off of it (pix usually). it is the primary way i use my iPhone.

You want to know when you want to listen to your earbuds while your phone is charging?  I'll tell you when.  When you've got to travel four hundred freaking miles for the holidays twice a year with multiple effing cats in their carriers in the back because your mom demands to see the grandkitties every year and it's not like you really have the heart to board them anymore anyway.  That's when!  And hell no.

Donald Trump's Love Affair With Vladimir Putin Really Is Alarming

one more reason i can hate greenwald.  he's done some important journalism, but stuff like this just stupid.  the difference between trying to improve diplomatic relations and obsequious fawning over a dangerous autocrat with whom you have at least indirect financial ties is so obvious it's unfathomable greenwald doesn't really understand it.

# News comment title:
Where Did Trump's VAT Nonsense Come From Last Night?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
We could have our own VAT any time we wanted one. That's a matter of internal tax policy, not trade policy. VAT is, very roughly, a more complicated kind of sales tax. Some wag once predicted that we would get one when conservatives figured out that it was regressive and liberals figured out that it was a money machine. Actually, I think the opposite happened: we don't have it because conservatives have figured out that it's a money machine and liberals have figured out it's regressive.

# News comment title:
Weekend Catch-Up: How Did Donald Trump Lose $916 Million?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Since (at a guess) the loss is inflated and fraudulent, and the entity that it was parked in fraudulent as well, I can only wonder if Trump will ever have to answer for defrauding Uncle Sam. You can get away with defrauding small fry like the Trump U marks and any vendor unfortunate enough to do business with him, but Uncle Sam doesn't take kindly to it. Maybe this whole campaign has been a Hail Mary pass trying to get in office soon enough to shut down IRS probes into his finances.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Given how huge this loss is, maybe the Clinton team ought to start calling him ""The Biggest Loser""

""In today's Republican Party 'in spite of' is not the phrase we need. Ignorance and lack of education are positive qualifications, bordering on obligatory.

Surely not unrelated to middle class stagnation, and the need for two incomes to maintain middle class standards, and the resulting strains on parents' time and energy.

Weekly Poll Update: Donald Trump Is Imploding

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
A chance?  Sure.  And when I buy a Lotto ticket, I have a chance of winning.   Even the Senate is barely 50-50, and that includes people like Manchin.  Let's not get into <i>another</i> cycle of unrealistic expectations followed by disappointment and recrimination.

Jesus, a Hillary Clinton presidency with a 50-50 Senate?  The government is going to be funded thirty minutes at a time.

The New York Times Cuts Through the Hype on GMOs

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Total bullshit. Lost a lot of respect for Mother Jones with this. Did you bother to look into how much GMO feedstock Europe imports from us when you claim Europe hasn't lost anything by not growing as much GMO as us?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Are you even going to mention that the charts are misleading? They use the wrong units (between France and USA) and the article fails to mention that the US uses less herbicide per unit area than France. Don't you find the comparison to France only as arbitrary? Does the out of place fearmongering about agent orange and sarin not throw up a red flag? Do you understand that assessing pesticides by weight only and ignoring their relative toxicities make the figures irrelevant to a discussion of human health in the first place? If these questions didn't pop into your head while you were reading the piece you frankly lack the technical qualifications to understand, distil/share, and comment on this field.

""The article has predictably generated a storm of criticism from industry enthusiasts."" More like the scientific community. Do you care about reporting accurate information and having an honest discussion? or just about 'winning' for your ideology. We (the Left) often claim intellectual superiority over know-nothing Republicans for their climate change denialism, voodoo economics, intelligent design and etc. It's ideological writers like you that balance the scales of know-nothingness and pollute the public discourse. It gives academic scientists (like me) who'd like to rational debate about a common set of facts sleepless nights. 

""... it's refreshing to see the topic covered with such precision and clarity in the paper of record."" - Get it to together or get out of the science journalism game.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


The biggest issue with GMOs isn't whether they perform as promised, nor even the potential harm to humans, but whether they encourage monocultures and increase the fragility of our food supplies and ecosystems.

Obama was an assassin for the Phoenix program under Richard Komer in Saigon. He time travelled to Kenya as a part of the reverse Manchurian candidate SAP after he altered the records so people would believe the entire republican leadership were draft dodgers. It's simple if  You know the TRUTH. Hillary wears the Phoenix to access his satanic power, it's activated by the spirit cooking. Jeez, don't you people keep up with science?

# News comment title:
Republicans and the Popular Vote

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
All the more reason to pass a Constitutional amendment making the presidency decided by a popular vote. There is no logical reason why some votes should count more than others when electing a person who is supposed to represent the country as a whole.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Another anti-democratic (small d) feature of American politics. Every state gets at least three electoral votes, so a voter in Wyoming has way more influence than a voter in California. Those rural states sure are oppressed.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Or each state could mandate that the electors vote for the candidate that wins the majority of the votes.

Let's Please Kill Off the ""White Supremacy"" Fad

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
This post highlights one of Kevin's consistent errors: use of the word ""bad"". It's one of Trump's favorites. Here, the postscript suggests he means ""bad"" as in ""bad strategy"". But if I wanted cult of savvy I'd read Chris Godzilla.

The reason Kevin is confused is that what Ta-Nehisis Coates and others are doing is revealing the moral ""bad"" that permeates the discourse of good hearted white men like Bernie Sanders and Kevin Drum. 

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Thank you for responding. Open, honest discussion is exactly what we need.

Here's the rub: You, and others found his reply 'dismissive' while my understanding was that he was focusing on what we, as citizens regardless of background, should be focusing on.

As an 'old white guy' (and I certainly don't speak for that demographic), what happens when POC make it about race, the attention goes from children, climate change, women's rights, etc to race.
I'm past that (sees skewers at the ready).

If we truly want a color blind country, with freedom for all then we must focus on issues that affect all of us.

That unified, issue-focused platform benefits us all, including POC.

# News comment title:
Chart of the Day: Is Democracy Falling Apart?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Queen Ivanka will rule with mercy.  One hopes, at least

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
So, I went to the <a href=""http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp"">World Values Survey database</a> where this seems to actually be coming from [1], and I have to note that the result is a bit overstated.

The actual question was to rate the importance of democracy on a scale of 1-10, and 29.2% of people below age 30 rated it a 10 (= absolutely important), which is what the chart seems to display. Another 13.3% rated it a 9 and 13.2% rated it an 8. While this still isn't exactly happiness-inducing, it's a bit less depressing.

[1] I.e. this is the source cited in the paper that the NY Times references.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
<i>Earlier this morning, <b>for no particular reason</b>, Trump decided that we should cancel the contract for a new pair of Air Force Ones.</i>



The Trump tweet did not happen ""for no particular reason.""  Trump was responding to a Chicago Tribune article that noted Boeing's concern about Trump's trade policies.  The Tribune article was published 22 minutes earlier.


The details about the Boeing contract might be nonsense.  But the lesson here is how Trump responds to his critics.  That's important and should not be ignored.

Well, since they just won the last election (as well as dominating state houses and governorships in most of the country), rural people ARE the ones in power right now.  So if your logic holds true, it is they that now should stop sneering at us.  Funny though... sneers from the political right to the political left are never as widely or strongly condemned as those from the political left to the political right... wonder why that is? #iokiyar

John Bolton Set To Be #2 At State Department

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
God has given up on us.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
To understand Bolton you just have to remember he is a suck up/kick down manager. He will go out of his way to criticize, disparage, and just generally dump on those under him, while doing everything possible to suck up to those above him. His suggestion on FOX news that the hacking of Democratic emails is a false flag operation is ludicrous on its face to almost everyone, but it is music to Donald's ears. Bolton may be a suck up, but that's exactly who Donald likes having under him.

Climate Scientists Are Copying All Their Data to Protect It From Trump

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
<i>I doubt this will happen. I'm not even sure how it could happen.</i>
 
Really?  After the Bush administration deleted <i>22 million</i> emails -- official government records, which are protected by law -- including <i>all</i> emails from Dick Cheney's office for <i>several months</i> surrounding the decision to go to war in Iraq?  From a candidate who still denies he lost the popular vote and claims he won the electoral vote by a historical landslide?  From a party in which nearly <i>half</i> of the people claim not to ""believe in"" <i>evolution?!</i> 
 
Republicans will happily deny reality and flout the law whenever they see a possible advantage in doing so, and they have demonstrated repeatedly that they don't care about climate change or even about science in general.  
 
Why <i>wouldn't</i> they do this?  Those data are inconvenient -- they interfere with the narrative and might reduce profits.  I wouldn't be surprised if they already have someone figuring out how to make it happen.

No fictionless, weakening institutions, and rotting culture in the flyover states. The message the world gets isn't there was one fuckup or con. The message is, the US is sickly enough this is possible now. That's way worse.

Apparently McConnell threatened to do an all out war on Democrats if Obama so much as breathed a word without total absolute proof. A nd now McConnell is backed up against a brick wall and has to pretend he cares.  Republicans are all abou tbeing in power, they don't' care how they get there.

Clearly, Trump realized that the people whose votes he needed weren't going to be a very scholarly bunch. So of course he resorted to the language and imagery of fear, loathing, racism, misogynty and bigotry to get them all riled up, writing checks and running to the polls to ""make America great again"" by putting the brakes on the country's ""evolution"" towards more freedom for individuals, more responsibility for corporations and more protections for the environment, (etc), in the name of ""religious freedom"", ""saving jobs"" and protecting America from ""the other"". 

It isn't like we couldn't see that it was happening. It was right in front of our eyes for a year and a half, and we'd been witnessing the republicans and their media minions whipping their base into a frenzy for 8 years against the Obama presidency with verbiage that was classic, early 50's McCarthy. Yet the intensity of the backlash that resulted was still shocking, at least to me, one of the many who never believed a troll like Trump could be elected. Who knew that for so many tens of millions of Americans the 50's never ended?

We are pretty sure this is true because his Daddy and Grandaddy were either KKK or KKK symps. And his leasing policies have regularly been the subject of anti-discrimination lawsuits. If the press had reported on these things instead of Clinton's not-illegal email issues, perhaps fewer people of color would have voted fro Trump in the misguided feeling that he might create more jobs

You need to do a little fact checking before you open your mouth or type your screed. Health care has gone up, yes, but it was going up DRAMATICALLY before the ACA and has gone up AT A MUCH SLOWER PACE since the ACA.


And I can't help it if you are willfully ignorant, since you are playing the game the health insurers and the Republicans want you to play, taking all their little twisty lies and quasi-facts and trying to turn reality on its head. 



Actually the best thing to have, to cut way back on heath care costs, is single payer or nationalized health care.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Every fuckwit who comes here with a shit eating grin yelping about ""professor plum"" or any other conspiracy mongering disparagement - dredged from the ass of the alt-right - of the facts needs to answer how having confidential email on private email server differs from having the exact same emails on a .gov server.

Remember, shitheads, dirtbags, and pig fuckers, the moment you start whining about FOIA you have left the realm of the FBI's investigation into ""national security"" - so don't even bother with that verbal diarrhea.

If you start quoting anything about removing secure information from a protected location then you clearly don't understand the fucking question - since the .gov address isn't fucking protected and is not allowed to have any of the god damned information you are bitching about.

If you want to call this all conspiracy mongering, you loathsome moral lepers, you need to show that there was a non-zero chance that Clinton's emails were a legitimate question for the FBI.

Women Kill Fewer Medicare Patients Than Men

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
This doesn't surprise me in the least. I've noticed for a long time that men are a lot less careful than women in almost everything - they drive more recklessly, they wash dishes with far less care, they toss things around without heed, they do things without really paying attention to what they're doing a lot more often. That they are also more careless when treating patients fits right into the pattern. I'm not sure whether it's nature or nurture, but it's definitely real.

Ok, here's the Trumpkin agenda:
1.  Deny the situation.  It's just a blip.  The numbers are cooked.  Ignore personal economic consequences.
2.  Blame someone who had nothing to do with it.  Obama.  Barney Frank.  Jimmy Carter.
3.  Expand (2) to entire populations of scapegoats.  It's the Mexicans stealing all our jobs.  It's the welfare queens.
4.  Double down on (3).  Pass laws that target minorities.  Have police and other agencies intimidate them.  Open internal detention centers.
5.  Start a war.  That'll distract everybody.

Upside down flags vs. suppressing the right to protest peacefully. (And it would have been peaceful had the cops stayed away)
""Out-of-town agitators"" vs. out of town cops all done up like Seal Team Six.

The more the sheriff tries to make a case for the abuses that took place the more absurd he and his troops look and sound.
I'm sure the president-defect will give them all commendations on his first day in the oval orifice.

What special little snowflakes those SOs are, all bothered by an upside down flag, and snowballs made specially to wound the outstanding well bundled officers just sitting out there all innocent like and tender and caring

My guess is downloads are really priced per song. Most people just buy a few songs and not the whole album, so this is cheaper than CD.

The idea that someone like Donald Trump would ever be considered a suitable appointee to public office is completely outlandish.

I think slow-boiled frog syndrome has overtaken many Americans. For all the welter of mockery of Trump in US commentary, I don't get the feeling people understand what a complete farce his victory was and how ruinous it will be for their country's governance. Lots of people still seem to be in denial, pretending even now that somehow or other it will all be all right once he's in the White House.

It won't be.

You are surprised that thuggish capitalist oligarchs, a small group of people in terms of world population, all driven by boundless greed and narcissism, are conspiring to put themselves in control? Putin is more of a ruthless oligarch such as we had during the ""conquering"" of the West than he is a former KGB agent. Trump is our very own autarch wannabe, a trait in full display during the fake reality show, the Apprentice. The weirdness comes from the fact that these people live in their own self-referential world.  Power corrupts, and the insanity of addiction to power needs to be spelled out again and again; Trump and Putin are just two addicts. Too bad they are in power and we accept that.

Cops' Feelings on Race Show How Far We Have to Go

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The very last stat is the most telling. Which begs the question how many of those officers aggressively escalated the situation that led to the physical confrontation? Because as we all know from recent videos resisting arrest is a variable and discretionary charge and seemingly caused by officers escalating the situation beyond what is called for.

Shortly before I read this I read a series of 15 or so tweets about how conservatives got their base to not trust the media.  It was about things that actually have occurred, things that happen every day.  The reality deniers were out in force disputing facts.  Evidence that it's been a successful campaign is in the people disputing facts, when presented with facts will deny the facts. Nope, that's not a fact because x. False, because I know the media lies.  Their arguments have no basis in reality. They regurgitate the mantra they've been taught, ""MSM lies"", etc. It's about time that the headlines reflect this.

This is called cultism. There is a paranoid cult, similar to cults that expect flying saucers to take them off the top of a mountain, and when that doesn't happen insist that their beliefs are true, they simply misinterpreted the alien messages.  Conservatism today meets the criteria for a cult: belief in things that just plain aren't true such as supply side economics, rich people work hard to get wealthy (most of them inherit it), inheritance taxes are double taxation, them others getting welfare are causing high taxes, them others are variously lazy, stealing our jobs, etc...the beliefs are staggeringly wrong and the believers can't believe their lying eyes.

Does he want to send Feds to St Louis? To Detroit? After all, they have higher murder rate than Chicago. How about Salinas, CA?  Seriously, folks, if you want to go on a bender about murders, you need to figure out why 24 cities are ahead of Chicago on murder rates

The Quebec City Mosque Attacker Was a Right-Wing Troll for Trump

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
So yeah, a terrorist attacks a Church and Fox and the Trumpians blame Islam.

A terrorist attacks a Mosque and Fox and the Trumpians STILL blame Islam.

Right.

Does one think that maybe the Trumpians believe that all Terrorists are Muslims?

It's just like telling women that they are a special interest group, and they are doing 'identity' politics when they bring up something that affects them (as if it didn't affect everyone else too). 

This is the same kind of whining that racists do when someone dares to tell them they are racists.

# News comment title:
We Need to Agree On a Set of Rules For Calling Something a Lie

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I think it depends on the situation. In politics, when you make an affirmative statement that something happened, there is an assumption that it is supported by facts. If it is not supported by facts, a reckless disregard for the knowledge is the same as knowing.
 
I think if the politician is talking about a number of issues, and misstates an ancillary fact, that can be given some deference. 

But to take a recent example, talking about a 'Bowling Green massacre' without any knowledge of whether it's true or not, caiveln only be known as a lie, even if subjectly it was only a eckless disregard for the truth.

I think people can parse certain issues to the point of ridiculousness.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Yes, it is lie.  It is deliberate and premeditated and it has a specific objective: to devalue the concept of truth and public trust in anyone who may contradict Trump.

Trump is both a bullshitter and a liar.

And the poor Christian extremists are victimized and brutalized most of all! It's just like Pat Robertson said: ""Just like what Nazi Germany did to the Jews, so liberal America is now doing to the evangelical Christians. It's no different. It is happening all over again.""

""It is the Democratic Congress, the liberal-based media and the homosexuals who want to destroy the Christians.......Wholesale abuse and discrimination and the worst bigotry directed toward any group in America today. More terrible than anything suffered by any minority in history.""

# News comment title:
What? Republicans Were Serious About Killing Obamacare?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Another voter who didn't take Trumpy ""literally.""

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
So, what are we looking at, exactly?

A) ""I was really stoked about the blaming other people/punching brown and down stuff when I voted Trump, but since I'm not racist I'm just economically angsty, I figured as long as I am white my stuff wouldn't get touched.""

B) ""I spent the last eight years watching the GOP demagogue about health care and block any opportunities to fix health care, and blamed Democrats and Obama for not Green-lanterning their way out of it""

C) ""I barely pay attention to politics at all, but pop-culture portrayals of politicians as a cowardly, sniveling class of people who needlessly complicate things with bureaucracy (for fun, maybe?) or are on the take from Big Everything when there are clear, simple, win-win solutions that any straight talking hero could effortlessly implement inform everything I know about real-life politics. And that Trump fellow seemed like a business genius on that teevee show, so when he said it would be easy to do everything I believed him.""

# News comment title:
Trump Plans to Slash the Most Effective Social Program in History

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
For them, this would be win-win.  On the one hand, they'd get to slash the EPA's budget, saving (a little) money and publicly beating on ""job-killing regulators,""  And on the other, there might (eventually) be a surge in juvenile crime, which would make their Fox-saturated elderly shut-in and racist goober supporters even more malleable than they are today.  That it might wreck families and cities is utterly irrelevant -- those people don't vote Republican.
 
They are not interested in responsible government.  They think destruction of government and looting by their (wealthy) supporters are GOOD things.  They are propagandists and vandals.

The Republican Health Care Bill Is Carefully Crafted to Solve a Specific Problem

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The irony is that probably most of the Republican opposition in the House and among the rank and file is because this bill doesn't go far enough in destroying Obamacare.  Inadequate subsidies?  No, they insist that there be <u>no</u> subsidies whatsoever.  These people don't want it to even look like the Republicans are putting forward an alternative way of addressing health care, they want repeal and do not replace.

Also wouldn't a 50-year career at AT&T leave you with more of a pension than a 401(k)?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
And repealing Dodd-Frank and other Wall-Street regulations designed to stop repeats, is an odd response to being outraged by the 2008 crisis. Reminds me of an Atrios joke about people who went hard-core conservative after 9/11. “I used to consider myself a Democrat, but thanks to 9/11, I'm outraged by Chappaquiddick.""

Victim culture, If you expect that your stocks and clever investments will elevate you into upper middle class even though you have spent your whole life in the middle middle class, you might think the whole world is against you when, like me, you contemplate SocSec and realize you may have to work until you are a zillion years old. But you know what? Most people retired poor, and only my generation (baby boomers) expected to retire rich.

He's fucking full of shit anyway. He's claiming that we are taxing ""working mothers in Detroit"" to pay for these things.

That's a god damned, full-throated, mother fucking lie.

Three fucking billion dollars is ten dollars a year for every person in the United States. Less than a dollar in a fucking month. They are gutting this purely so the CAN shit on things like Meals on Wheels.

# News comment title:
Combining Obamacare and Trumpcare Might Save Health Insurance

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Any Democrat who doesn't raise hell against a bill that harms the poor and seniors over what we have now should be thrown out of the party by force.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Susan Collins.  Yeah, right.  She spent the summer of 2009 playing coy and hinting that she just might vote for the ACA if a few changes were made.  In the end, she voted with the rest of the GOP in opposing the ACA.  I recall an interview with Max Baucus in which he said that Susan Collins wasted their time.  I'm sure it was deliberate.

There are models out there: the German model and the Swiss model. These allow private insurance companies. BUT they limit the profits, they force real drug price negotiation, and they control salaries. Cost drivers in the US aren't totally based on sick-old/healthy-young risk sharing.  They are also based on profligate profits, horrendously outrageous salaries for do-nothing  executives in all the healthcare industries, and also (lo the poor doctors!) disproportionate salaries for specialized MDs (partly due to barriers to entry such as idiotic licensing requirements with non-recognition across borders of all sorts).

# News comment title:
Investors Are Crazy Optimistic, But For No Apparent Reason

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
<i>Roughly speaking, pink is how things are and purple is how people feel.</i>

Another way to say this is: purple is how investors think the market will behave, pink is how it behaved to date. In theory, the purple should lead the pink. This is not always the case.

IMO, that purple is going to come crashing down before the year is out, as investors begin to realize that Trump will not accomplish a whole lot for them in the near term. The pink will follow suit, and for those investors who have cash it will be a buying opportunity.

There was an attempt to negotiate Assad out of power in 2011-2012.  The Russians pretty much fubared it by insisting that Assad be allowed safe passage anywhere. Plus of course Assad decided he wasn't all that interested.  Why bother when Russia keeps you in weapons with all kinds of protection from the rebels?

# News comment title:
Republicans Love Bombing, But Only When a Republican Does It

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
<i>I wonder if this is a fairly consistent result? </i>

I think it is, and I'm sure there's some academic who has done such a study. My sense is that Republicans tend to fall in line pretty quickly behind the leader <i>du jour</i>, whereas Democrats tend to <strike>argue</strike> debate over everything.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
The obvious thing would be deficit spending.  If a Republican is president then deficits don't matter, if a Democrat is president then deficits are enslaving your grandchildren.

# News comment title:
French Election Will Be Between Macron and Le Pen

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Those numbers look familiar, from the '30's, maybe. Frightening. 

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
As the French ponder their political future, they should take to heart the words of Honest Abe Lincoln: ""At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant, to step the Ocean, and crush us at a blow? Never!""  {...}

""At what point, then, is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.""

(Of course ol' Abe never could have imagined the machinations of a sinister psychopath like Nasty-Vlad Putin stepping the oceans of cyberspace to strike at western democracies great and small). But here's hoping the French prove to be more intelligent and less ignorant than the Americans and British were when they went to the polls the last time. 

Hopefully Le Pen's trip to Moscow last month, her photo-op glad-handing with Putin himself and the revelation that her party received a $9,700,000 loan from a Russian bank a few years ago have awakened enough Frenchmen to the reality of their choices to insure her defeat..... http://www.salon.com/2017/03/24/marine-le-pen-meets-with-vladimir-putin-its-now-the-world-of-putin-the-world-of-donald-trump/

# News comment title:
Trump Tax Plan Unveiled!

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
You think a Republican-dominated Congress will object? That's practically their wish list, and everything the anti-tax crowd could hope for short of abolishing either the corporate income tax or the personal income tax. 

Democrats better filibuster this, and mock Trump for acting like introducing a crappy one-page bill counts as an ""accomplishment"".

The Comey Firing: Obstruction of Justice or Just Trump Being Trump?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Apparently due to the mortal fear of being branded the version of Breitbart on the other side of the aisle, even the supposedly progressive site like Mother Jones needs a smoking gun to state definitively and with firm conviction  that Trump has done something  criminal, when the fire is burning right in front of their noses and  Trump is holding the source of the fire.



Amazing. Just amazing.

complaints to my US rep's 'ruby red' district office. 
Took a long time to get through, and instead of

staff worker was belligerent. It got nasty from there.

Is Trump Looking For a New Press Secretary?

<i>""President Donald Trump is scheduled to depart Friday on an 11-day, five-country tour that comes at a moment of major turmoil in his administration – and, as usual, he’ll be joined by a large traveling band of his top aides, who often stick close to the president for fear of being out of the loop, or diminished in power, if they stray from his side.

Son-in-law Jared Kushner, daughter Ivanka Trump, chief strategist Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, economic adviser Gary Cohn, deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell, policy adviser Stephen Miller and press secretary Sean Spicer will all be along for major chunks of the trip, according to multiple White House officials. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will travel with Trump through the final stop in Sicily for the G7 conference, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster will be along for the entirety of the trip.

Also among those traveling with the president: his trusted aide Hope Hicks, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders and National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton, among others.""</i>

President Trump Won't Take the Cable Car Up to Masada

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I am not crazy about heights either, but I did the cable car up to Masada many years ago and it was no big deal.

Poor little tough guy.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Yesterday it was reported that he wants to cut his visit to the Holocaust Museum down to 15 minutes, just time enough to make some brief comments and then skedaddle. Past presidents have spent an hour touring the museum and giving lengthy speeches. He's not even there yet and he's already dissing people. The guy's ignorance is the irresistible force. 

From Think Progress:...""Here are some of the things Donald Trump is happy to do for longer than 15 minutes: Play golf at one of his own courses. Talk about the crowd sizes at his inauguration. Watch Fox & Friends every morning.""

""Here are some of the things he won’t do for longer than 15 minutes: Read intelligence briefings that don’t mention his name. Keep state secrets to himself. Or, apparently, pay respects to the victims of the Holocaust.""

""According to Israeli publication YNet News, Donald Trump’s advance team wants to shorten his visit to Israel’s Holocaust memorial to no more than 15 minutes, just enough time to sign the Yad Vashem guest book and deliver brief remarks....""

""In contrast, both Barack Obama and George W. Bush spent at least an hour at Yad Vashem, touring the museum and giving a public speech. The duration of his visit—shorter than his time spent schmoozing with the New England Patriots last month—might pass unobserved were it not for the Trump administration’s already tense relationship with the Jewish community and shaky grasp on the facts of the Holocaust."" ....  https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trumps-very-short-trip-to-yad-vashem-8f451da9090a

# News comment title:
What Do Millennials Spend All Their Money On?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
9 times of of 10 (if not 99 times out of 100), when people complain about ""millennials"" they're really talking about a very small demographic, not a very large and disparate generation. And even within their confirmation bias they get almost everything wrong.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
This article is in contrast to most of the other information on Millennials (many of them focusing only on home ownership) that suggest that this generation has less disposable income. I noticed that you are looking at income after expenditures which is smart, but did not include student loans, credit cards, etc. When we factor in this data where do we end up in your estimation? Why might other people arrive at different conclusions?

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Today most education is funded through student loans, with a small smattering of work study. You used to be able to get a Pell Grant rather easily, which covered a lot of costs, and then work study, and then a student loan to cover the balance. Now it is STUDENT LOANS, work study perhaps, and Pell Grants? what's that?  Believe me, I did undergraduate work in both eras, and the difference was stunning Both my offspring, as adults, never were offered any grants or work study, but they were fortunate and got scholarships.

The most repulsive donuts in the world, Voodoo Donuts, are boxed in pink in Denver...as well as stickily stacked in paint buckets as a cute note.

It's quite lovely. 

Of course, what I'm really waiting for is a genetically engineered blue rose. I know they've tried, but it still doesn't look very blue to me.

In Which I Waste a Lot of Time on Climate Change Yahooism

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
And yet, in the long run, Paul Ehrlich will be right. It is impossible to continue to grow population indefinitely. Those of us who were alive in the '60s now see a significantly degraded planet compared to the one we started with. Although some of the most egregious forms of pollution have slowed, habitat devastation has accelerated.  See https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/ for various essays demonstrating this.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
All this from the people who predict the end of civilization as we know it if we let gays marry or transsexuals use the bathroom of their choice. Who were convinced we would all die of Ebola virus. Who fear that they will be murdered in their beds if we ever move any detainees from Guantanamo to a domestic super max prison.

Over 50? Trumpcare Will Raise Your Premiums $4,500.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
To Republicans, anyone over 40 is expendible.  This bill will harm the children and elderly on Medicaid most of all.  Where will the Medicaid people living in nursing homes go?  Many of these people worked all their lives but have run through their savings (major illnesses could do that quickly).  What is the Republican solution?  Shoot them?  Let them starve or be murdered in the streets?

This is not a health care plan.  It is a death plan to subsidize tax cuts.

Jimmy Kimmel will be thrilled to hear that his newborn with the heart defect is no different that a wrecked Hyundai. Meanwhile, republicans want to force a woman to give birth to a fetus she knows has serious defects and wants to abort.....and then they'll cut the benefits she needs to care for her ""tiny little accident.""

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I mean, that's just dumb. If you really want national single-payer (which I do, BTW), setting up a poorly designed experiment at the state level, which is likely to struggle out the gates (at the very least), seems like the best way to give your enemies ammo against a push for single-payer at the national level.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
A strategy of purging your own ranks via purity crusades, then campaigning on promises with no consideration for the messy details of how they would work... gee, wonder where we've seen that before.

As Republicans have demonstrated, you can in fact seize power that way. But then you're faced with the question of what to do with power now you've got it. And as Republicans are currently demonstrating, that's a big problem when you've purged away everyone in your party who worries about details and implementation and consequences.

Reminder: Trump and the Republicans promised better care for less money, now they're delivering less care for more money and giving the profits to the rich. They do this because they're fucking liars who know the people who vote for them are gullible imbeciles.

This has been a public service announcement.

Meanwhile The Denver Post has an article whining about how the booming local construction industry can't find workers, while stating that wages are pretty good for the area (but in fact, adjusted for inflation, they are lower than 10 years ago!...and the cost of living in Denver has skyrocketed well beyond the nominal inflation rate).  Then the article splutters about how workers walked off the job after being denied a 50 cent an hour increase.

Oh, hell. If you read the commentary, they don't even argue his facts, they just trot out alternate ""facts"" (Global Warming Pause, variations in the Milankovitch cycles, past climate change, blah blah blah).

# News comment title:
Latest Campus Outrage: Instructor Tells Baldly Racist Joke, Loses Job

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
What is the problem?

Given that the cons abhor colleges, and higher education in general, they should be happy that the liberal sensitivities are killing off the object of their hate one instructor at a time. What more can they want?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I would say the correct response is to haul him in front of a disciplinary committee, insist that he apologize personally to the class, determine whether this is part of a pattern of behavior, and THEN decide whether to fire him.  And they may well have done that, and he might have refused to apologize, or they might have determined that this is a pattern and decided to fire him for that reason, which would IMO be entirely appropriate.

An instructor is an authority figure, Hopkins is an educational institution (a private one BTW), and that kind of public display of bigotry is IMO completely inappropriate in that situation.

I would add that, had he been in any of the major corporations where I have worked, he might well have been fired immediately.

There certainly are instances of hypersensitivity among students and among the organized left, to which I agree: chill out.  But this is something that even a first-year instructor should know full well is over the line.

The Rich Sure Do Cheat On Their Taxes a Lot

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
It's not at all surprising. It's hard to cheat as a regular wage earner, most likely it isn't profitable to hire an army of tax lawyers to shield you from any liability, and the penalties are sufficiently harsh  to discourage it. The more you make, the more profitable it is to evade taxes and the less likely it is that there will be any penalty.

Meanwhile......""Working with Republicans in Congress has proved fruitless for Trump’s agenda. In the wake of multiple failures, it seems the White House is turning to Democrats for help.....a few dozen are quietly being recruited to address tax reform. The president is so desperate to have a “win” that the White House wants to avoid what happened with Obamacare at all costs."" .... http://www.rawstory.com/2017/08/desperate-trump-comes-begging-to-democrats-to-help-him-notch-a-win-on-tax-reform/

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
The Tax Foundation, while accurately assembling all the pieces, ignores the elephant in the room: that the extremely high tax rates of the post-war era served effectively as a salary cap upon the wealthiest. The result was a restraint upon wealth accumulation which necessarily contributed to far less income inequality than we have today. The Slate article mentions this:

<i>One popular theory among left-leaning intellectuals right now—advanced by Piketty, Saez, and their protege Stephanie Stantcheva—is that high tax rates actually ease income inequality by discouraging CEOs and professionals from demanding exorbitantly high pay for their services. In other words, thanks to high tax rates, people didn’t bother trying to get as rich. After all, there’s no point in bargaining for a giant bonus if the government is going to clip off most of it.... So the real tax rates rich Americans paid in the 1950s may not have been so stratospherically high as some progressives assume. But they also may have helped create a more egalitarian society.</i>

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Yes, this is a great example of how black and white can be better than color. In part because the color here is pretty unnatural anyway.

In fact, when I've shot stage performances with many colored lights I sometimes give up trying to get a decent white balance and just go with black and white - not for the art, not for the pretense, but because the only colors I can get are shit.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Once upon a time, I was a semi-professional photographer of sorts.  I acquired a well-deserved reputation of being much better in the darkroom than behind the camera, at least in black and white.  Much better at making the work of more talented photographers better than in taking the pictures myself.  Both honored that people who were really good would rather have me develop and print their stuff than do it themselves, much less the others and humbled by how much better they were than I could be.  (Honestly, they're why I gave it up).  

And from that perspective, my beef with digital black and white is that the imperfection of film and paper technology is what made black and white great.  It's why it stuck around, decade after decade, after color became a thing.  Far more than is the case with color photography, a great black and white photograph was a product of the limitations of grain structure of the film and the paper, and the freehand hoodoo with dodging and burning done on the fly, while the timer on an enlarger counted down seconds, and even the imperfections that occurred--sometimes deliberately, sometimes serendipitously--as the result of the choice of the film developing fluid and the time-temperature relation.  No digital camera or editing software can really reproduce the imperfection.  

More than that, though, I lament the loss of the process of black and white itself, the way all practitioners of superseded technologies do.  The smell of the chemicals, the delicate work of loading film onto a reel by touch in total darkness.  The elusive, barely perceptible, flash of  triboluminescence when you pulled the tape holding the end of the film strip away from the cassette lose in total darkness.   Printing images by the dim light of an amber lamp. 
The decadent thrill of breaking out the pricey, silver-rich, Ilford paper when doing prints for a show rather than the cheaper Kodak paper.  Rocking a tray while an image magically appeared, waiting for the exact moment when, despite the dim light, your experienced eye told you it needed to be pulled out and put into the stop bath.  

It didn't feel like science or engineering, or even art.  It felt like you were hidden away, safe from the superstitious, ignorant villagers in your sorcerer's dungeon, performing magic.  

That said, that picture of Kevin's is pretty good.

# News comment title:
When to Support Donald Trump: A Handy Guide

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
If Donald Trump should propose something that actually benefits the country rather than a) tears apart Obama's legacy out of pure spite, or b) massages his own twisted sense of self-gratification, I would be inclined to assess soberly.

I realize that 'benefits the country' is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. We seem to have arrived at a true divided country situation. He's unlikely to propose something to benefit both. But I'll cross that bridge if and when we come to it.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
<i>every proposal, every initiative, regardless of its merits as policy.</i>

No serious liberal/progressive has said oppose everything regardless of merit. Straw man. Plus projection.

Palomar Mountain and the related Palomar Observatory is not that far from Orange County and would be a good fit for what you are looking for.

Seeing all the stars and planets in the sky on a clear night with no interference is a humbling experience. Not humbling like make me believe in a god, but humbling from a sheer scale-of-things perspective and our insignificance. 

That's all.

The Problem With Museums

Think of museums as shrines, and this problem goes away. Uniformity is the ideal that helps them fulfill their holy purposes.

One way to break the homogeneity is to ditch the audio tour. Figure out how you feel about an exhibit without anyone's telling you how to feel about it.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Well done IMAX movies probably work better than a static exhibit if you want to feel how it really was. Perhaps some smell generator too, so you can suffocate on the cigarette and cigar smoke, the odour of London smog, etc. (Why do you never see the pea soup smogs in films about London?)

Trump Targets Senator Schumer After Manhattan Terrorist Attack

Well, the ghouls at Fox certainly didn't waste any time, did they?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Just so I have this straight, it is not the time to talk about gun control immediately after a mass shooting, but it is the time to talk about Visas immediately after a terror attack?

I liked the part where Trumpy told the gathering that the F-35 is friggin' <u>invisible</u>.

""You like the F-35? ... You can’t see it. You literally can’t see it. It’s hard to fight a plane you can’t see.....it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it, <b>even if it’s right next to it, it can’t see it</b>.""
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/23/trump-invisible-plane-coast-guard-f-35

It's hard to imagine that the Coast Guard members in attendance didn't come away from this archetypal Trumpian bombast-athon shaking their heads and rolling their eyes because (a) the Coast Guard doesn't <u>have</u> F-35s, (b) it was obvious that their commander-in-chief is a complete buffoon who doesn't know the difference between ""stealthy"" and ""invisible"" and (c) this is the same guy who tried to cut the Coast Guard's already inadequate budget by more than a billion dollars.

Sometimes puerile and stupid is the =point=.  This is 3 minutes, pop/rock'n'roll, right?
I can't imagine this one being better set to Gregorian chants.

Sometimes lyrics matter, sometimes they don't, depending on the listener.  But, I would contend that lyrics are more likely to matter to more listeners if they complement the accompanying music.  And the pop music that has that - music and lyrics that work together - is more likely to last beyond the moment in time it appeared as 'popular'.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Also, the fact that most people don't actually know the lyrics argues that this is true. Doughnuts make my brown eyes blue. I think Seal refuses (refused?) to give the lyrics for his songs because he feels as you do.

Europe Doesn’t Like the Republican Tax Bill

Maybe you guys would be okay if you paid for your own national defense?

Yeah, I thought so.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Excellent use of a talking point from thirty years ago that has been rendered slightly ridiculous by changes in the world.

As late as the 1980s, the US had nearly a quarter million troops in Germany.
The number today is less than 35,000, a reduction by 85%.
http://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-military-personnel-deployments-country/

We were doing pretty well on the ""peace dividend"" front until W squandered 3 trillion dollars on a bootless, feckless war in Iraq.
https://www.pgpf.org/sites/default/files/0184_ally_defense_spending-full_0.gif


But I doubt that anyone in this comment section would argue with the proposition that the US would be just fine if we unilaterally cut the budget of the Department of Defense by a good chunk.

Stop Blaming Boomers. It’s the Greatest Generation That Ruined America.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Yes. And when I started working my 3 part time jobs in the early 80s they promised if I paid DOUBLE into social security than what was needed to pay current beneficiaries, then I would be guaranteed social security when I retired.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I post a lot of comments on this forum that are critical of evangelicals and their decades-old assault on the Constitution, the Civil Rights Act and the separation of church and state, but I'm always careful to call them what they are<b>: <u>extremist</u> <u>Christians</b></u>. 

Why am I careful? Because the majority of Christians in this country aren't flaming forced birthers and raging homophobes who want to subvert the educational system and who think ""MAGA"" means making the entire nation like Selma was back in the late 50's. 

Virtually every one of my friends in the U.S. is a Christian and none of them hold those socioculturally primitive beliefs. Lumping them in with the Bible-bangin' nutjobs is counter productive in the extreme at a time when team building and political cohesion are so critical to the future of America.

So when people talk about ""Boomers"" with no qualifers, and they lump me in with people like Lindsey Graham, David Duke and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, that says a lot about them and jack squat about me.

You chillun better get your shit together if you want to stop the creeping malignancy that is Trumpism in 2018 and 2020. As much as you want to believe that you can do that without us, and that we have nothing meaningful to contribute to that battle, nothing could be further from the truth. That kind of delusional thinking helped put Trump in the oval office in the first place. 

Fear is the mind killer, and ageism, (like racism, sexism and anti-Semitism), is just another form of fear and loathing that's tolerated and fomented by those who should know better and who claim to be the future of our culture..

In 2018, Can We Please Dial Down the Coverage of President Trump’s Tweets?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
<i>Coverage of President Trump’s Tweets</i>

Just to note: We have no idea who is using trump's twitter account. It's communal. According to haberman, the nyts white house reporter and cnn analyst, everybody knows that. Here is haberman saying anybody that doesn't know trump's twitter is a communal account is da stupid:
Maggie Haberman
<i>Whether this is an excuse aside, this is a classic example of something that’s been known for months - that others, primarily Scavino but others, have access to the twitter feed - being treated like a revelation</i>
https://twitter.com/maggienyt/status/937418596313124864

That was in reference to this tweet from somebody other than trump using trump's official twitter account:
Donald J. Trump‏
<i>I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!</i>
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937007006526959618

Here is why that tweet from trump's official account had to be from somebody else:
<i>If true, why then would Trump ask the FBI director to go easy on Flynn, as former FBI Director James Comey later testified? The message set off renewed talk of potential evidence of obstruction of justice.</i>

Trump Nominee Appears to Have Practiced a Wee Bit of Resume Inflation

He sounds at least as qualified as....... 

Ben Carson is to run HUD, or 
Mike Pompeo is to run the CIA, or
Rick Perry is to run the Energy Dept., or 
Wrecks Tillerson is to ruin the State Dept. or
Betsy DeVos is to run the Education Dept., or
Linda McMahon is to run the Small Business Administration, or
Donald J. Trump is to hold the most powerful office on Planet Earth

Lack of qualification is an absolute prerequisite to work in the Trump administration. But more importantly, the dumber and more unqualified the people around him are, the smarter and more capable the POTUS seems.

Stability and Genius!

Yet Another Company Announces One-Time $1,000 Bonuses

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
It's just inflation, 666 had to turn into 1,000 one of these days

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Well, in this case it's only $1000 for 20 year employees, so it's probably pretty arbitrary and not that easy to calculate. The average bonus is only in the $215-$285 range, and the lowest paid employees will mostly see less. I suspect it's mostly a marketing thing.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
My wife and I relapsed and took home two sibling kittens from the local rescue (a tuxedo boy and a seal-point siamese girl). Really forgot how many laps kittens can do around the bedroom at 5 AM.  They are frequently seen in the pose of my avatar as they make their way from the dresser to the bookshelf to the vanity to the bed. 

They're highly bonded and pretty much follow each other everywhere.  Also kind of materialistic. They like toys, stuffed animals, tablet computers with videos of birds. Less interested in and a bit scared of us. A bit like having wild cats in the house at this point. We'll see if they can be tamed a bit so we can take them to the vet when needed.

He's playing nth-dimensional chess, to compensate for the US's lack of chess grandmasters.

(Trump claimed such a lack, but naturally it bears no relation to reality.)

The world will burn in a nuclear conflagration because Donald was such a bad businessman he had to turn to the Russians to stay afloat.

Also, Donald must compensate for his feelings of inadequacy over his tiny man-appendage. 

The way the Congressional Republicans are covering for Donald, Putin must have gotten Kompromat on every last one of them.

# News comment title:
Is Wall Street Nervous About Inflation? It Shouldn’t Be.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Generally correct, although given pricing was up so high, inflation worries are as much an excuse as a real reason.

Certainly while there is (finally) some genuine price pressure and inflation, the past 15 years have amply demonstrated that inflation is something the banking system and central banks are well set up to deal with. Should it get to a sustained 4 percent (itself not terrible) easy to take action. What is hard and not obvious is low inflation as that is best dealt with fiscal policy - spending - and the developed world has itself in a bind there (entirely on board with the theoretical policy framework on spend counter-cyclically, the problem is making it happen in real world - rather like preaching to Journos against their real incentives not to pay attention to idiot memos).

In a world of low inflation, the central bank informal standard of 2%-3% really should be edged upwards to 3-4% for inflation targetting.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
No, only Democratic deficits do that.

Bear market follows bull market. The fundamentals are weak, stocks are overpriced. Dingbats think high stock prices are inherently good. Increased volatility usually means a 'correction' is coming, and dingbats who follow utterances of the DIC will be sad.

At Yosemite, It’s All About the Light

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
If all the light around you is reddish, your brain compensates somewhat and reads the colors as less red.  But a camera won't.

This is very noticeable in indoor photos with incandescent light of course.

Those aren't photos of Half Dome. They're photos of El Capitan being photobombed by Half Dome.

Facebook Accidentally Tells the Truth

""<b>Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough</b>."" 
Mark Zuckerberg

""We do have great products but we still wouldn’t be half our size without <s>pushing</s> ripping the shit out of the envelope on growth.""

There. That's better. Now everybody's telling the truth.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I've hated that bit of moronic wisdom from Zuckerberg, because the stuff he and the other tech messiahs constantly advocate breaking always belongs to other people; other people's markets, other people's businesses, other people's jobs. When the shoe is on the other foot, he doesn't appear to like anyone breaking his stuff.

# News comment title:
We Need More Research Into Race and IQ, Please

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
What's the point? The people who believe that blacks are genetically inferior are too stupid, too twisted and too locked into their racism to be swayed by any actual data. 

And besides, any research that conflicts with socioculturally primitive, right wing values is fake science at best, heretical ranting against the Invisible White Guy in the Sky at worst.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
The problem is the answer to bad pseudoscience isn't better pseudoscience.  It is actual science.

""White"" and ""black"" (and other traditional race terms) are not biological terms.  Specifically, those are not well-defined populations in the biological sense, and actual science has determined that if you go about defining human subpopulations using normal scientific methods, you end up with something quite different from the traditional races.

So that's that.  Once you know that, you can't do meaningful genetic population studies on whites and blacks because those aren't meaningful scientific populations.

That's a really important thing to know.  It is a point we should be making over and over until everyone gets it.  And that means we really shouldn't be doing what Kevin wants, because it is based on a false, and really quite harmful, premise.

Pope Annoys Traditionalists With Call to Holiness

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
If the new/improved Pope truly believed in the tenets of liberation theology, which the Vatican hammered mercilessly under his predecessors, he could demonstrate his authenticity and commitment to socioeconomic justice by selling off the Vatican's priceless trappings, including its mega-collection of artwork and documents from its vast historical library.

The Vatican's matchless materialism makes a mockery of his words.

And while you are shopping for onions at the Safeway feel free to find a mirror and blame yourself for not coming through on border wall funding, not figuring out a deal on DACA, and seceding congressional power to the executive branch for the last 45 years.

Obama wasn't the subject of an FBI investigation. He didn't behave like a petulant adolescent. He didn't send rage-tweets in the middle of the night about the size of his...nuclear weapons.

Of course Dems questioned Obama's leadership plenty of times. For instance, Chuck Schumer claimed it was a mistake to pass Obamacare because it was so costly for Democrats in the midterms. But that's a question of strategy and tactical decisions. They weren't describing Obama as an unstable, unhinged lunatic with zero grasp of policy, because the fact is he wasn't.

# News comment title:
Why Should Progressives Force Big Cities to Become Even Bigger?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I have a number of substantial objections to this grab-bag of sorta-analysis.

One theme that emerges for me is that it seems a little too car-focused (which may be a California flavor).  One of the the advantages of a city -- or at least an east-coast city -- is, it's walkable; you don't NEED a car the way you do in the burbs.  When I lived in NY -- where BTW I didn't mind density or high-rises; in fact, <I>they're among the reasons I moved there</i> -- only about 50% of residents in the city (including outer boroughs) owned cars, and some (like me) didn't even bring them into the city.  Cars <i>aren't necessary</i> in a city, and by the way, traffic in dense suburbs (e.g., NJ, suburban Philly, suburban DC, suburban Boston, and also smaller cities) is often every bit as bad as in the city.

Also, NIMBYism is a problem pretty much everywhere and in all things.  Sure a city dweller doesn't want a high-rise going in next door, but neither does a suburbanite want a McMansion going in next door, or indeed ANY construction nearby.  And traffic is a universal complaint.  Even a small commercial development -- which might allow WALKING in the burbs (as strange a concept as that may sound) -- is met with complaints about there-goes-the-neighborhood AND traffic.

Plus, economies of scale are real, and they don't stop at a million.  Plus also, ""critical masses"" of certain kinds of talent are next to impossible to build in smaller cities.  Plus gerrymandering and political segregation, which has only emerged in the last maybe 3-4 decades. really?  Plus etc. and so on, too.  Feh.

Trump: Cohen “Represented Me” In Stormy Daniels Payoff

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
""Mr. Trump, do you have any comment on Stormy Daniels' lawyer's hint that the $1,600,000 hush-money payment your lawyer made to silence a pregnant bunny on behalf of a wealthy republican donor was really made for <u>you</u>?""

The story ........https://www.rawstory.com/2018/04/attorney-michael-avenatti-hints-1-6-million-abortion-payout-trump-not-gop-donor/

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Trump just screwed both himself and Cohen -- he admitted that Cohen represented him for the Stormy payoff, which is why Avenatti is breakdancing with glee right now, *and* also claimed that Cohen was a businessman who hardly did any other legal work for him, which means that all the stuff the FBI seized the other day is not covered by attorney-client privilege. Not bad for one morning show call-in.

Trump Is Now Fundraising Off Conspiracy Theory That FBI “Infiltrated” His Campaign

# Oldest comment (from the thread):

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I know it sounds like a broken record but if he didn't do anything wrong and he's just as innocent as he says then let the investigation unfold.  Yet he has done nothing but try to stop any investigation into the Russians and his campaign.  And now he's doing everything (including making up fantasies) to obstruct the investigation.  That is not the actions of an innocent by stander.  It has been proven (by multiple national and international sources ) the Russians did influence the 2018 U.S. Presidential election apparently in favor of Trump.  Unless he collaborated with that Russian program, he should have nothing to worry about.

States which depend on agricultural workers need a guest worker program with a more direct path to legal residency for workers and their immediate families. The country needs an improved asylum policy to bring in families whose members are threatened with violence by the drug cartels kept in business thanks to US demand, as well as by military organizations trained by the US military.
Finally, the US has to embark on a development program to assist poorer Latin American governments in recovering from economic hardships resulting from previous US policies in the region.
Then perhaps we can have a conversation about illegal immigration.

Yeah! And we'll all be dead by then anyway, so what business is it of ours if people in Asia and Africa need to feed their kids buckets of rice instead of bowls just to keep them alive? There's nothing worse than First World arrogance.

The uptake of carbon generally increases with elevated CO2. This could have a dilution effect, with starchier, less nutrient dense foods. Well, that's extrapolating wildly from my research in prairie grasses.

I always get roasted when I say this, but fuck it. Better students come from parents who value education and who engage in a conscious effort to stimulate their children's minds. Parents who don't value education and especially don't value critical thinking (hi Republicans) produce disengaged children whom even the most competent teacher can't do much with. 



You want better students you need to start way earlier than the first day of school.

This is great news, Kevin. So happy that you're getting good medical care, and I'm confident that your family are assertive advocates for you. Thank them as well. 

Thanks for continuing to write the best blog (even while you're getting  chemotherapy. Who else would do that?). Thanks as well for sharing your personal journey with all your regular readers. 

Finally, thank you for your lunchtime photo series, and your (all too) occasional (but gratefully appreciated) Hummingbird photos. 

Wishing you continued success on your journey back to completely good health. Peace and prosperity to you and your loved ones.

What Trump’s Plan to Ignore Race in School Admissions Actually Means for Students

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
""To remove the guidances now can only be described as a political attack on efforts to bring communities together and as a policy of separation and division.""

""only"".  Really, this is the only way to describe it?  It doesn't bring communities together when one race is favored over another.  It divides communities.  Favoring one person by race inherently involves disfavoring another person because of their race.  So, it's OK to discriminate against someone based on their race, but it depends on which race, eh?  Can't people see how this is unfair to that person who is discriminated against?  No individual, community, race, or other group can complain when admission decisions are based only on merit and not on qualities of birth that an applicant has no control over.

Of course you are all out' for a level playing field and would gladly make sure all students had enough food, good housing, clothes, medical and dental care, so that all students would be able to compete totally based on their skills and abilities alone, without the added burden of hunger, ill health, insecure housing and poverty.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Please vote. Every state allows voting by mail. I checked. The republican plan is to make voting possible only if you wait in a long line. Don't fall for it. I'm speaking to all Americans but most importantly women, the young and those of African descent. I consider you three groups as our only hope. Please help us out. It is so easy (registering to vote and requesting a mail-in ballot) it takes about 5 min. This could be our last chance. Save our ship. 30 states allow no excuse absentee ballot. 20 states allow absentee ballot with excuse, like on vacation, working out of state or lack of transportation. If you are prepared they can't refuse an absentee ballot. I can't wait to vote this time more than ever in my life.

The Future Is Going to Be Great!

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Sounds like the Epcot ride in the 80’s promising industrial technology would erase hunger, solve pollution, and <insert dream> by 2015.

Maybe they didn’t count on megalomaniac greed and political corruption?

Everything on that list is late; should have had its beginnings decades ago.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
<i>""We’re still a long way away from understanding how all this stuff interacts, but by “long way” I mean maybe a decade or so.""</i>

I'm a molecular biologist, and I think I can state with certainty that we are far, far more than a decade or two away from understanding how the 20,000 or so protein-coding genes plus another 3 billion or so base-pairs of non-coding DNA interact. Not only are we nowhere close to the answers, we're not even sure what the right questions are. We keep discovering new forms of non-coding RNA and different regulatory roles for... everything. And it is almost surely impossible to fully disentangle genetic and environmental effects with complex phenotypic traits.

>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<


Oh, and our microcosm of bacteria, viruses and mites pushing us along...not to mention parasites. I recall, from my Bio 301 classes, that physicists in the 50s just KNEW all of the great questions in physics were answered or on the verge of being answered, so they turned their great brains to biology because, reductio ad absurdum, they could figure our ALL of the great questions in biology in a few quick decades...and, sadly, that paradigm keeps a lot of cyberfolks going strong, as they blithely ignore all the strange things going on in interconnected biological systems.

Been wondering how much the demographic for ancient astronauts programs overlaps with Trump voters.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
She strikes me as a nice young woman, with enough money to indulge every prattling bit of gauzy thought mist that drifts across the windswept prairies of her brain.

If she had no money, I wonder if she would be flitting from one entry-level job to another in a world which sadly didn't even know that it lacked Goop.

To be fair, this is one rando. I would call myself a democratic socialist, but I also wouldn't be caught dead saying that I want to ""Destroy Capitalism."" It's an asinine statement, especially in 2018, when we have no consensus idea of what either ""socialism"" or ""capitalism"" are. I certainly want to kick the living shit out of the idea that the market is either a panacea or the divine arbiter of all justice, and there are certainly a lot of Americans that believe that fool shit. But to argue that markets aren't often more effective at allocating goods than a centralized administration or a popular vote is asinine. There's just too much empirical proof. Just like there's tons of empirical proof that markets aren't always awesome all the time (and that they equal America!). But I guess I gotta use words when I talk to ya, so we're going to spend the next century repeating the same stupid shit ad nauseam instead of just instituting better social policy that actually works to aid people instead of funneling money continually upwards.

Friday Cat Blogging – 3 August 2018

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Few things are as disturbing as a cat's eye, with its vertical pupil. Goat's eyes are even worse, with their horizontal pupils and red irises. (irii?)

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Whenever I sing The Happy Cat Treat Song, my cat comes running.  Early on in our relationship, I sang the song without actually having any treats, just to get him inside and away from another cat I knew he wanted to fight with.  A few minutes after the revelation of my betrayal, I walked into my bedroom and found Kitty squatting on my pillow getting ready to take a crap.  I have not faked the treat song since.

We need to start saying unequivocally that it's not a two way street. There is no moral equivalency. All the black hatred against white people doesn't mean that you, as a white person, have to send your kids to schools with no working heat and no budget for school supplies. No amount of ""reverse-racism"" will ever make the cops jumpy and likely to shoot you just because you're white.

Sure.  The market for labor is not competitive.  Contrary to the assumptions made by generations of economists, employers enjoy significant monopsony power in the labor market.  The solution is for workers to join together to develop countervailing monopoly power of their own; i.e., unions.  Or to use the power of government in the form of minimum wages and similar regulations.

What makes Shapiro her ""equal""? Would he call on Trump to debate him? Does he call on all politicians to debate him? If not, then he is a windbag

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I'm not sure what you're implying, but I did do an extremely hard eye roll, yes. His call to have her on his show has nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman. Were she a man, he would have made the exact same request. It's her far-reaching and sometimes unrealistic ideas he wants to debate, not her gender. As a woman, frankly I find it extremely frustrating when women resort to playing the ""I'm a woman, you can't talk to me like that"" card when it's entirely unnecessary. He was treating her like any other democratic politician he doesn't agree with, she made it about the belittlement of women for no reason. And honestly, if I were a New Yorker, I'd want to know that the person running for Congress actually has a plausible way to carry out her plans, not just saying it because it sounds nice. If she can't hold her own, she shouldn't win the election.

The Great White Con rolls on and on.....right over Trumpy's brain-dead base.

But as long as he and his congressional sock puppets keep fightin' the good fight against all things liberal, secular and regulatory, the ""faithful"" will keep on grabbin' their socks and hollerin' ""Hallelujah!""

Onward Christian soooooldiers
Marching as to war.....

As far as I'm aware, Kevin, you still live in Orange County.

You may not want to admit it, but that's just an extended, yet integral, part of a *gigantic* city.

Your assumption, in fact, is a major part of a slew of problems, starting with climate change and segregation. Take away the automobile, both polluting and allowing whites to escape public transport, and your house is an orange grove.

I don't think that there is a single good quality to this asshole: he's crooked; he's stupid; and he's lazy.

So what he wants to do is awful, but he's not very good at it anyway, and he rarely tries.

Seems like some of this we should be thankful for.

So. The kakistocracy/kleptocracy we have now is immensely corrupt. Soviet style 'socialism' is immensely corrupt. Bruenig proposes a highly modified form of regulated capitalism, so we shall just call it 'soviet-style' kakistocracy and condemn it out of hand. Sorry. Anything that concentrates power is inherently corrupt, but I don't see that indirect government partial ownership of capitalistic ventures is inherently more corrupt except as an ideological meme.  Nonetheless, I think Senator Warren's proposal is more feasible, and Bruenig, M.'s version is less likely.  BUT. It is out there to discuss and as a thought to move towards.

# News comment title:
Trump Urges Evangelicals to Prep for Violence After They Lose Election

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
So reprehensible. It's amazing that we elected a reality tv show host to be president. No government service. No military service. Crazy, crazy, crazy.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Remember, this is coming from the same guy who said the following during the election:

<blockquote>“If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: “Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know.”</blockquote>

This was actually an echo of Sharron Angle's ""Second Amendment solutions"" remark in the 2010 Senate race (which thankfully didn't happen after she lost). If you think about it, the very name of the Tea Party movement is an incitement to violence. Yes, the historical event it references was itself an act of nonviolent civil disobedience--but it was the run-up to armed revolt against the government. The use of the historical analogy implied that Obama's government was illegitimate in the same sense as the British hold on the colonies in the 1700s.

For most of the past generation, the right has essentially refused to recognize the legitimacy of Democrats whenever they win--who are depicted not as the ""other side"" of the political aisle but as mortal enemies who must be destroyed.

Well, of all the places to study efficiency, Russia would NOT be my primary source of information!  The kleptocracy is in full swing there, and we have only partially managed to have private enterprise working to destroy the public sector here. 



Here are a series of articles about whether the public sector is less efficient than the private. Keep in mind that sometimes the article refers to studies. I assume you can look those up for yourself, and don't need me to do that for you. This is as far as I am willing to go with you, so use it or forget it. Here you go:

Note how Trump does this. He isn’t accusing Holt of fudging the tape, he is saying Holt was caught doing it. As if this was something that happened and was in the news some time ago. It truly is “gaslighting”.

Trump’s Tariffs Have Killed Off the Ford Focus

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
As I just posted on another thread, Trump's big mouth appears to have killed off any chance of a trade deal with Canada.....""High-stakes trade negotiations between Canada and the U.S. were dramatically upended on Friday morning by inflammatory secret remarks from Trump obtained by the Toronto Star.""

""In remarks Trump wanted to be “off the record,” Trump told Bloomberg News on Thursday that he is not making any compromises at all in the talks with Canada — but that he cannot say this publicly because “it’s going to be so insulting they’re not going to be able to make a deal.....Trump said that a possible NAFTA deal with Canada would be “totally on our terms.""

“Here’s the problem. If I say no — the answer’s no. If I say no, then you’re going to put that, and it’s going to be so insulting they’re not going to be able to make a deal ... I can’t kill these people,” he said of the Canadian government.........https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/08/31/bombshell-leak-to-toronto-star-upends-nafta-talks-in-secret-so-insulting-remarks-trump-says-he-isnt-compromising-at-all-with-canada.html

The Traumatized Horror of Adolescence

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Shirley nothing less than traumatized adolescent horror would be worthy of Broadway. So it must be different today...

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
If Ms Grady wants to understand (or try to, since she appears to lack a certain depth) the ""traumatized horror of adolescence"" she may want to talk to teenage refugees from, say, Biafra or Rwanda or Burma who have seen their parents raped and killed before them. Not knowing if they are next.

It may put things in perspective for her. And her readers on Vox.

Well, reading all the business articles about how to engage alienated employees, for instance, and how us old folk are increasingly isolated, yes. But I blame consumerism and extreme individualism. Friendship is a product acquired via consumption of friendly goods, and everyone is out to one up everyone else. The Nike NFL ad with Colin K is a case in point

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
It will be pretty impressive if Kavanaugh serves until he is 93.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Also, we all get a big long look at what an unmitigated shit Kavanaugh is. This is not a principled conservative; this is a nasty little ratfucker with absolutely no sense of honor or decorum. The public is seeing that and they're seeing that Republicans don't give a damn and never have, and that for Republicans it was _never_ about some lofty principle or high-minded ideology. For Republicans, it was always about grubbing after power.

Republicans Have a Big Dilemma This Year

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I think 2016 is a stress test of the conventional wisdom that you never lose by winning.  Trump's win is looking likely to fuck up the GOP for a decade or more.

Probably even more this: many Trump voters are Trump voters, not Republican per se. If their candidate isn't Trumpish enough, they won't get super excited about voting. I don't think the Tea Party is as exhilirating as owning the libs

# News comment title:
The Kavanaugh Affair Careened Off a Cliff Today

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
What Whelan's post did was to prove that something happened ""in that bedroom at the top of the stairs.""  It is ridiculous to think that Dr Blasey could have mixed up the guy that attacked her with a guy she socialized with and even visited in the hospital.  The whole Kavanaugh defense seems to be ""silly woman, she's confused.""  That sounds a lot like the mindset of a would-be rapist who sees women as less than.

CNN BREAKING NEWS: Trump Acts Like Adult for Once

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Hey! He did his part. He repeated over and over again how terrible he felt about poor ol' Brat Kavanaugh's treatment without ever mentioning Ms. Ford by name or expressing one iota of compassion for her. 

My guess is that one of his underlings was able to convince him that it would be a really-really bad idea for someone who has been accused of sexual assault by 16 women......many of whom he attacked viciously and repeatedly for complaining......to do anything that could fire up that story again with just 46 days until the mid terms and female voters already abandoning the GOP in ever increasing numbers.

Remember what you see in the coming days, women voters of America. Ask yourself which party is trying to take rights, freedoms and protections away from you and your families and which one is fighting to protect them.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Sorry, WTF? simply not calling her a slut and too ugly to fuck is now ""respectful""? Respectful enough that his aides are ""quietly stunned""? I call bullshit on that whole article. It's not news, it's a fucking press release. 
Here's what he actually did: completely denied the validity of her story, impugned her credibility and continued to promote as unimpeachable (pun fully intended) the character of the guy accused. The ONLY FUCKING THING HE DID DIFFERENT is a couple of half hearted ""we'll see"" comments when press asked him his thoughts about an investigation. Which he is *refusing* to ask the FBI to conduct.
So, no. No fucking way is this respect. And comparing it to the actions of a third grader is insulting to 8 year olds.

# News comment title:
Cultural Studies Is the Target of Another Hoax — And This One Stings

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
I think the most questionable claim here is the supposed openess of “leading journals”.

My understanding is that most of the journals in question here aren’t even second tier in their repsective professions. Largely pay to play

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
In fairness, having published and reviewed for engineering and physics journals,  the peer review process in those areas isn't all it's cracked up to be, either.  But, the real point here is that advocacy and science, or even advocacy and rigorous academic study, are fundamentally incompatible.  The social sciences have lost a lot of credibility because anyone can accurately guess the conclusion of studies performed by many economists and sociologists just by learning the researcher's political affiliation.  That fact alone is incredibly damning.

Chinese Military at Center of Massive US Server Hack

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Interesting. I'm going to have to read the article later.

I know Facebook, Google, Amazon and also Apple basically design and build their own servers now, for cost and other reasons. I wonder if security is one of those reasons.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Be careful with this. Very knowledgeable tech people are starting to call bullshit on this article and believe the reporter may have fallen victim to a deliberate misinformation campaign being orchestrated by the White House. FWIW, Amazon, Apple and others have issued plausible WTF rebuttals.

# News comment title:
Among Women, the Gender Gap Against Republicans Is Now 14 Points

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
51% of men are imbeciles?  Sounds about right.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Not on here, but on Twitter, I'm noticing an interesting (but infuriating) backlash that I'm assuming is from the past few weeks of women speaking loudly. There are increasingly more posts that downgrade women's accomplishments or imply that women are ""lesser"" than men overall. At first I thought I was just being hypersensitive, and I'm not saying that that might not be part of it. And these comments are coming from the conservative side, and in many cases from real idiots anyway.

But it's beginning to feel like the 1970's again. McConnell is calling the Kavanaugh protesters ""clowns"". And limitations on women's abilities are being stated very matter-of-factly. The following is a bad example, not least because Taylor Swift is not my kind of music, but it's one of the more obvious examples. Usually the innuendos are harder to quantify, out of context.

After she came out in favor of a Democratic candidate, and explained her reasoning logically & coherently, there was the usual backlash. But within the predictable comments were things like calling her a ""mediocre woman"" or implying that she shouldn't be telling ""hardworking Tennesseans"" what to do.

Like her music or not, ""mediocre"" is ridiculous. And anyone who knows anything about writing, recording & producing music, let alone touring with a huge roadshow (including choreography) and doing publicity, would know that she probably works harder than most of those Tennesseans. You don't garner numerous awards for numerous albums, with many songs she wrote herself, and amass a net worth of over $300 million in 12 years of performing, by sitting around twirling your hair. And it was very reminiscent of Chuck Grassley stating that the GOP side of the Judiciary Committee had no women (and never had) because it was probably too much work for them (there's another example!).

For many of you it might be easy to suggest that these jerks just be ignored. But again, I remember the 70's, when it was news & had to be emphasized that of course women could be doctors, attorneys, CPA's (not ""just"" bookkeepers), engineers, etc. That our place wasn't only in the home or on the boss' lap. As I'm assuming people of color feel right now, too, we've fought these fights -- over and over and over -- and now we're going back again, and it's happening FAST.

So, much longer post than intended, but please -- if you see others or yourself starting to use a more diminishing tone towards women, please push back. I don't think I have the heart to go through the 70's again.

# News comment title:
Study Suggests Richer Countries Are More Gender Divergent

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
This is not a topic I want to wade into.  Hence, I’m going to take a tangent.  We have Beveridge’s law for headlines posed as yes/no questions.  Is there an analogous law for A or B choiced questions?  I.e., is it A or B?  Answer: both or somewhere in between. How about a law for self-reflexive questions?  Am I being jerk?  Am I taking us off topic?  Answer: yes.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Being female and perhaps shielded a bit from the slings of PC culture simply because of my gender, I will bravely wade in. 

With my waders on, I note the psychological characteristics discussed are Europatriarchal gender expectations. Not surprisingly. Europatriarchal cultures, which are richer, display more Europatriarchal gender expectations. The validity of this study is probably as good as economic studies of consumer behavior based on white male college students in American universities. I also note that there is a lot of culturally enforced gender disparity in the US, which of course feminism seeks to address. It really doesn't matter how rich you are in the US, gender norms are still rigorously policed for most people.

When we stop telling people how to behave depending on what their physiology is, and we have at least one generation of purely neutral expectations of our children, then and only then can we see if there truly are such divergent gender characteristics. And at that point we probably won't care.

I also want to point out that the study addresses behavioral characteristics, not intellectual capabilities.

Obama Is Doing the Political Rally Thing All Wrong

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Obama cant do what needs to be done. He did it already. It wont work for him again.

I dont see him leading chants of Lock Him Up and Deport the Illegal Melania.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
I for one am shocked that Barack Obama is acting like Barack Obama.


Why would you expect Obama to not be Obama?  This is who he was when we chose him to be the Democratic presidential nominee, when we elected him president, and then when we re-elected him president.  This is who the man is, not some kind of mask that he puts on for our benefit.


If you want political leaders who are going to breathe fire you are going to need to look for new politicians.  What has historically made for a successful Democratic politician is a technocratic wonk who can show empathy and is also very much of a ""if we all work together we can move mountains"" sort of bent.  So you aren't going to find a whole lot of firebreathers in the Democratic party right now because, for the past few decades at least, voters haven't actually elected them into office or kept them there for very long if they did.


You can wish that we had politicians like that or you can work to get them elected.  But it's on the voters that our politicians aren't like that, and if you don't recognize that fact you aren't going to get very far in changing things.


Contrast with Republicans where abject morons can reach high office if they are good enough at the firebreathing to stir up their voters.  That's because Republican voters respond to different things than Democratic ones do, and if you want politicians with the kinds of personalities that Republicans routinely elect you need to figure out how to get Democratic voters to not start looking for the exits when it comes to supporting them.

Trump Says Synagogue Shooting Could Have Been Prevented With “Armed Guards”

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Trump is a clearly insane individual.  It must be at least somewhat disconcerting, even to his most ardent supporters, that now sitting in office is a man who is not in control of his mind and his actions.  
We have overheard senators talking about how the man is insane.  We know his own employees have discussed having him removed from office.
We are not safe with the Orange Lunatic at the helm.  Many are having fun watching this Monkey With a Machine Gun ruin democracy.  But, it is, in fact, a threat to all that is decent and respectable about our nation.

Did the president just say that America is now a country where it's only safe to go about your daily life under armed guard?

# News comment title:
Just How Progressive Is Nancy Pelosi?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Given there doesn’t seem to be a similarly long tail to “liberal” is bucket position really the apt comparison?

As for these newly elected progressives, since the don’t have voting records, is their rhetoric more liberal/progressive/whatnot than the historical voting record?  Were there enough of their ilk in Congress often enough in the past to generate such a long tail to the left?

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Agreed on both. Go back and check her record as Speaker under Obama. You won't see any failures there - at least nothing to compare with her successes (the Affordable Care Act, the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, et al.). And Pelosi herself is considering her role to be a ""transitional"" one - expect to see a lot of grooming of the Next Gen of Dem leadership in 2019 (they need to get a viable presidential candidate, too).

We need young people, younger than I am (70) , in leadership positions and out front, with us old codgers giving them the benefit of our experience. With each other, not against each other. Pelosi needs to be actively training new leadership.

Military Experts Say We Should Cut Medicare to Fund Bigger Military

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Of course they aren't primary drivers: Military is good spending; only bad spending like welfare can add to the deficit.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Guys, all I know is that ten years ago we were spending six times as much as China and now we're only spending three. Now, I know what you're going to say: China needs to spend more money because it's modernizing its military, whereas most of our costs ought at most to go for upkeep. Maybe you'll also ask why we even need a military this large, given we haven't been attacked by a major power on our shores in over seventy five years, and we haven't fought a decent war since then, either. But none of that changes the fact that I, a Republican, am scared by whatever this week's bogeyman is!

# News comment title:
Here’s Some *Real* Advice For Dealing With Your Angry Uncle

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
My mother apparently instituted a new policy for Thanksgiving 2016. No politics in the house.

Given that this is Boston in late November, I believe it's been pretty effective.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
""My gut instincts, which have nothing to do with my professional training, are pretty solid.""  Yeah, why go to trouble of actually studying something when you can just rely on ""gut instincts"" to get you through -- that's Trump's approach to the presidency right there.

Kevin, you've buried the lede, as the journalists say. Your footnote #2 is the real story here.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
1. Greenwald does not deserve this much attention.
2. Damned if I'm giving Greenwald the clicks, but did he even mention the amount of money with which Saudi Arabia has been, is and will be bribing Trump and his family?

NRF Flacks Can’t Agree On Whether Holiday Shopping is Strong or Weak

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Oh Kevin - just stop with all the numbers and such.
Embrace it.
The numbers are up if you need them to be to make a point, and they're down if you need them to make a different point.

Let's Trumpify the example to give you a sense of what I mean:

BIGGEST SHOPPING DAY IN HISTORY!  But Failing CNN won't report it.  Very Unfair and SAD!

OR....

See?  I told you that if the Dems retook the House of Representatives that the economy would tank.  Terrible start to the holiday shopping season.  SAD

Like that. :)

# News comment title:
Most Studies of Social Interventions Are Pretty Worthless

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
So I guess we can let community and church-based interventions continue, though we'd better keep a close eye on them, lest they get out of hand!

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Embedded in your post is the real reason these efforts fail when attempts are made to scale them up.
It is a ""one size fits all"" solution - but local problems aren't ""one size fits all.""  That's just not how you fix them. 
Sure, you can design a small scale solution to a local problem and have it work well.  Happens all the time.
But when you try to copy and paste that exact same solution to some different group where there are a different set of realities and constraints in play...nope.  It's not going to work as well, and things will get worse if you try to do it across an incredibly broad area.

Rather than scalability, these programs would see vastly more success if they adopted the approach of REPLICABILITY, which is fundamentally different.  A series of small scale initiatives with the freedom and flexibility to adjust to the prevailing conditions of the locality while accomplishing the same basic goal.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Reminds me of lawyers and their legalese... they make it so hard for most people to get at what they write or say, but they sure as heck want only ""just answer 'yes' or 'no'"" to their queries. Would like to see a study on the nuances of female and male lawyer and politician's brains.

<I>In this case, for example, the authors should say, clearly and up front, that sex differences in the brain are real and important, and <u>then</u> explain just how much practical difference they make and how they interact with social stereotypes and cultural cues. </I>
I think that the flaw in this logic is that researchers don't really know how much practical difference any of these sex differences make. They can't separate out the biological differences at the time the people are studied from the environmental shaping that's occurred throughout people's lives.
Here's a classic example: there are structural differences in the brains of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as compared to people without that diagnosis. But researchers can't say for sure that the structural differences *cause* the Schizophrenia, or if changes in the function of the brain which manifests as schizophrenia then goes on to cause the structural changes.

I would say there is a very large portion of the population that thinks men are human and women are less than fully human. See Peterson, Jordan, for example. Or evolutionary biologists. They claim to base this on totally real biology. 

Just as there is a very large portion of the population that thinks whites are human and blacks (or other ""races"") are less than fully human. See Murray, Charles. And they too claim to base this on totally real biological facts.

Universal healthcare will probably not affect the nurses' pay, but may mean surgeons won't be able to afford Maseratis, and Big Phrma companies won't make huge profits while consumers can't afford insulin or epipens or cancer treatment, etc.

What stupid charts. It's idiotic to lump the top 50% of income earners into one group. Anyone who thinks this kind of pious drivel is useful will also be anxious to bestow this Christmas gift on someone they love:

<i>""But all the evidence I’ve seen suggests that people simply don’t care that other people are worse off than they are.""</i>

I think it is a bit more complicated than that.  Many in the middle class have a deep-seated fear of falling out of the middle class.  In that sense, they are keenly aware that other people are worse off than they are and they are terrified of joining them.

He bragged about how much of a raise the military got... And that didn't work well. The stock market is symbolic and magic and is like the Wizard of Oz to people. Wages, on the other hand, are real and in hand and are not paying for as much as they used to, like the man behind the curtain. Can't lie about wages.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Of course there are ''hang-overs'' from many decades of self-fulfilling propaganda about how ''smoking this stuff will make you crazy!''  As with any ''drug,'' set and setting are incredibly important when it comes to ''effect.''
Take away the ''I'm a criminal because I'm smoking this'' angle (and the accompanying ''paranoia angle"") and I bet the stats go DOWN.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
There is a lot of BS being peddled in this latest effort to re-criminalize Cannabis.


If Cannabis was the danger presented by the author, we would see it in accident statistics and drug-related fatalities.


But we don't.


Alcohol, cigarettes and opioids all kill far more than cannabis.


The crime rates going up in Colorado correlate with the opioid epidemic, not cannabis use.

Does Marijuana Cause Schizophrenia?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Thanks for that bit of sanity, K.D.

""About 10-15 percent of teens who try marijuana become dependent. This is roughly similar to the rate for alcohol dependency."" ......But a dependency is not the same as an addiction.........


""When people use the term “dependence,” they are usually referring to a physical dependence on a substance. Dependence is characterized by the symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal. While it is possible to have a physical dependence without being addicted, addiction is usually right around the corner.""

""Addiction is marked by a change in behavior caused by the biochemical changes in the brain after continued substance abuse."" ....... https://www.addictioncenter.com/addiction/addiction-vs-dependence/


I don't claim to be a neurologist or an addictions specialist, but I haven't seen any credible data that suggests excessive marijuana causes the same kind of changes in the brain that alcohol abuse can cause, nor are marijuana ""withdrawals"" as challenging as alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Am I wrong?

Thanks for that bit of sanity, K.D.

""About 10-15 percent of teens who try marijuana become dependent. This is roughly similar to the rate for alcohol dependency."" ......But a dependency is not the same as an addiction.........


""When people use the term “dependence,” they are usually referring to a physical dependence on a substance. Dependence is characterized by the symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal. While it is possible to have a physical dependence without being addicted, addiction is usually right around the corner.""

You are saying that correlation is not causation.  Do you think that people who are compulsive pot users are merely compulsive?  I don't see any research that supports either side of this.

I have to disagree. I don't think Trump and his tower trash crime family are going to escape massive fines for tax evasion/fraud brought by the AG of the Southern District of New York that could run into hundreds of millions of dollars and might require forfeiture of big name real estate holdings. Hitting Trump in the wallet would be excruciatingly painful and could change his life substantially

The actual rubric is ""make the deals we must with those who have the most pricing leverage, extort from those who have the least""


Pretty much a reverse Robin Hood in practice.


If ten people get that procedure at that hospital, those covered by the largest insurers will be charged the least, and those with no insurance will pay the most.  Almost no one will pay the fee shown in the table, and the variance is large.

There's more to this. This wasn't a Pelosi solo trip it seems. It was bipartisan, GOP members going too. And some of them were literally on a bus to the airport from the Capitol when it happened. I'm not sure of details but take a look at this Fox reporter's Twitter...

""Members are sitting on the USAF bus on CapHill they wait to see if they are departing on overseas trip Trump canceled. 

Fox is told there are furious calls going back and forth now between the Hill, State, Pentagon and White House.""

No Liberal Equivalent of the Federalist Society? Please.

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Comparing the ACLU and the NAACP to the Federalist society is like comparing the Sierra Club to Koch Industries.  There is a big difference in advocating for a fairer society than in advocating for a political party and political agenda.  Both the NAACP and the ACLU have defended Republicans as well as Democrats.  When was the last time the Federalist society defended a Democrat or a Democratic cause?  Hell, when was the <b>first</b> time?

Ocasio-Cortez Takes Facebook, Microsoft, and Google to Task for Conference Promoting Climate Denial

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
It's a shame when giants like Google and Facebook help the Rethuglicon agenda. Glad Congresspeople are calling them out on it.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
It's amazing to me that anyone can still think of Google, Facebook or Microsoft as being possessed of social consciences. What they are is mega-corporations. Corporate entities do not have social (or any other kinds of) consciences. Their concerns are profit, return to shareholders and market share. If pretending to ""care"" about this or that cause furthers any of those concerns then, fine, it doesn't cost anything much to pretend. Don't expect them to actually give a shit, though.

# News comment title:
What’s Up With Howard Schultz?

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
My theory is that once you have all that money and all that ego, you are looking for the next metaphorical mountain to climb.

So instead of learning hang-gliding or becoming a Mahjong master, the newest fad among the billionaire class is to run for president.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Brian Beutler gets it right:

<blockquote>Schultz is just one billionaire, but he’s standing in here for a small but astonishingly powerful class of individuals who whose actions over the past two-plus years belie the sincerity of their anti-Trump comments. Schultz, like other public-facing billionaires, may genuinely believe that Trump is unacceptably racist and incompetent, but he and they also apparently believe that the only thing worse than a catastrophe like Trump is a tax level high enough restore public faith in the American political system.

Schultz himself has spent the week treating popular ideas like tuition-free public college (which would not be very expensive) and single-payer health insurance (which many countries pay for handily, and would mostly just move money we already spend on to the federal balance sheet) like ludicrous pipe dreams. He calls plans to reduce inequality—by raising the top tax rate to where it once was, or by taxing exorbitant wealth like they do in some European democracies—“un-American” and “extreme.”

In this way, Schultz resembles the global plutocratic elites who last week welcomed Brazil’s new president, the aspiring tyrant Jair Bolsonaro, to Davos, then mocked the growing international clamor for higher marginal tax rates on the rich, called critics communists, and brushed off responsibility for inequality, war, and climate change. He also resembles the executives who theatrically withdrew from Trump’s now-aborted economic advisory panels after Trump praised the Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, VA, then participated without fanfare in a gross GOP propaganda campaign to help Trump tout his multi-trillion dollar corporate tax cut.

Schultz’s candidacy is a counterpoint to corporate America’s winking complicity with Trump’s agenda. It’s a warning from donors to Democrats not to respond to Trumpism with an appeal to working-class solidarity—a threat to boobytrap the applecart if Democrats promise to upset it.

My simple litmus test to gauge Trump's (or any other Republican's) bipartisan sincerity:

Reference to ""Democrat Party"", or
Use of ""Democrat"" as an adjective.

If they cant be bothered to show the barest amount of respect by simply managing to refer to their opposing party by its, you know, actual name -""Democratic Party"" - then why should they deserve the presumption of sincerity?

We certainly haven't heard anyone rally to the shared sacrifice banner. Governments have been playing incrementalist footsie with climate change. Few in politics are really fundamentally scared. I really don't think that the shared sacrifice bit will kick in until a lot of people are fundamentally scared and fighting climate change ends up being a real right now 'our homes are burning/drowning' emergency. I am pessimistic about massive political change because it requires a massive change in how people think in a time frame of less than a decade.

El Nino and La Nina are 'related to temperature', which of course wasn't what you said before.

I will note that the reports issued by the <u>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</u> are discussions of the causes and effects of climate change and possible palliative action.

# News comment title:
“Fox and Friends” Describes Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras as “3 Mexican Countries”

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Enough picking on the good, solid citizens who comprise Fox and Friends! If they make some mistakes, well, that is easily understood if you can just take into account that they are a group of of brainless, gibbering morons.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
Well, if you say ""Central America"" to the average Trump worshiper, they probably think ""Kansas"". The good folks at Fox wouldn't want to confuse their followers like that.

# News comment title:
The Mueller Report: A Detailed Account of Trump’s Lies and Misconduct

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
The endless parade of criminal activity glossed by legality-ism. The prurience of corruption floating the sweetly foetid scent of decay.

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
“Why mention it if it is not a deal?” Trump said, despite the fact that a letter of intent had already been signed. In other words, Trump was willing to lie about a substantial conflict of interest.""

Conflict of interest? Trump was offering Putin a $50,000,000 penthouse on the top of the proposed tower and had been making noises about softening sanctions against Russia. 

This is attempted bribery of the leader of a hostile foreign power and a possible national security decision being proposed as a quid pro quo to grease the wheels of a secret business deal, not because it's in the best interests of the nation........ That's not a conflict of interest. It's a criminal conspiracy.

watson really needs to learn what ""free speech"" is and what it is not. free speech is NOT the ability to say what you want, whenever and where ever you want without consequences.
the consequences here are that he violate fb's terms of service that he accepted when he signed up.
there are many curtailments to ""free speech"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions

# Most liked comment (from the thread):
It is alway funny to me when ""WHITE NATIONALISTS"" say ""MINORITIES"" are bad for the economy.  California is 5th largest economy in the world, $3 trillion dollars.  American Latino's are the 11th largest economy in the world.  California is a ""SANCTUARY STATE"", it is ""MINORITY MAJORITY"", it is only 37% White, Latinos are the Majority, more languages are spoken other than English, that in any other State.  It is ""CULTURALLY DIVERSE"".  There is a 20 Billion dollar surplus in the State and the median home price is $550,000.   Compare that with the ""90% White States"" and the ""WHITE SUPREMACY"" argument falls apart.   CALIFORNIA is the bane of the WHITE SUPREMACY thinking, it turns it upside down.
