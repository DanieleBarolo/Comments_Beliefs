Danley wasn’t forthcoming about her life, and Paddock was aggressively unfriendly, McKay recalls. She only saw him in the mornings, when he went to the club house to work out. Occasionally, he would open the garage door, revealing a large refrigerator safe. Other than that, the couple kept their blinds closed.\n\n“He was weird. Kept to himself,” said McKay, 79, who described Paddock as small but in pretty good shape. “It was like living next to nothing…You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet. He never went out in back and enjoyed the backyard, nature. They had a little backyard, 17 feet to the fence and hill. But the blinds were always closed.”\n\nMcKay said the couple was gone for six months last year, which she thought was for a gambling trip.\n\nPaddock’s family said there was nothing in his past that would suggest violence. Family members said that Paddock spent much of his retirement in recent years staying in hotels in Las Vegas and gambling. They said he listened to country music and went to concerts at Vegas hotels, similar to the one Sunday night where he opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers.\n\nPublic records show the gunman Paddock was a licensed pilot who owned two planes. And he had a hunting license from Alaska.\n\nUpdate — 8:50 a.m. PDT:\n\nUpdate — 8:55 a.m. PDT:FBI contradicts claim from Islamic State:\n\nUpdate — 8:53 a.m. PDT:\n\nUpdate — 8:41 a.m. PDT:Updated casualty count:\n\nUpdate — 8:25 a.m. PDT:Tremendous response from the community:\n\nUpdate — 8:24 a.m. PDT:More details and images from eyewitnesses:\n\nUpdate — 8:17 a.m. PDT:Joe Biden has some thoughts.\n\nUpdate — 8:12 a.m. PDT:\n\nUpdate — 8:08 a.m. PDT:Left has already dropped all pretense of not politicizing the attack.\n\nUpdate — 8:06 a.m. PDT:Candidate for NV Gov. starts fundraiser for victims:\n\nUpdate — 8:04 a.m. PDT:\n\nUpdate — 7:54 a.m. PDT:President Trump orders flags flown at half-staff.
