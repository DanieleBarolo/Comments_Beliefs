PARENT COMMENT:
Because Trump is the target of a purely political prosecution does not mean he's the best candidate.   They are not related.

Mr DeSantis,
You want to be president?
Come out tomorrow and announce you will not run this election and you will back Trump 100%.
You've done a fantastic job in Fl and the country needs more of that.
Back Trump in this election and you'll get 78 million votes in the next one.
Stand up for the law and the will of the people.
