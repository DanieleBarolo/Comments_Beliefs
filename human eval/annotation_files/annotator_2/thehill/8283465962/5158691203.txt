Michigan votes not balancing in  enough proof for an investigation

The affidavits follow a long, roller coaster meeting Tuesday, where canvassers were told that 70% of Detroit's 134 absentee counting boards were out of balance by one to more than four votes. 

During Tuesday's meeting, an elections official said countywide, the precincts were out of balance by a few hundred votes in a county that saw 878,000 votes total on Nov. 3. The Democratic stronghold county backed Biden over Trump 68%-31%

There's a reason Guiliani and Powell are laying out their case in a press conference instead of a courtroom.

PARENT COMMENT:
No proof.

That is the Republican's  problem.

Agreed?

Why are the Democrats discouraging people from investigating the election? It appears they have something to hide. If no illegal votes or Fraud was committed, it will show in the Courts.
