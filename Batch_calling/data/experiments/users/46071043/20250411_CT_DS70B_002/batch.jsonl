The issue isn't just about credit cards or banking.\u00a0 The supreme court is basically saying that it's OK for companies to weasel out of obeying the law by putting arbitration agreements in contracts because, hey, the contract is voluntary.\u00a0 You can decide you don't want credit cards but this kind of stuff happens in all kinds of situations already - e.g. employment contracts.\u00a0 When every big company has arbitration clauses in their employment contracts are we supposed to just not work?\u00a0 I don't want to go completely off the grid because every company now feels that they can skirt the law by using arbitration clauses.\n\n<blockquote>... by ignoring several precedents, the majority is providing\n companies \u201cevery incentive to draft their agreements to extract \nbackdoor waivers of statutory rights.\u201d That is, they will use contracts \nto immunize themselves from laws they don\u2019t like.</blockquote>\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOf course a courtoom is another reality, \u00a0just as a surgical operating room is.\u00a0 In both instances, the procedures can be complex and difficult to understand, but they follow tested rules that are subject to improvement. They also have what I hope are consensus goals: improved health and justice. Sometimes they fail: the criminal court system is overwhelmed and in some ways I agree is dysfunctional, especially if the defendant cannot afford private counsel. But class actions are not a sign of dysfunction, and keeping valid claims out of court by making them economically infeasible to bring is not a bow to dysfunctional courts but to big business.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022China\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Diversity\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
