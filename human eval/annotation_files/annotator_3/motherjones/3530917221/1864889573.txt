I wish people would stop equating the lies of journalists with the lies of politicians.  They're not the same.  Not that one is better than the other, they're just different.  


Actually, one is worse than the other.  We expect politicians to lie, but we expect journalists to not only be truthful but to uncover the lies of politicians and others in positions of authority.

One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .

PARENT COMMENT:
True, Hillary said that Iraq had WMDs.  She should have never been elected as a Senator.

  Hopefully not, but ironic isn't it that he is the only one fired for lying about the Iraq War
