Ron Paul just got 28% in the straw poll. Considering how divided our country is, and how third parties are meaningless, that 28% of Republicans\u00a0can be thought of as 14% of the general electorate. He is not given enough airtime just like Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader are ignored when they run for president. You're letting your political beliefs get in the way of your judgment. And as far as that goes, Ron Paul's foreign policy would be much closer to a progressive foreign policy than four more years of Obama. Fact.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nApparently I have had the \"wrong\" impression about Mother Jones journalists / journalism. Certainly KD does not appear to fit.

First, the switch to a consumption base would eliminate the influence of taxes on the timing of con- sumption. Second, the new system might treat different sources or uses of income more uniformly by including more of them in the tax base and subjecting all of them to similar tax rates. Third, a broader base would allow lower overall marginal tax rates, thereby reducing the amount by which taxes affect relative prices and hence all kinds of economic decisions. Society must put up with taxes if it desires government-provided goods and services. But the less the tax system influences the choices that consumers and businesses make, the more efficient that system will be, and the better off society will be.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Right about the time we saw massive decreases in top marginal tax rates, at the same time that politics swung hard right. Deregulation became a constant drumbeat. \"Get the government off our backs,\" (translation - stop using government power to counteract the power of the rich). The overarching political\u00a0philosophy\u00a0became unashamedly grasping and contemptuous of anyone uncynical enough to believe it was about anything other than coddling the powerful and screwing everyone else. In a word, class warfare unleashed, with the middle class as the target.\n\nIt's taken a while , but by now even the Soma-addled masses are starting to notice. As money and power have\u00a0accumulated\u00a0at the top, the incongruities and stress on the 99% are impossible to hide, while the naked power of the rich (the unstoppable 2008 bailouts, HAMP's bald purpose to save the banks at the expense of everyone\u00a0else, the inevitable presidential nomination of an equity kleptocrat on the GOP side)\u00a0increasingly shows through.\n\nKevin is too polite to put it as\u00a0coarsely\u00a0as I'm doing here, but honestly, why are we pretending it's a conundrum?

The first irony is that they care about anybody's life besides their own. The second one is that they think government needs to be a positive force in this regard. If government is only good for enforcing some arcane beliefs about cellular sanctity while leaving tens of millions without health care coverage, it's a safe bet that there is no rhyme, reason, or logic to any of this beyond its ad hoc moralism. \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nsutji \u2026 the point is: you asked \u2026 Did you read his book ?

And I believe that these people who are not, as I say, the hardcore of the Republican Party but who are a certain percentage of the Republican Party, I think these people can be appealed to by a new party. You know, many polls over the years have shown that when you ask Americans to classify themselves as Democrats or Republicans or independent, huge number of them classify themselves as independent\u2014they only vote Democrat or Republican because they have to, because they don\u2019t see an alternative.

Change the System! Activism! Wait, it's not supposed to work that way -- we have local, state and federal \"representatives\" who run our government and country the way we want. If they really did their jobs, we would go through them and get action.\n\nBut they don't do their job. Instead of spending every waking moment trying to impress us with real deeds, they are full time running for reelection. They have the unbeatable advantage of the incumbent of using our taxes and influence to stay in their dream jobs. The President spending $700,000 of taxpayer money for a \u00a0two hour, three plane, 200 person campaign visit to Iowa is mirrored at every level by town supervisors, governors, etc.\u00a0\n\nIf we both demanded a \"report card\" showing 40 hours of work every week representing us, and got an absolute, \"go to jail\" prohibition on spending ten seconds, ten minutes or any influence on campaigning to stay in any office, they would have to listen.

Capitalism is not a political system and our economic health should not be attended at the level of career political campaigns. \u00a0Secondly, our national wealth should be guarded and managed as though it belongs to all of us, which by virtue of our labor in developing it and mining it as well as our sacrifices in dieing to defend it, does, in fact belong to us all. \u00a0Oil, gas, minerals and even some services such as a basic telephonic and media communications system should be Nationalized.\n\nThere is no \"reset\" in our system as far as a place and time that we can go back to to refresh our national health. \u00a0There has never been such a point in time. \u00a0We have been a criminal economy since the beginning and our covenant is a sham and that means that there is no way to restore anything. \u00a0We must start over using the premises that were supposed to be our foundation but this time with institutionalized guarantees and sanctions that enable real controls and punishments for those who would seek to enrich themselves at the expense of our \"common good\" national identity.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nCapitalism ?\n\n\"In conclusion,\u00a0history\u2019s great capitalist thinkers\u00a0would likely be aghast at the modern history of banking system bailouts.

Paradoxically, it may be that we need to lose money in order to preserve capitalism rather than simply engaging in ever more massive bailouts.\"\n\nRalph T.

(The particular issue that drove him over the edge was that of theodicy). So when Bart Ehrman explains that \"vast majority of professional accept that a man named Jesus walked the streets of Roman Palestine.\" he is validating precisely that --- some guy named Jesus walked about Roman Palestine, probably got involved with the authorities, probably got crucified. He's not validating anything more --- born of a virgin, performed miracles, raised on the third day, etc etc.\n\n(b) \"does it really matter so much if he\u2019s based on a historical person? Why does this evoke such strong feelings, and such acrimonious arguments, from atheists?\"\n\nAndrew Sullivan is, as far as I know, the only one who is claiming this evokes strong feelings and acrimonious argument. I know plenty of atheists and none of them have a problem with the historical claim that some guy named\u00a0Jesus walked about Roman Palestine, just like they have no problem with the claim that some guy named Mohammed walked about Arabia, that some guy named Joseph Smith walked around upstate New York, and that some guy named L Ron Hubbard walked around the streets of Washington DC.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe point of the article - the point of the majority of responses - no evidence - doesn't matter.\n\nOf course the opposite is true.

Statute for Religious Freedom\n\nBarton cites Jefferson's Bible incorrectly - but more so, Jefferson nearly kept that private while Barton ignores one of his proudest achievements: The Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom,\nwhich reveals from this author of the Declaration of Independence, (his) views on people's rights, changing laws, and ultimately our right to our private relationship with religion.\n\n* * * Of all of Jefferson's accomplishments, he assigned three to his self-designed Epitaph: * * *\n\n(Near the end of his life, probably when he prepared and signed his final will in March 1826, Thomas Jefferson designed his own gravestone and prepared the text to be engraved on it.\u00a0)\nHere was buried Thomas Jefferson: Author of the Declaration of American Independence\u00a0Of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom\u00a0& Father of the University of Virginia.\n\n\n* * * Please follow the link or read, below, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom * * *\n\nhttp://www.vahistorical.org/sva2003/vsrf.htm\n\n\nI. Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishment or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was his Almighty power to do . . .\n\nThe second paragraph is the act itself, which states that no person can be compelled to attend any church or support it with his taxes. It says that an individual is free to worship as he pleases with no discrimination.\n\nII. Be it enacted by the General Assembly, that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\n\nThe third paragraph reflects Jefferson's belief in the people's right, through their elected assemblies, to change any law. Here, Jefferson states that this statute is not irrevocable because no law is (not even the Constitution). \n\nFuture assemblies that choose to repeal or circumscribe the act do so at their own peril, because this is \"an infringement of natural right.\" Thus, Jefferson articulates his philosophy of both natural right and the sovereignty of the people.\n\nIII. And though we well know that this assembly elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the act of succeeding assemblies, constituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation, such as would be an infringement of natural right.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They could have been stupid and incompetent.\n\n\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThere was some interesting reading at RedState this weekend. It seems that it really is true that Romney ran his campaign like a private equity fund. There were scads of highly paid consultants, limited accountability, and the client (the GOP voters) basically got fleeced while the consultants racked up big dollars. \n\nI'm actually kind of thrilled the Republican rank & file is finally learning that a) Fox News is not interested in helping them win elections, Fox is interested in telling them whatever they want to hear in order to keep the advertising dollars rolling in b) the GOP establishment is a business opportunity. They are not there to govern or legislate for The People, they are looking to make their upper end wealthy through diversion of tax and donor dollars into private accounts. As far as the GOP establishment is concerned, the US government is a business and the profits should go to the major shareholders. Failing business units should be eliminated and extraneous labor should be pink slipped. \n\nMasters like Rove have been amazing at getting them to vote against their own self interest by appealing to deep bigotry.\u00a0 The conservative media/entertainment machine has made billions of dollars off their desire to live in a reality distortion bubble. \n\nThey've been played and they finally get it.

The Republicans don't give a fuck about this country. They care about Republican power. That is all. This is scalp taking for the purpose of putting Obama in his place.

Very interesting btw, much credit is due to you Kevin for finding it.\n\nFrom the study, basically it seemed that liberals vastly overestimated their own compassion, compared to their own answers in the poll. So, my reasoning here is a variant on the \"Fox News\" response...\n\n\"Liberal\" media overstereotypes both liberals and conservatives. Since liberal media makes up the vast majority of the media in this country, most if not all people watch it and are exposed to it. Conservatives read (and understand) other sources, so it moderates the effects.\n\nThus, liberals overestimate their own compassion greatly, while underestimating conservative's compassion, because they're exposed to their own stereotype almost entirely, and they believe that's what the group is.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThis is why you're so useless. \u00a0We all know everything you'll say, and none of it is insightful, informative or correct.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIn ( our ) defense, our own blindspots are the hardest to realize.\n\nSecond. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

There are so many ways to do so, and I did provide other links to the military strategies to do so.\n\nDo you care ? \n\nApparently another difference between the two of us is that I offer what I believe are valuable to these conversations.  \n\nYou lost the point of the conversation - you did not read the link - which proves and proved your statement - again - to be false.\n\nThe US can most definitely reduce defense spending.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Also the carried interest loophole.\n\nBUT ... in accordance with Saez and Piketty's work positing 50-70% as the optimal top marginal tax rate, we should probably consider the current top level of around 40% as a massive tax break to the rich. Yes, we ought to recognize that taxes probably would be higher for the middle class in exchange for more and better quality public goods (like urban transportation systems and reliable universal health care), but the fact that raising taxes on the rich is still popular ought to be some indication that, well, actually the huge implicit social program the US government runs wherein it lets vast* classes of rich people privatize the gains and socialize the losses is actually pretty unpopular. In fact, most people would like for this program to be trimmed once and for all. Or, you know, once and again, as necessary, until they come to consensus on cutting, say, foreign aid.\n\n[*Note: not actually all that vast, but in the corporatized world where money is speech, certainly deafening.]\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNot so, Kevin: most of don't like foreign aid (I guess I'm an exception). Cutting that could solve maybe 0.001% of the problem.\u00a0 Hey it's a start!\u00a0 \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nFrankly I am amazed. I understand where we agree and at this point perhaps you and simply agree.\n\nIF you are simply pointing to educating the public about the fraud, waste and abuse.\n\n\"It is well that the people of this nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be revolution before tomorrow morning.\"\n\n-Henry Ford\n* * *\n\nI take no offense. I value your posts and was dismayed and disappointed that you said there was \"nothing defensible in that poll\". I incorrectly grouped you with those authors and posters who continue to overlook the problem and who continue to misunderstand and mischaracterize many posts that point to the continued enormity of the problem.\n\nBasic and essential economic reading often lists \"Resource Scarcity\" in the first sentences.\n\nResources are \"finite\" and I have multiple degrees in sustainable engineering planning design and execution. Our economic system ought not be designed on infinite profit for the few from finite resources when the truth is that there are more than enough resources on this planet for 6-7 billion inhabitants and there are probably an infinite number of solutions to situational scarcity.\n\nMany of those solutions would involve a complete redesign of Capitalism. See 'B' Corporations and including social and environmental investments as value inherent to our economic system.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

This is thought to be due to the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun and the inclination of the Earth\u2019s axis, tilting the Northern Hemisphere progressively towards the sun throughout March and April and increasing the amount of solar radiation received at northern latitudes.\n\nIn a new novel,\u00a0State of Euphoria, bestselling author Michael Crikey uncovers major flaws in this theory and warns against false hopes for the arrival of spring. This is not merely fiction: Crikey underpins his thesis with numerous scientific diagrams. He presents measurements from over a dozen weather stations in the Northern Hemisphere where temperatures show a cooling trend in March. \n\nHe further cites scientific results which show that in some places, snow and ice have increased in the past weeks, counter to climatologists\u2019 claims that they should be melting away in the spring sun. He further argues that even the average temperature of the Northern Hemisphere has not increased steadily; during one week of March, it showed a slight cooling despite the increase in solar radiation.\u201cThis casts a grave shadow of doubt on the theory of the seasons\u201d, says Crikey. \u201cConsensus science is not good science.\u201d \n\nHe says we should not trust computer models projecting that June will be much warmer than March in most of the Northern Hemisphere. \u201cThese models cannot even predict the weather in two weeks time \u2013 why should we believe what they say about temperatures in two months?\u201d \n\nHe also says that only six months ago, scientists were predicting a cooling.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Or Liberals entirely ignoring the Muslim menace. Or liberals over-reacting to the Muslim menace. Or the president actually being the foreign-born leader of the Muslim menace. Etc. Etc.

Many journalists know this hazard as do their editors. But space often dictates the nickle version instead of the more complete story. Short attention spans are the real problem here. If your goal is simply to be outraged about other people, Fox News fills that function quite well. On the other hand, if you're really interested in reality as opposed to a fairy tale about your own goodness, it helps to sift through the details but wonder about the omissions. That's the job of the lonely citizen/consumer. We should be proud to say we really don't know much at all.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nInteresting, but I am less interested in poor presentations, thus it is possible that I will retain more from an excellent presentation, which ...\n\n...

The broad outlines of these programs should not be secret. Their simple existence should not be secret.

Of course, keep some pertinent details obscured, so the bad guys can't develop countermeasures. But there is no need for secrecy here.

If Snowden gave details of those hacks, it could be possible to detect which routers have been compromised, secure against future intrusions, or replicate the attacks.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n>>>Maybe it's just because all this tech stuff is so beyond me, but I still fail to see that what Snowden did was so revelatory. As far as I'm concerned, he just brought public attention to what you and I and everyone else should already assume is going on.\n\nThe \"tech stuff\" is not beyond me my friend. I'm not saying I'm smarter than anyone (well, obvious Shooter/Patty caveats apply, sigh...) but I have more than a little experience in metadata design and management, data mining, search & browse technologies, etc., and from that vantage point your conclusion is, if anything, too kind. Snowden did <b>nothing</b> revelatory as the existence of these programs was at best an open secret as far back as 2006 when the NYT ran its \"Warrantless Wiretapping\" expose. That particular program was quickly shut down, but following the discussion at the time it was pretty clear the NSA was using the 1979 SCOTUS decision that metadata gathering isn't an unreasonable search to Hoover up (I still laugh at the ironic pun!) massive amounts of information.\u00a0\n\nI've taken a lot of \"friendly fire\" over this issue in this space, but will say once again: (1) there is no \"news\" in what Snowden has released given what has been covered in the press over the last 5-8 years. (2) The actual danger to civil liberties, based on what I've seen thus far, is pretty minimal as the very amount of metadata that's being gathered itself makes abuse less likely. (3) That being said, the lack of transparency by the government around these programs is disturbing and serves as fertilized potting soil for the tin-foil-hat-crowd. (4) At least so far, my conclusion remains this is just another \"throw money at anything associated with national security\" boondoggle left over from the <strike>paranoid Cheney</strike> Bush administration that Obama is too cowardly to rein in lest he be called out as \"weak on defending America.\" (Someone should ask Osama which president he found more impotent on the subject...)\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI have checked all the original sources ( Snowden and Greenwald quotes ).\n\nI never see the word 'destroy'. The strongest word I see is a phrase 'could be harmful'.\n\n* * * \n\nMany good points made in this commentary ( TLM amplified: All about $$$ ) and yet the primary attention, here, is sniping at Greenwald and Snowden.

Again, there was no news at that point to justify this imbalance; \nAgain, assuming that 4,000 of these options trades represent \"insiders\", they would \nrepresent a gain of about $4 million.\n\n- The levels of put options purchased above were more than six times higher than normal.\n\n- No similar trading \nin other airlines occurred on the Chicago exchange in the days immediately preceding Black Tuesday.\n\n-\nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., which occupied 22 floors of the World Trade Center, saw 2,157 of its \nOctober $45 put options bought in the three trading days before Black Tuesday; this compares to an average of \n27 contracts per day before September 6. Morgan Stanley's share price fell from $48.90 to $42.50 in \nthe aftermath of the attacks. Assuming that 2,000 of these options contracts were \nbought based upon knowledge of the approaching attacks, their purchasers could have profited by at least $1.2 \nmillion.\n\n- Merrill Lynch & Co., which \noccupied 22 floors of the World Trade Center, saw 12,215 October $45 put options bought in the four trading \ndays before the attacks; the previous average volume in those shares had been 252 contracts per day [a 1200% \nincrease!]. When trading resumed, Merrill's shares fell from $46.88 to $41.50; \nassuming that 11,000 option contracts were bought by \"insiders\", their profit would \nhave been about $5.5 million.\n\n\nGives you a head start - and yes - Snopes debunks the claim - yet the numbers of calls and puts and the history is open for all to read.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

For the foreseeable future, 'justice' will continue to side with business over labor.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Taken together, the massive swing seemed to indicate that Bush, not Gore, had won Florida and thus the White House.

I am a Libertarian so no mandated government healthcare is the first and best choice. Now that being said a single payer system if done right beats Obamacare hands down and beats our messed healthcare tax policy that was created in the wake of WWII and has only gotten worse. This mix of private, government, and quasi government healthcare we have is idiotic. So why am I forced to pay for my own healthcare as well as pay for medicaid, medicare, and taxes to help foot the bill for Obamacare when I get zero benefits from such system and often worse care than those on a free ride they don't pay for.  Just implement a flat tax and put everyone on the same system, at least if would be fairer than now.  So Hillary is claiming credit for the most screwed up and expensive healthcare system in the world.  Go figure.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThis article headline is horrible clickbait.  She gave her stump speech on health care to some college students.  Hail Mary my ass.

He won among those with and without college degrees. He won among gun owners and non-gun owners. He beat Mrs. Clinton among previous primary voters and those participating for the first time. And he ran ahead among both moderates and liberals.\n\nEven so, there were a few silver linings for Mrs. Clinton. While Mr. Sanders bested her among all age groups younger than 45, the two candidates polled evenly among voters aged 45 to 64. And Mrs. Clinton won the support of voters 65 and older. And, though Mrs. Clinton lost nearly every income group, she did carry voters in families earning over $200,000 per year.\n\nDavid R.

He is running the most substance-free presidential campaign in American history. Never has anyone claiming to be a candidate for President of the United States of America said so little to so many. He has issued blatant appeals to racists, bigots and xenophobes and then denied his very words on national television. His shamelessness is equally astounding and appalling.\n\nSanders promises too much out of good intentions and has had the decency to provide the semblance of a plan to back up his claims.

Neither man would have a solid base of support in Congress to pass new laws.  Neither man has demonstrated any knowledge of foreign policy or any skill at working with our allies.  Both men seem to make pie-in-the-sky promises without thinking through the details of how to make them happen.\n\nTrump and Sanders are two sides of the same coin.

The line got hearty \napplause\u2014but it also cut to the core of one of the defining lines of \nattacks against the former first lady and Democratic presidential \nfrontrunner. After nearly forty years in public life, what exactly has \nshe accomplished? \n\nIt\u2019s a question that even, at times, has tripped up Clinton herself: \nDuring her 2014 book tour, when ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer asked her about her \u201cmarquee achievement,\u201d Clinton changed the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a women\u2019s forum in Manhattan last year. I see my role as secretary\u2014in fact leadership in general in a democracy\u2014as a relay race. You run the best race you can run, you hand off the baton. Some of what hasn\u2019t been finished may go on to be finished,\u201d she told Thomas Friedman. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the [economic] stabilization and the really solid leadership that the administration provided that I think now leads us to be able to deal with problems like Ukraine because we\u2019re not so worried about a massive collapse in Europe.\u201d\n\nThe question Fiorina posed has also tripped up members of the Obama administration. When State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki was asked last year to \u201cidentify one tangible achievement\u201d accomplished through one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s key projects as Secretary of State\u2014the first-ever audit of the department\u2014Psaki punted, \u201cI am certain that those who were here at the time, who worked hard on that effort, could point out one.\u201d\n\nHillary\u2019s supporters have been stumped too.

This is dissappointment, I have a hard time removing MoJo from my feed; some self-reflection and insightful writing rather than the narcissist line \"it's you who are challenged\" and I'm glad to pay.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAs a progressive and a socialist, let me tell you a secret: NPR is not leftist.

(Do not offer them a crossover ballot if they do not ask).\"\n\nThey\u2019re not kidding. Poll worker Jeff Lewis filed a description of the training in an official declaration to a federal court:\n\nSomeone raised their hand and asked a follow-up question: \u2018So, what if someone gets a nonpartisan ballot, notices it doesn't have the presidential candidates on it, and asks you where they are?\u2019 The answer poll workers are instructed to give: \u2018Sorry, NPP ballots don't have presidential candidates on them.\u2019 That's correct: even when people ask questions of that nature, obviously intending to vote with a party.\n\nThis affidavit, and several even more horrifying, come from Election Justice USA, a non-partisan watchdog, hoping to get injunctions to stop this nonsense. [Hear my talk with the group\u2019s spokesman, Paul Thomas, on a special edition of the The Best Democracy Money Can Buy: Elections Crime Bulletin, which I host with Dennis Bernstein on the Pacifica Radio Network.]\n\nLet me throw in another complication. Nearly half of Californians \nvote by mail, ballots sent to your home automatically. Most NPP voters don\u2019t realize that, to vote in the Democratic primary today, they must bring in their NPP ballot with the envelope, and say these magic words: \u201cI want to surrender my ballot in return for a Democratic \u2018crossover\u2019 ballot.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.gregpalast.com/california-stolen-sanders-right-nowspecial-bulletin-greg-palast/#more-12053\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Here's How.\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nRepublicans HAVE nominated Donald Duck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck#Personality): \n\nDonald's two dominant personality traits are his short temper and his positive outlook on life. Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood, without a care in the world until something comes along and spoils his day. His anger is a great cause of suffering in his life. On multiple occasions, it has caused him to get in over his head and lose competitions. There are times when he fights to keep his temper in check, and he sometimes succeeds in doing so temporarily, but he always returns to his normal angry self in the end.\n\nDonald's aggressive nature has its advantages, however. While at times it is a hindrance, and even a handicap, it has also helped him in times of need...\n\nThe Duck gets a big kick out of imposing on other people or annoying them, but he immediately loses his temper when the tables are turned. In other words, he can dish it out, but he can't take it\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n<I>Trump gets smart and dials back the cretinism a bit.</i>\n\nThat sentence is doing so much heavy lifting you could use it to jack up your car.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMeasured from the base of the finger or the webbing ?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Bernie will endorse and start campaigning for Clinton next week (as will Biden).  While the platform was a good step in the right direction, it is nonbinding, and little more than a feel-good story.  Bernie can both support/campaign for Clinton AND continue to move the Democratic party back to the left.  Why is that such a bad thing?  The only people that should be bothered by that are the corporatists and Republicans (who are, in a number of ways, the same damn thing).\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYou are attempting to reframe me to meet your viewpoint. \n\nMy comment history is open.\n\nI supported Hillary and Bill and believe that the context of their words today include their entire public history.\n\nYou may choose to believe that Hillary is trustworthy. She wants you to believe that she is and she either is or is not. The polls and Hillary's behavior before and during this primary season give us evidence.\n\nMost politicians are not 'trustworthy'. Hillary ? \nI personally know Tim Kaine, since he was major or RIchmond, Va.\nWe do not agree on TPP, for instance, however, Tim tells me, consistently, his position and if he changes his stance, why.\n\nHillary operates differently than a Tim Kaine or Bernie Sanders, both of whom, I believe, possess far more integrity than Hillary Clinton.\n\n\nIntegrity, right now, on climate, energy, economic inequality and policies which have redistributed income and wealth upwards.\n\n\nIn closing, Hillary's quote: \"We will never, NEVER, see single payer.\" when we quite literally had the votes for it in 2009 is all the evidence that you should need for why Hillary is untrustworthy.\n( there are others, Obama included, who share responsibility )\n\n\nHealthcare was Hillary's original, national, issue. She sat down with Bernie came away 'distorting' what she knew to be true about Bernie to make herself appear that she is the 'progressive' on healthcare.\n\n\nThis is the uber-competitive Hillary. The 'ends' absolve the 'means'.\n\n\nThis is the win at any cost, capitalist-monopolistic, elitist greed.\n\n\nDoctors and Nurses believe in single payer.\nHillary did, once. \n\n$ Masters matter more to the Clintons than integrity.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Your opinion that he has 'no credibility' flies versus the University and panel carefully gathered and moderated for this event. Your opinion versus multiple countries and institutes of health ( including the US ). Of course there are hucksters. Of course conventional medical science can not 'prove' anything, they simply can demonstrate, over and over, that they get the same results.

When \nyears ago I found the purge of black voters as so-called felons in \nFlorida by Katherine Harris, there they marked an F next to someone\u2019s \nname if they were a so-called felon. By the way, of 58,000 names, none \nwere. None. And that changed the election of 2000. In this case, they \ndon\u2019t mark anyone as a duplicate voter. Instead, they send you a \npostcard that says, \"Please verify your address and name.\" Now, most \npeople\u2014looks like junk mail\u2014throw it away. Renters, poor people, \nstudents who are moving a lot, the letter doesn\u2019t even find them. So \nthey know who they\u2019re knocking off. If the letter doesn\u2019t come back, in a\n state like North Carolina, they\u2019re going to remove that voter. In some \nstates, it\u2019s a two-step process. If they don\u2019t vote Tuesday, they\u2019re \nmarked inactive. If they don\u2019t vote Tuesday, then they will lose their \nvote for the presidential election. And that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see\n the biggest effect of this.

Immigration spending is foreign aid, since it's spent to aid in getting foreign people back home.  And since making our world secure is foreign aid, Social Security should probably count as foreign aid too, since that's all about security -- it's even in the name.

Without civilization, we had resource conflicts that led to war and instability - to fix it, we gave individuals power to decide how those resources were used, and guards to enforce those rules, but they had no legal obligation to anyone but themselves.
