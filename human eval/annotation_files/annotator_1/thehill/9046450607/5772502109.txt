  I'm trying to imagine one of the current crop of Senators and Congresscritters standing up like this, and I...can't.

    While I certainly don't wish any harm to Zelenskyy, Putin now needs to be very careful with him.

Imagine if (Gods forbid) Zelenskyy died fighting Russia? Instant martyr.

      <b>Laura Ingraham Was Forced To Educate The Self-Proclaimed Very Stable Genius About Putin's War</b><blockquote>-- Trump ignorantly said US troops were deploying in Ukraine.
-- "You told me about the amphibious attack by Americans. You shouldn't be saying that," Trump said.
-- Fox News host Laura Ingraham replied, "No, those are the Russians."</blockquote>"You know what's also very dangerous is you told me about the amphibious attack by Americans," Trump mistakenly said on The Ingraham Angle. "You shouldn't be saying that, because you and everybody else shouldn't know about," Trump continued. "They should do that secretly, not be doing that through the great Laura Ingraham."

"No, those are the Russians," Ingraham replied.

"Oh, I thought you said that we were sending people in," Trump said. "That'll be next."

        This has been a true lesson in global leadership by Biden, proving once again that the U.S. relationship with the rest of the free world matters. All the work Biden has put in to repair the damage Trump and the Republicans did to our global alliances is paying off.

          Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine is part of a broader test: whether the global erosion of democracy will continue unchecked. Trump did Putin's bidding, culminating in the 'Big Lie" and the seditious insurrection on January 6th. Trump is as complicit in the slaughter of women and children in Ukraine as in the cop-killing on January 6th.

            Trillions of dollars floating in the offshore dark money-markets from Putin and his cronies raiding the Russian till. As long as that world remains unchecked there will always be Putin's and Trump's attempting to destroy and corrupt democracy. We see it in the U.S. with almost the entire Republican party every time Biden threatens to plug tax loopholes the elite controlled media attack his presidency.

                  Meanwhile, Putin is killing children while Trump praises him as a genius.

How much Russian oil is imported by the US, Comrade Headstone?

Oh, by the way, I see you upvoted yourself.  Is it because you are an American traitor, or because you are insecure?  I bet you suck your thumb at night.  ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
