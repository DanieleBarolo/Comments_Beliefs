So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.

PARENT COMMENT:
There are some protections that are valuable in the law but much of it is written in a manor that does not match the real world.


An example is catastrophic insurance is offered to people under the age of 30 while it is not offered to people at age 60.  Most people under age 30 have far less ability to pay the cost of health care when they have a catastrophic policy.


The people that actually have the financial position to carry catastrophic insurance policies are the higher income people which tend to be the older people not the people under age 30.

What's funny is right winger trolls don't understand the ACA .Or more importantly ,why they hate it.
But blog subjects rarely matter.Only a horse tranquilizer will do the trick.

  I fully understand much more of ACA than many people.  It has both good and bad aspects just as almost any law does.


What we have in most of these chats is as follows:


The "Republicans" are fighting against the "evil" of the ACA.  The Democrats are fighting for the "good" of the ACA.


The truth is that a very large amount of time is spent calling people names from both sides.


It would be nice to remove the political affiliations and discuss the social and economic implications of what is happening with a realization that there is both good and bad aspects of every law.
