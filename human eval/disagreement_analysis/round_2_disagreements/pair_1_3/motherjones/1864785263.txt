For the FOX too lazy to read: Highlights in Bill's words, all on tape, or written by him.

'I've covered wars, okay? I've been there. The Falklands, Northern Ireland, the Middle East. I've almost been killed three times, okay.'" - to Tucker Carlson

In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O'Reilly noted, 

"Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash."

In 2008, he took a shot at journalist Bill Moyers, saying, 

"I missed Moyers in the war zones of [the] Falkland conflict in Argentina, 
the Middle East, and Northern Ireland. I looked for Bill, but I didn't 
see him."

*
O'Reilly was never in a combat situation, or war zone, let alone nearly surviving, or almost being killed 3x ... FOX viewers are all caught in a 'prevarication zone'.

One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .
