One only hopes voters punish the GOP in the next several elections.

Republicans just doomed themselves to Benghazi on steroids from the Dems. 

This is going to be fun

PARENT COMMENT:
In 2022 alone, Biden's budget projects a $1.8 trillion deficit, half of the record $3.6 trillion deficit expected for this year. In the following years, that would fall to a range of $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion, higher than all but a few years following the Great Recession.

By 2024, the debt will have reached $35 trillion in no additional monies are spent.   Telling a dem that they can't spend any more money than last year is like telling a two year old that you can't crap in your own pants anymore.
