Your bloomberg article makes one MAJOR fudge in the numbers though.

"Expenses for some policies can reach $6,350 for a single
person and $12,700 per family, the most allowed by the health-care law, according to a survey by HealthPocket Inc. of seven
states, including California and Ohio. That’s 26 percent higher
than the average deductible in the seven states, and a scenario
likely repeated across the country, said Kev Coleman, head of
research and data at Sunnyvale, California-based HealthPocket."


Comparing the $6,350 number to a deductible is a horrible analogy.  Once the deductible is paid, the person will still be responsible for their percentage of coverage, and only the most expensive health plans available will pay 100%.  However, the $6,350 number is the maximum out-of-pocket a expense a person will pay for the entire year for many bronze plans and virtually all of the silver plans I have looked at.  If a person has a $1500 deductible, and 50% coverage after and they come back with a $100,000 bill, they will be responsible for the first $1500, then another $49,750 for their part of the coverage.  And I don't recall ever really seeing many insurance plans prior to Obamacare offering maximum out-of-pocket expenses even remotely close to $6,350 a year, if they had a maximum at all, at least when looking at plans comparable to the bronze plans that are at issue here.



Also, $10,000 to $20,000 deductibles were common in the individual market.  And I have read plenty of analyses that have shown that deductibles have been rising for years.  In fact, since 2010, the increases in deductibles appear to have been mitigated somewhat by Obamacare, since they have risen more slowly than similar previous multi-year analyses.

So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.

PARENT COMMENT:
Jason, did you read the Bloomberg article?  That was just a list of facts, not anecdotes.


Again, some people will unquestionably be helped, but there will be far more harmed by this.


This is a little off topic, but it is a very important issue;  Have you ever thought about what the effect of increasing interest rates will have on government social programs?  We have 250 year low interest rates and the biggest debt in human history, most of which matures in less than 4 years.

OK let's see if we can figure this one out - the economy is doing well especially for corporations, basically all good companies are doing well as they ever have in recent decades, and workers are starting to get wage raises plus should be able to get raise in minimum wage one of these days if GOP ever values those workers.  So why is anyone trying to shut down ACA if it is not hurting the economy or companies and only helping people and also controlling costs of medical bills better meaning improved medical industry efficiency?  Last I heard from political folks that do not want to destroy ACA, the only changes that are needed are minor editorial changes to some text which happens in all big bills through history that have been passed.  So GOP wants to use non-routine procedures for good passed bills to destroy this one?  Let's just say it if that is correct, the GOP hate all on earth except their own greasy asses.

  It's NOT "only helping people".  People are avoiding hospitals because of the insane deductibles.  Mass and Hawaii, the two states w/ mandatory insurance, have been having doctor shortages for years now. It's starting to happen in Fla.

This will be nationwide.  Government installed price controls almost always lead to shortages.

Have you ever looked up the "McCarran–Ferguson Act"?


It was installed because the insurance company's prices were TOO LOW.  There were no doctor shortages at the time and no out of control costs, but government decided they would "help".

    My individual-insurance deductible and out-of-pocket were far more "insane" before Obamacare.  My new no-subsidy premium is a bit more expensive, but the plan is <strong>hugely</strong> superior.  If you want details, let me know.  Most people who use your argument have employer plans or Medicare, and have no idea what individual insurance health plans were like before Obamacare.

I understand  cost shifting.  I understand it is a very real thing and will lead to nationwide shortages.  Just like Mass and Hawaii have been experiencing for years now. 

All of the numbers put out by government and cronies only look at one side of the ledger.  They talk about the people "helped", while completely ignoring the people harmed.  It is done on purpose and is fraudulent.  Liberals would be apoplectic if the CEO of Walmart used the same "math" in order to entice higher priced shares.



I will never understand why so many people believe that the biggest debtor in human history, the US federal government, can "invest" wisely.

        Anecdotes.  I can give you plenty of anecdotes myself, too -- positive ones.  From my own experience, those of acquaintances, and news articles (which are always easy to pick and choose).  (And yes, I know one person who is understandably pissed about how much his deductible went up.  Things do vary a lot by geography.)

My pre-Obamacare United Healthcare (American Medical Security) Policy:
$400/year (non-smoker) when I (happily) cancelled it.  $10,000 deductible, 50% copay for the next $8000 (so $14000 out-of-pocket max).  NOTHING paid before deductible.  NO drug coverage -- and they refused to let me add it at ANY cost.  No free preventative.

My Obamacare policy:  $525/month without subsidy.  $6300/month deductible and out-of-pocket.  Drug Coverage included, BEFORE deductible, with reasonable copays (including $0 for generics).  Doctor visits, including specialist, BEFORE deductible, with reasonable copays.  Free preventative (as ALL Obamacare plans include), such as annual physical (including doctor and labs) and screening colonoscopy).  My screening colonoscopy under my pre-Obamacare plan cost me over $2400, even after the network provider discount (which was the only real benefit of the plan, since I ended up paying EVERYTHING out-of-pocket).  But the screening Colonoscopy I got on my Obamacare plan cost -- ZERO.  Except for premium, ALL costs (including copays) count toward the out-of-pocket max, unlike pre-Obamacare plans.

And people below certain threshold levels can get the Silver plan I have with subsidies (of course), but also with cost-sharing reductions that lower the deductible and out-of-pocket to as low as $500 each (no, there is NOT a zero missing there).
