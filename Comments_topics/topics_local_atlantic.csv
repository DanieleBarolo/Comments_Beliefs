good point but from my vantage point as a former math professor poor high school education is another of the unfortunate outcomes of the free ride that higher ed gets here is the short story universities get grants to produce phd's in areas of national need like math with no real accountability they generate phd's that sometimes have trouble solving harder calculus problems these students get jobs at colleges that produce some of our high school teachers as professors these people are not going to challenge their students its too risky furthermore why try to teach something innately difficult when in this era of student consumerism happy students are what is important to administrators so we get unprepared high school teachers then high school gets dumbed down now you need a college degree to get a high school education and a high school job obviously this isn't true of all high schools or individuals but it is true too often if you want to read more about this go to my blog inside higher ed com go to the category university education dumbs down high school"", ""i am former college professor who has spent almost a lifetime observing how much of higher education is essentially a scam on students and their parents i feel compelled to correct some of this article's statements they can be used by unscrupulous institutions to justify some of their behavior i am sure the statements are not intentional they may only be a reflection of what has been happening as students graduate without a good education but with the belief purposely instilled by their institutons marketing department that they do have a good eduation i hope what i write here will help both readers and the author who overall does a great job of bringing important facts to our attention let's start with the statement in that it is not really true that a college degree is the new high school degree jordan is telling us that it isn't true because it is not yet the norm what i mean when i say a college degree is the new high school degree is that the new college education is equal to the old high school degree if that is not true it is not because things are getting better it's because they are getting worse anyway saying this in the sense of one now needs a college degree is correct only because of the dumbing down of both a high school education and a college education and that adds to the coffers of colleges and finanially encourages them to hope for a poor high school education i have even heard that expressed by professors in jordan says college is hard basing his conclusion on the fact that many don't finish if college is so hard why is it so much less work in academically adrift the authors report that students study about half as much as they did years ago i could go on but i will finish with this plea please don't accept any priesthood at their word and please don't confuse degree with education once the public realizes that college professors and administrators can be just as bad as the rest of us including bankers they will demand more transparency about college claims i am trying to help with posts like this one and with my blog inside higher ed com and jordan please keep the good information flowing thanks""]"

believe the racist accusation is used way too often and the meaning has become watered down because of that real cases of racism gets lost in the mix one time i was with a half a dozen th graders who happened to be white and they were looking at a bunch of kids playing in a park and talking about the game they were playing they were making innocent observations and one kid referenced the black kid and another kid said that s racist kids are being raised that they cannot even describe people without it being called racist facts or statements that are backed up with statistical data that may

filthy racist white piece of s one girl was pinned up against the wall by protesters who shouted filthy white b in her face there are many more examples like this i personally have witnessed such behavior recently at a college attending a political event you said but i don't think the percentage of white hating blacks is as high as black hating whites that is a huge leap with absolutely no data to support it while you may think that is true in your circles the cases of black on white violence versus white on black violence suggests otherwise according to the doj during the period blacks committed an average of violent crimes against whites whereas whites committed such crimes against blacks this means blacks were the attackers in of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites this figure is consistent with reports from the last year doj released similar statistics of all the white people i know personally i know very few who i would say really dislike black people just because they are black and of those few people most don t hold anything against blacks who work and take care of their family etc i will say though that i do hear a lot of people who are tired of being

russian problem two of them wrote this article"", ""the nine lessons of russian propaganda rely on dissenting political groups in western countries for dissemination kremlin talking points appear with uncanny similarity in most alternative political movements in the west including communist libertarian nationalist and even environmentalist whose protests occasionally overlap with anti nato protests i had an especially close look at the libertarian community as i have long been a part of it rampant misinformation led me to write these three increasingly horrified essays about what some prominent libertarians were saying about russia and ukraine putin's libertarians when your former libertarian hero calls you a nazi and the latest libertarian shillery for russia radical kremlin ideologue alexander dugin articulates this strategy fairly explicitly the most important factor should not be whether these groups are pro russian or not what they oppose is of much greater importance here the enemy of my enemy is my friend it is simple and easy to understand if we adopt such an attitude in order to appeal to all possible allies who either approve of us or who do not more and more people will follow suit if only due to pragmatism in doing so we will create a real functioning network a kind of global revolutionary alliance domestic propaganda is most important marquis de custine a french travel writer wrote in his book the political regime here would not survive years of free communication with western europe the long term viability of russian autocracy is more threatened by the standard of living in finland estonia lithuania and poland than by any foreign military this fear of facing their own poverty and oppression also echoes throughout the troubled history of russia's relations with ukraine this is why the kremlin so frantically saturates the russian public with paranoia and a siege mentality their society does not compare favorably to that of their neighbors the kremlin's sway over russian public opinion cannot be underestimated i know more than one ukrainian who received a phone call from relatives in russia after the maidan revolution to confirm stories about people murdered in the streets of kyiv or lviv for speaking russian and to urge them to escape no such thing ever took place russian was and is spoken every day the term zombified as entered the ukrainian lexicon to describe acquaintances under the sway of russian propaganda russian media diligently puts the world in context for the russian public it would be unconscionable to allow russians to believe ukraine's revolution was a populist uprising against corruption and absolutism it needed re branding not a revolution but a coup not driven by a desire for rule of law but by a hatred of russians not ukrainian but cia jewish nazis the broad range of villains in their contradictory narratives reflects the range of ideologies to which they attempt to appeal amazingly they have some success the american diplomat's handing out of cookies and ambassador nuland's off hand insult of the eu were the grains of truth upon which the russian propaganda machine built monstrous menacing narratives of american and or nazi conspiracy destroy and ridicule the idea of truth many people including peruvian statesman and nobel prize winning author mario vargo llosa have observed that russian propaganda destroys meaning they pursue several tactics including the false moral equivalences of whataboutism polluting the information space more below and hosting seemingly objective discussions that give equal play to the truth alongside the most ludicrous distortions making the truth seem like the least interesting of many possible narratives for example just days after signing a ceasefire in syria the russian military bombed at least five medical facilities in syria while doing so their ministry of foreign affairs tweeted about humanitarian aid shipments regarding the budapest memorandum russia's foreign minister sergey lavrov said we have not violated it it contains only one obligation i e not to use nuclear weapons against ukraine this is outrageously untrue and cannot be an accident there is a russian expression intelligently you cannot understand russia which comes from a year old quatrain by russian poet fyodor tyutchev the poem concludes in russia you can only believe the bias against comprehension is deep seeded putin is strong russia is strong this message permeates all russian information efforts power is the perception of power and the kremlin understands this very well they constantly allude to or directly threaten invasion and nuclear war with everyone from their neighbors to turkey to the united states it is impossible for serious western journalists to ignore such threats so the kremlin gets a message inserted into foreign societies exciting those voices who seek to avoid conflict while maintaining a degree of separation from the messenger the kremlin needs to distract its public from the needless economic hardship and rampant corruption when faced with sanctions russia could not allow itself to be seen as the victim they immediately issued counter sanctions and flooded both the news and comment sections with stories of how polish apple growers and other european producers were suffering without the russian market sanctions are bombastically announced and quietly done away with as is usually the case headlines were more important than reality headlines are more important than reality especially while first impressions are forming first impressions are known to be extremely sticky they persist even after subsequent evidence is conclusive consequently russian propaganda seems to fight hard for the first impression and then relent when opposition politician boris nemtsov was assassinated they quickly spun several elaborate theories which played on russian news their propaganda about neo nazis dominated coverage of ukraine's revolution even after multiple statements and an open letter from the leaders of ukraine's jewish community in support of the nazi narrative russian state television even reported fake results of ukraine's election stating that now president poroshenko lost the race to right sector leader dmytro yarosh in reality yarosh received about of the vote obviously anybody paying attention would find out this was nonsense within days if not hours but being proved wrong does not seem to matter to them no matter audacious russian lies delivered from semi official sources succeed in muddying the waters and preventing the formation of clear impressions that recognize the reality of what is happening demoralize during both the war with georgia and the present invasion of ukraine russian propaganda very effectively showed pictures of dead dying and tortured georgian and ukrainian soldiers they were on the news and all over the internet this strategy extends to western society and is discussed explicitly in the active measures interviews of former kgb agents there seem to be seem to be libertarian organizations only interested in libertarianism when it intersects with anti americanism it is easy to imagine why magnify western corruption and weakness is in russia's interest move the conversation no matter how ridiculous their propaganda no matter how many times it is proven to be false it succeeds in shifting the conversation western journalists were consumed with determined if russia was invading ukraine that they had little space left to examine how russia was invading the propaganda dominated the conversation at the expense of the actual invasion the exploitable bias of western journalists is that each side has its perspective and the truth is somewhere in the middle pollute the information space one of the strangest examples of russian disinformation is the columbia chemicals plant explosion hoax in which it seems that either the kremlin or a close ally orchestration a chorus of reports about an unfolding terrorist attack in the united states that never actually happened politician alexei navalny said about the polluting strategy in russia the paid trolls have made it impossible for the normal internet user to separate truth from fiction the point is to spoil it to create the atmosphere of hate to make it so stinky that normal people won t want to touch it you have to remember the internet population of russia is just over percent the rest are yet to join and when they join it s very important what is their first impression domestically they want to ruin the one media which they don't control internationally they want to sow confusion and paranoia gas lighting accuse the enemy of doing what you are doing to confuse the conversation after american generals began using the term hybrid war to describe russia's planned deliberate scaling of hostilities from pseudo civilian protests to military formations a russian general without irony accused the united states of hybrid war against russia while russian proxies were burning ukrainian books and flags destroying monuments to ukraine's great famine the holodomor crimea tartar cultural centers and everything else that wasn't strictly russian they were accusing ukrainians of hostility toward russian culture even though nothing of the kind had taken place the accounts russians who struggled on maidan alongside ukrainians were ignored it was ukraine's leadership who eventually had to give reassurances on the international stage that the rights of minorities would be respected not russia's and not the leaders of their proxies despite harsh crackdowns on ukrainian culture tartar institutions catholic and protestant churches and everything else that wasn't russian"", 'but russia']"

about isis which is only a small part of the complicated and failed syrian civil war and far from aleppo assad and russia actually want isis to remain intact while they destroy the non islamist opponents of assad to delegitimize assad's opposition in western eyes its a macabre and baffling strategy on putin's part but assad gets to be king of the rubble pile until the next civil war assuming

repression and corruption did you know assad was allowing elements of the former saddam regime people who later helped build isis into a organized killing machine stage attacks on us troops in iraq from eastern syria there is evidence linking officials from assad's government with blessing from assad himself whether the civil war started spontaneously most likely given the upheaval in the arab world at the time or from us interference the us had a legitimate grievance against assad by technicality the us could argue that assad's plots with future isis fighters against the us constituted

have been able to put the rebellion down inside of six months with minimal loss of life instead we now have hundreds of thousands dead millions of refugees and every stripe of crazy murderous genocidal thug maniac running around in syria totally destroying that country and yet assad remains it looks like the syrian people have paid a high price for us foreign policy and haven't gotten much to show for it i do not defend assad i merely look at reality the us and it's allies in the region wanted to remove assad but they could not directly invade and depose him they did not have a good enough reason but then there was this rebellion me personally i think the us and others fomented this rebellion as you gave them kudos for doing but even if they didn't doesn't matter they jumped on this opportunity when it arose and they used this minor internal rebellion as a pretext to flood syria with mercenaries and weapons and money and we destroyed that country is assad a bad guy yes should he be removed ideally yes but now is what is happening in syria today an acceptable price to pay to remove assad hardly in my view and would the situation in syria today have gotten this bad without the influence of outside forces including the us who acted upon a desire to remove assad my contention is that no it would not have gotten this bad without the us and other actors intervening and exacerbating the situation to further their own interests and in this context i think russia is the more positive influence on the situation you look at the wmd situation it was russia who brokered the deal to get those weapons out of syria and now you look at this situation where after months of bombing the us coalition has withered away and shown little progress and now russia rolls in there and inside of two months time we are talking the state department is talking about the transition to a post assad regime turkey got so mad at russia for spoiling it's fun that it shot down a russian aircraft and killed it's pilot and yet russia did not respond militarily but it doubled down on it's support for assad and it's assault against the rebels now the us media is upset about this because some of those rebels are our rebels or so we're told and that's all this is the us wants to control the next government in syria just as turkey and saudi arabia do but russia has moved in to maintain the status quo and i think that's right look at the tactics of the west how they have brought on all these mercenaries and caused all this death and destruction obviously things were better under assad if not ideal and while hopefully things will improve for the syrian people i honestly don't see the us or turkey providing that sunny day for them honestly it looks more like russia is the

way it is and what happened after hitler invaded poland red army ended up storming berlin well current red army is already in moscow no need to storm anything"", ""just a little bit of history ukraine as a state was created after the russian revolution the same way was created other states so called former soviet republics so all these nations should be thankful to bolsheviks for their existence the reason the states and smaller republic within the russian federation were created because bolsheviks communists believed in self determination of nations czar's russia did not have any national republics but provinces similar to the states in us which were governed from the center back to ukraine as i mentioned ukraine never existed as a state its current territory has been under the influence of different empires from ottoman lithuania to austria hungary and russia crimea has been russian for more then years since was taken from ancestors of ottoman empire the western part of ukraine became a part ukraine after stalin and hitler divided poland note that the western ukraine is catholic like poles and most of the east are orthodox like russians this divide is important because for example poles despite being a linguistically slavic nation has almost sided with enemies of russia crimea was given to ukraine without asking people of crimea and during the soviet union period it did not matter much because people in general may have lived at any place no borders the same laws but of course some cultural differences different languages and traditions millions of russians lived in ukraine and millions of ukrainians lived in russian and other republics it was a mix after the fall of the soviet union the nationalistic tendencies prevailed local elites wanted power and money they played the nationalistic card and blamed russia for everything but in all former soviet republics including russia the result was the same impoverished masses and few national oligarchs and member of elites free market in its purest over the last years all these republics went in different directions now back to ukraine over the last years years ukraine experienced two or three colorful revolution but the prosperity never came the latest revolution was a desperate protest against corruption and economic hardship if some think it was about freedom s they are mistaken economically ukraine is tied up to russia like canada to us yanukovich started negotiation with the west in a hope to buy a prosperity he requested bln and was offered ml of so called help from eu plus austerity for already impoverished population and association with nato in the last moment he realized that it was not going to work but he could not or did not want to to explain it properly to ukrainians eventually he ran out of the country and a new government was installed by the west despite the transition agreement that has been signed by all parties by the way if yanucovich did not flee and stayed be killed or put in prison by maidan would the west have supported him because he is legitimately elected president or they would not care about this fact did putin like yanocivich no it is not in russian interest to have a failed state on its borders i don't think that us would be happy if similar happens in mexico or canada i believe that the main reason putin pacified crimea is to prevent a civil war in ukraine russia does not want to have a second yugoslavia on its borders if crimea did not peacefully and without a person killed join russia the war would have started and russia definitively does not need a war but some parties don t care or even would encourage it guess who ps unconfirmed rumors when the stock market collapsed because of the ukraine concerns the russian government controlled entities bought shares of many energy companies buy on dip and don't allow crises to waste about the referendum people can argue to death whether it is legal prepared etc

action is because they have to there is no other way to achieve a diverse class while maintaining high academic admission standards because that the proportion of black applicants with test scores high enough to gain admission to selective colleges without affirmative action is much lower than it should be and affirmative action is the least disastrous solution to the problem when texas republicans banned affirmative action democrats responded by passing a law forcing texas universities including flagship ut austin to offer automatic admission to any texas applicant who graduated in the top of their high school class since many schools have almost entirely black student bodies this law assured that minorities would be admitted to texas universities despite the affirmative action ban but it also wrecked admissions standards grades and class rank are difficult to directly compare from school to school because some schools have much higher achieving student bodies than others and some schools have more academically rigorous curricula that's why standardized tests exist they provide a benchmark that can be used to compare students from different schools when transcripts and class ranks can't really provide an apples to apples comparison the university of texas had to dramatically increase the number of remedial courses for students who gained admission through the law while high scoring students who had impressive grades and scores but weren't in the top at their competitive high schools were denied admission in favor of much lower scoring ten percenters from low achieving schools before the ten percent law texas was a leading public university but its student quality now trails many other public flagships and the school's institutional prestige has suffered as a result when california banned affirmative action meanwhile the percentage of black students at its top universities plunged ucla's undergraduate student body is black and only of berkeley freshmen are black better college counseling and outreach to talented students in disadvantaged schools is a great way to help individual students but if you believe that it's important that competitive universities serve a meaningful number of minority students then these programs are not enough"", ""i think the best way to answer the question of why do we care that asian kids find it harder to get into colleges than white kids is that it does apply to black hispanic kids as well in the sense that it gives you a vision of what a future in which the academic achievements of black hispanic students reach approximate parity with white students looks like the attitude that asians must face in this country is very often this far you shall rise and no farther know your place we call it the bamboo ceiling and it starts with college admissions we are told that we have enough so we must accept lower results for the same level of accomplishment and work our middle class children work harder and harder each year to fight for a narrower and narrower opening into the middle class while students from more disadvantaged families are completely screwed if black students were to become competitive enough and this doesn't have to be all black students just a large enough subset do you think colleges would be willing to have their campus be over black of course not black students would then suffer the same kind of limits that asian students do now and the standards for admission for them would rise in the same way high educational attainment doesn't mean that asians aren't being disadvantaged nor is it just to allow them to be disadvantaged relative to whites when historically it's asians who have suffered persecution as for the essays point i don't think it's necessary to prohibit mention of race in applications every asian student already knows not to draw attention to their asian ness on college applications and it would still be better than what we have now what modifications would you make to the idea or do you have another idea to help with this issue"", ""i went to school back in the s and s so i'm sure things are a lot different now my school was predominantly white we had a significant number of black students and some asians almost all of the teachers were white this article talks about things from the perspective of the black teacher but i'd be interested to hear more about how different students view black teachers at my school the white kids felt like the black teachers held the black students to a different standard for example if a black student was being disruptive in class or was caught swearing the white kids would claim the black teacher would be more forgiving than if a white student had done the same thing i also think there was a certain resentment on the part of the white students that a black teacher was being brought in at all they felt it was done just to accommodate the black students the asian students in particular would then feel like black students were getting special treatment if the school is bringing in a black teacher to make the black students happy then why aren't there asian teachers for asian kids again maybe things are different now but back then there was a lot of tension over perceived special treatment personally i never worried too much about whether i had a lot in common with my teacher race gender etc weren't things that entered my mind when i evaluated whether i had the right teacher before me diversity is a good thing and kids should certainly learn to interact with people who are different including their teachers but the goal shouldn't be to make sure black students get black teachers latino students get latino teachers and so on the goal should be to show students that your teacher can be black female or gay and be just or bad or overworked as any white teacher""]"

public school students need to be taught the english language and the rest of american students need to be taught spanish or as our previous president would say 'mexican' scientists have begun to show that the advantages of bilingualism are even more fundamental than being able to converse with a wider range of people being bilingual actually makes you smarter it can have a profound effect on your brain improving cognitive skills not related to language and even shielding against dementia in old age studies of the brain have shown that people who are fluent in two languages will keep both language systems active even if they are not directly engaged in translating between the two alarmingly scientists discovered this creates a sort of interference when one system obstructs the other the good news is that this forces the brain to overcome the obstruction giving the brain a cognitive workout that actually helps make the bilingual person smarter or at least better at solving certain types of puzzles in the laboratory one of the great difficulties in learning a language that is only accessible in the classroom is that real language acquisition requires immersion middlebury college has a famous summer immersion program where you can be expelled if you say a word of english the military has similarly strict rules at its language schools these programs have shown that it is possible to take a person from total ignorance to basic fluency in only two months by way of example i had a friend who had gotten her bachelor's in french at an american university and who overhearing a conversation between two french speakers at an airport realized she had no idea what they were saying the problem with classroom language instruction is that students are only given an hour to practice and even that practice is not immersive anyone who wants to learn spanish should plan a minimum month long vacation in some spanish speaking country and attend one of the many inexpensive spanish schools available from day one these schools do not translate for students often instructors will not even speak english and if they do they'll refuse to use it it sounds counter intuitive but the success of this method speaks for itself these lessons should also be applied toward teaching english to native speakers of spanish or any other language one or two hours a day is not enough and never will be hours a day might be the bare minimum required but total immersion will yield the best results edit wow i inadvertently touched an exposed nerve with some folks i'm just going to paste my reply to one of my detractors below because i don't see the need to reword it my statement that we should all learn spanish was not really serious i chose spanish because it allowed me to flip the argument of the article my more serious point is that we should all learn some other language for americans spanish seems the most valuable due to our geographic proximity to so many spanish speaking countries not to mention the opportunity to communicate with spanish speakers already living here also to all those who became unhinged i suggest a bit of historical perspective i give you the words of an elderly former president ulysses s grant reflecting on his experiences as second lieutenant grant at the start of the mexican war for myself i was bitterly opposed to the measure and to this day regard the war with mexico which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation it was an instance of a republic following the bad example of european monarchies in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory so consider that this unjust war is how our country acquired the states of california utah nevada and large swaths of arizona new mexico colorado and wyoming ask yourself whether you like that these places are within our nation's borders i for one am happy with how it turned out for us but i'm not willing to be so ungracious as to despise our neighbors to the south from whom we took these lands at gunpoint"", 'i can tell you from experience both as a science teacher and a spanish teacher to beginners and also to heritage speakers that students whose parents are native spanish speakers do better in school when their parents speak spanish at home and read to them in spanish as well my bilingual students whose parents try to speak in english as a second language and raise their children solely in english do not do as well the reason research shows us is that when you are speaking in a second language as a non native speaker it is harder to express advanced adult ideas and that is what children need as a model for language in the home that their parents can express themselves as an adult lest you think this is just one anecdote of my students come from spanish language households over years of teaching that is about students out of total as for war refugees that is a different story i think there is a lot more going on there besides just language acquisition and cultural loss there is trauma and grief and severe disruption', 'the world would be better off with one

coverage about what is happening in egypt is a joke filled with distortions are one sided or are even completely fabricated just for the sake of slander here i am an egyptian who lives in egypt and actualy knows what is happening our president abdel fattah el sisi was democratically elected he is loved by the people we fully support our military security and police forces and our intelligence service and we are forever thankful to them for risking their lives on a daily basis to protect us and our country from terrorists who wanted to do to egypt what they did to iraq syria and libya egypt is not turning into military dictatorship all this slander is because we thwarted the u s imperial agenda in egypt no wonder the u s mainstream media is bashing afterall we overthrew their puppets and elected a president who will help egypt stand on its own two feet something the u s israel want to prevent at all cost how come the media has nothing to say about the many projects egypt is working on such as the building of proper housing for the poor the many projects of the suez canal that is generating great revenue for egypt many people's pension has increased dramatically the steps taken to facilitate the lives for farmers who are the backbone of egypt's economy e g decreasing the costs for renting land in order to encourage farming the reconstructions of roads and bridges although it is a short terms solution to the traffic problem it is already an accomplishment of the government with an immediate tangible result already fixing some the traffic problems egypt is facing the reformation of the education system the restoration of the historical buildings these are just some of the very few projects egypt is working on and that never ever gets covered in u s uk mainstream media all they do is slander us and our country no meaningful and in depths analysis about what is truly happening here the media loves portraying our authorities as a bunch of barbarians worse than the mb and hitler himself which is not true surely like in any countries mistake happen and there are few fishy individuals but overall egypt is doing it right our authorites are doing a very good job egypt is not cracking down on those who oppose the government nor is egypt becoming more repressive the journalists who live here and whose articles get published slandering our government yet claim egypt is cracking down on those who criticize the government are obviously contradicting their own statement egypt is cracking down terrorists criminals and on all those who try to do to egypt what they did to iraq and syria it is a fact that we are going through war like times the u s qatar and turkey are trying to do to egypt what they did to iraq syria and libya turkey had to give up hope of ever joining the eu erdogan was promised and hoping to become the leader of the new world order the new ottoman like empire qatar a tiny oil rich country does whatever the u s tells them to qatar even built al udeid the u s military base in qatar for the u s which says a lot about the u s qatari relationship qatar has spent a lot of money to destabilize egypt so we have every right to arrest those who are a threat to our national security and all those who refuse to follow the law and respect the judiciary and this is how it should be also many of the so called human organizations are used for political purposes and they use human rights as a pretext to justify interference some of these human rights organizations for instance wanted to pressure us to release mb members from prison hrw criticized egypt for listing the muslim brotherhood as a terrorist group although by this time the mb had already torched over churches adn coptic institutions hrw also falsely accused egypt of a massacre in rabaa adaweya when it was the mb who piled weapons in their tents and started shooting at the police the fist ones to die were policemen although hrw have been informed several times they intentionally left out this information hrw also lied and falsely accused assad's gov of using chemical weapons when it was al qaeda who used those weapons against civilians to give the u s the excuse for a direct and very open military intervention because assad was about to win the war against the u s armed and trained terrorists"", ""it was not a military coup it was the biggest protests in egypt's history it was the will of the masses that led to actions started by a group of civilians called tamarod who created a petition which was signed by million egyptians calling for the ouster of morsi which then led to the biggest protest ever which led to removal of morsi the military's role was the role of the protector also keep in mind that the mb had a militia and were in the process of further developing it and creating their own proper army besides the national egyptian army what does this say about the mb the media is lying again and they use the exact same lying propaganda the muslim brotherhood use calling the ouster of morsi a military coup which is not true our military protected egypt and prevented it from turning into iraq and syria"", ""my dear fool your entire body is what represents what's messed up with egypt i knoew much more about egypt than you do it clearly appears egypt was already a shithole before morsi assumed power you muppet this 'destruction' you speak off was nothing more than an illusion that didn't even effect you and the 'liberal elite' of egypt why is it wrong for morsi to gain control over state institutions he's the bloody president you moron if he didn't gain control then what's the point of elections never before have i heard such garbage that's why morsi issued a supra constitutional declaration giving himself unchecked powers never before seen in egypt allah akbar the ignorance and stupidity in this comment will bewilder anyone obviously you've never seem to have heard of a man called hosni mubarak a man who spent years in power who changed the constitution several times to suit his needs morsi gave himself powers just so he can pass through a referendum you seem to completely forget he asked the people to vote to approve or disapprove of the constitution did it escape your mind he didn't simply pass through it stubbornly he wanted a vote on it the constitutional court which has allowed mubarak to rape egypt and continue to rule without question for years kept blocking morsi's attempts at going ahead with a referendum as soon as the referendum was over he removed his extraordinary powers right after the unchecked power you are so keen to talk about was gone just like that you seem to completely forget about that too no doubt like other indoctrinated egyptians you let the facts pass through one ear and out the other that's why they issued cease and desist orders to all private tv stations before the coup that's rubbish show me the letters right now that morsi sent to the tv stations asking to c d i want to see the genuine articles more propaganda by the pro coup camp and let me ask you did these tv stations close no but after the coup dozens of mb channels were forcibly closed down no c d letter and look at bassem youssef after one episode making fun of sissi candy his show is now suspended that's why they tried to arbitrarily lower the retirement ages for judges to to remove all current judges you seem to be very ignorant don't you already know that a lot of these judge positions are hereditary they pass the jobs to their sons and their sons morsi lowered the retirement age to prevent this not to mention he was targetting the constitutional court made of corrupt mubarak era judges who were happy with years of dictatorship that's why they arbitrary replaced the prosecutor general of the country ya allah the more i read your comments the more i cringe the prosecutor general is a mubarak crony you fool he would make trumped up charges against all of mubarak's political opponents why do you protect this criminal he has no right to continue his job as pg you are such an idiot you need to remove all of mubarak's bureaucracy in order to succeed a revolution simply removing one man does not change the country canceling relations with syria at a rally at a soccer stadium he was completely right to do your arab brethren in syria are getting slaughtered by the barbaric tyrant bashar asaad or do you support this tyrant and sponsoring sectarian violence against christians and shia please give me video proof that he literally said 'go and spread violance against christians and shia ' otherwise you are lying right now so while you sit in your leftist hellhole in the west thinking you know what is best for the people in egypt based on your total lack of knowledge i'm no leftist my foolish friend i get called an islamist or right wing bigot by leftists funny how leftists don't like you anyway because they know what a shambles the 'liberal elite' of egypt are those on the ground were seeing the path to freedom in egypt darken and were seeing the brotherhood attempt to permanently alter the very identity of the egyptian people the ones of the ground were the misled ones that's why egypt is now the laughing stock of the century the population of people who begged for dictatorship to return that is why the people in the west believe your people are not read for democracy westerners put up with governments for years while you cannot even go through year of civilian government perhaps they are right and you do not deserve democracy military intervention is not perfect it never is but this one was necessary and has the support of the vast majority of the egyptian people who know much better than you about which institution is better for egypt you ignorant fool the rest of the world watch is shock how you asked the institution that was okay with years of mubarak and supported him for years was begged to return the army should never ever interfere with politics because they are the source of problem and corruption in your country egypt has one of the highest illiteracy rates in the world how can you tell me that the vast majority know much better about which institution is better you pathetic leftist idealists in the west who think they can impose their ill informed vision of the world on other people make me sick i live in a st world country whose poverty level is tiny compared to egypt's and whose economy is a mountain compared to egypt and whose freedom of speech and political stability is much better compared to egypt as such i am in a better position to judge than you who has never lived in real democracy and only dictatorship that is why the people of the world have advised you not to trust the army you have been misled and egypt will suffer greatly for this the people in the 'we are khalid said' group that started the jan revolution are already against the coup the april movement is also against the coup i am not a leftist so you can stop trying to make excuses for the shitty state of your country you make the world laugh at your stupidity""]"

among its first victims what caused the crisis was investment banks bundling risky mortgages into incomprehensible financial instruments which they then sold as solid safe investments to investors who clamored for more and more this created pressure on the investment banks to buy more mortgages they went to the private mortgage banks begging for more mortgages and not asking any questions about how risky they were so the mortgage banks wrote mortgages no sane person would write because they were offloading the risk almost instantly then to insure against any downside banks and others bought credit default swaps a completely unregulated form of insurance remember aig that's what took them down they sold cds's for far more than they could ever dream of covering so when it started going south it all went south really fast fannie and freddie weren't allowed to buy and bundle subprime mortgages btw"", ""exactly correct susanna what the combined bush obama rescue effort did was reward

largely awol throughout the build up to the collapse the worst outcome of all is that smaller banks paid for it with their lives in sum it is not america that does not really want a black middle class it is the american federal government that does not really want a black middle class"", ""the reason that bankers aren't in prison for causing the financial crisis is that bankers didn't cause it the government did anyone who says differently is lying and trying to doge their own responsibility blaming bankers is a century long tradition of politicians going all the way back to medieval murder riots against jewish money lenders that keeps working for politicians because most people don't have the vaguest idea how banks work this article is an example of this vile practice still be alive and well for example the government didn't bail out the banks the government bailed out depositors why because under fractional reserve banking banks don't have much money on their own instead they function as brokers between pools of depositors and borrowers if the bank fails the depositors loose their money or at least they did before the government started insuring deposits so that ordinary people didn't have to worry about losing money they put in banks if you still don't understand go watch it's a wonderful life a few times it actually explains the system fairly well the real cause of crisis was politicians and we the electorate artificially lowering interest rates for borrowers by offloading the financial consequences of the risk of making bad loans off individual banks and putting it on the u s federal government instead freddie mac fannie mae and host of lessor programs all existed to buy up mortgages from banks bundle and repackage them into financial instrument and then sold them to large investors worldwide investors bought the instruments because there was a wink and nod understanding that the feds would make the instrument good if something went wrong which it did when they did investors would accept a lower rate of return on the instruments in exchange for the lower risk what everyone forgot or never knew was that interest rates were information which communicated the risk of every loan to every depositor in the world wide system prior to freddie and fannie banking was largely local and regional local loans made with local depositors and local investors money no oil sheik in dubai would put money into a bank in des moines for residential mortgage lending because said sheik had no idea about the risk of making such loans in des moines but buying a u s government backed financial instrument no risk there the money flowed blindly in the government even made the problem worse by simply declaring by fiat that the instruments were rated a like treasury notes for purposes of the banks maintaining their fractional reserve so when system failed suddenly banks that had made good loans and obeyed the law to the letter found themselves suddenly legally insolvent overnight when their reserve went poof the government solved the problem again by fiat letting banks pretend they still had a reserve until the notes could be paid off the system worked more or less for nearly years because it started small and grew over a period of decades mortgages usually run to years so it took a long time for the real effects of the distortion to manifest as a bubble and most importantly the u s residential market is a huge system which took vast amounts of money and decades of time to distort like all bubbles it created a sense of prosperity because everyone seemed to making money hand over fist banks sold their loans to freddie et al so they made all their profits immediately instead of years down the road borrowers got vastly under market interest rates which let them purchase houses they really couldn't afford but which yielded big profits when sold or flipped investors got dividends and gold standard assets which they could borrow against so more and more money flowed into the residential housing market until eventually the market simply couldn't build anymore houses or absorb anymore money if money was cream then the system would have literally choked to death on it no banker broke a single law to cause the crisis bankers made bad loans because that was what the politicians designed the system to bribe and bully them to do in fact it those who did not participate for years who faced moral and lawsuit pressure to make loans the system was doomed from the start just like any system that tries to get something for nothing in the case free money from the difference between the higher free market interest rate and lower interest we the electorate should have known it was to good to be true the real villains in the story are those who created and sold the idea we could get something for nothing the truly vile are those politicos and activist who keep blaming the jews i mean bankers instead of admitting that it was their own ignorance arrogance and false promises that caused the problem the reason no one has gone to jail is because trials would force those who blame the jews i mean bankers sorry for the slip been reading about the medieval ages a lot recently to produce real evidence of actual crimes which they can't do so instead they weave elaborate fantasy narratives about corruption and failure in the justice system it's an old doge that's been used in many domains from accusing the us military of widespread atrocities in vietnam then doing nothing about it when they had the power to do so i've got john kerry on video and the congressional record so don't even try to deny it oil companies were blamed for the energy crisis when it was wage and price controls that triggered it and windfall profits tax that maintained it that's why reagan ended years of economic hell with a literal stroke of the pen yet the very people who caused the problem brayed the loudest for criminal prosecution of oil executives the california electrical implosion was supposed to have been criminal behavior as well but again they had a designed a system doomed to fail free market prices on the provider end but fixed prices on the consumer end so the candy store owner pays free market price candy makers but the price he can charge is fixed by the state how long does the candy store stay in business how long to people make candy at a loss our system of law and governance is so constructed that huge numbers of actors principled or not have huge incentives to seek criminal justice against anyone who breaks the law and causes big problems as the op mentions people at enron went to jail because they broke the law so you can always tell where the real problem lays if there's a lot braying for blood but nobody goes to jail then problem wasn't caused by some evil minority like je bankers breaking the law it's likely those screaming the loudest in the lynch mob it's a great way to tell

reality is conceivable yes paterno could cross paths with or walk alongside someone he knew could well be on his way to raping kids however obsessed with ratings the media may be doesn't alter the truth of this reality a reality that needs no ratings boost hype contrary to these vegetabolic assertions there was no media report claiming paterno was himself a child molester if some pollster asked such a dumb question deserves whatever answer he received paterno was the enablement of sandusky these vegetables would have one believe that residing within that crevice is a necessary qualification for understanding the freeh report whereupon one would find no evidence against paterno outside that crevice one does know a few things these vegetables stuck inside it don't the emails in question regarding being updated about were refering to updating paterno because informing sandusky of content in the third person that sandusky would or had already experienced makes no sense because informing the subject of an investigation of the workings and progress of the investigation is not done as universally known basic investigative policy because paterno is named in the header in one of them because schultz later emailed in that they would let sandusky know they knew about which would make no sense if these emails were refering to updating sandusky schultz's email makes clear that neither paterno nor his lackeys ever contacted sandusky about at the time this brain cell killing propaganda the myth that paterno being the one updated is a gross unfounded extrapolation commonly fills these pro paterno mind munchers the world at large is very aware of this sewerage it does not not know about it contrary to this author's fit of delusion that he's somehow a beacon of exclusive paterno knowledge the conclusion that paterno was the receptor of the sandusky update emails does not rest on a thin reed curiously or otherwise it rests on the base of a live oak the investigation was aborted under mysterious and irregular circumstances paterno knew about and he also knew the image remained intact due to its conclusion undoubtedly the paterno penn state cesspool extended within and without the whole locality and all the local and state organizations involved the police district attorney's office dpw cys sandusky's organization etc as this author has done one of these vegetables' favorite tactics is to point this out as if the width of the cesspool somehow absolves its center paterno the focus of the corruption for all these entities was directed toward serving paterno interests the maintenance of the football program's perfect image in many cases these entities had a vested interest themselves in the maintenance of the football program's image so defined by it were the economy and other aspects of the community made up of these maniacs how exactly these entities conspired together in their corruption may never be known what extent paterno was directly complicit or whether paterno was a protected principal such that his desired course of action as perceived by these entities was carried out without his direct interaction allowing him plausible deniability what is known is that paterno was anxious to know where it stands it refering to paterno's interests vis a vis these entities' activities regarding sandusky to maintain the perfection of the image it was first necessary to arrange a prop through which the sandusky investigation could be conveniently ended some ignorance craving preordained non pedophile report by some willing lackey beholden to one of the organizations was contrived it was then seized upon as an excuse to nullify the extracted sandusky confession professional consensus that sandusky's actions met the criteria of a typical pedophile and the incriminating victim testimony and order the immediate cessation of any and all investigative activities of sandusky by all involved entities dpw cys local police university police and the district attorney's office but that wasn't enough it was also necessary to concoct the fraudulent perception that sandusky was totally acquitted should ever come to light sandusky needed to be sanitized of any hint of any association with child molestation some action taken to promote the perception that the investigation was thorough and conclusive enough to absolutely exonerate sandusky of child abuse in any form that was what a perfect image required sandusky was granted the exceptional honor and privelege of emeritus status and its accompanying full access to university resources unprecedented for someone in his position a corrupt power representing paterno's interests gave the predator full and total access to his prey even building the gingerbread house for the sake of the image the best way to concoct the image that a suspected pedophile was not a suspected pedophile that there was utterly no reason whatsoever to suspect him was to enable him to the fullest as if joe paterno had tried to find ways to help jerry sandusky rape children for decades there is no as if whoever or whatever that corrupt power representing paterno's interests was it was power it was corrupt and it was within penn state and only the entrapped vegetables would argue that paterno would not have had imput on the issue and that imput was not effectively dictatorial sandusky must have come to realize that his perverse activities were implicitly sanctioned by paterno and penn state this sanction was reinforced every time he strolled by security with children in tow after being told by penn state since that he was prohibited from bringing children with him when using penn state facilities that prohibition was enforced by a police force of one who was never on duty schultz since the campus police could not be informed of the prohibition without cracking the image as if schultz the only even remote connection to law enforcement with knowledge that sandusky was a suspected pedophile would have stopped him anyway undoubtedly sandusky was aware of paterno's intense desire to protect the image and cover up his perversions throughout the whole interval from until he was finally busted paterno essentially invited sandusky to act with ever more brazen depravity and recklessness as a form of blackmail payoff in this regard sandusky did not dissappoint paterno the paterno lackeys deliberated for weeks whether they should obey the law and the basics of common decency in why did an action that required only the bare minimum of morals intellect and time notifying the police transmogriphy into this grotesque prolonged devils' conference did evil just hit the jackpot with these lackeys comprising the nominal leadership of this alleged university just happening to come from some pool of dumb devils because violating the law was a possible option under the paterno dictatorship with the mission of maintaining the image at all costs the sole overriding objective by trying to predict paterno's desired course of action they could serve paterno's interests while allowing him to maintain plausible deniability having finally decided to report this decision was not made for any moral reasons or to abide by the law which they were already in violation of since the requirement to report is immediate rather the decision was made entrusting that the corrupting influences serving paterno's interests that aborted keeping the image intact could be relied on to do so again the lackeys believed that this attempt at keeping the image intact was paterno's choice at least that was the course of action they hoped paterno desired however curry wasn't comfortable with it meaning he wasn't sure that was what paterno wanted and consulted with paterno or maybe it was curry's job since he worked the closest under paterno to seek final approval confirmation through some code symbol or other oblique means after the working group of lackey corrupters had decided the course of nefarious action to be taken purposefully without paterno's participation as the protected principal in any case the decision to report was not what paterno wanted paterno knew better than his lackeys that mcquery's testimony was too powerful to entrust to the police especially since the well of corruption may have been tapped out by the investigation even if this reservoir of toxic waste was undiminished this was a direct observation of sexual contact by a responsible adult not some unwitnessed assault that could be contorted into some boundary issue just the mention of paterno in curry's email and the lackeys fall all over themselves in a rush to commit crimes the only questioning was spanier's vulnerability email a plea to curry to make sure that paterno was fully aware of the consequences should sandusky be caught so that he might reconsider today these lackeys are still bound to paterno knowing with their avowed know nothing defense having been shredded by freeh's exposure of their secreted emails that one of their few avenues for future freedom rests on a jury nullification verdict from a jury comprised of these paterno worshiping vegetables this know nothing defense combined with continued servitude to a corpse as well as the desire and ability for other as yet unindicted powerful paternol slavers to cover up their roles does not bode well for the exploration of this cesspool to any futher depths to wait for the full exploration of this ocean sized cesspool to pass any judgement on paterno as these vegetables advise as their idea of due process is to never condemn paterno even though paterno through his own mouth has condemned paterno after talking with joe secreted email or not this wasn't supposed to have been typed and sent but it was because the lackeys couldn't bring themselves to commit crimes without being spoon fed orders by paterno a pure accident but the coup de 'etat for the reasoning rational world the exercise of paterno's power paterno's motivation paterno's actions as related in the freeh report and encapsulated in those four words all consistent with paterno's character past motivation past actions and the paterno dictatorship environment but to these vegetables a thin reed supposition assumptions no evidence paterno covered up for a child rapist solely and only to protect himself and the football program this diseased worm did this deliberately and willfully and conciously over years every waking moment and every sleeping moment this pus pile dared to dream a devil masquerading as a saint if this disease could have said anything to salvage what was left of his and the football program's image could have explained it he would have after all he was the master in the art of concocting an image to a state of perfection to the extent that reality became a byproduct of image in the end what brought this disease to tears was not all the lives he destroyed it was the death of the love of his life the only thing he ever cared about his image if paterno died because his purpose in life had ended it wasn't football it was image maintenance all that's left that can be said about paterno is that he was about as pathetic a piece of pus that has ever walked this earth in response to the outing of paterno the author overdoses on slanderous vitriol against dr triponey the only one who ever stood up to paterno can this author understand this it's because of this paterno devil worshiping culture he's writing this column from the abyss of university hell trying to explain why he's still worshiping paterno while he is not or why he quit worshiping him while he still is and to the extent that he's not still worshiping him the reason he's not is because he knows there would be no paterno if there were no people like him she opposed paterno she was the only one she was your path to salvation infinitely more important than the fate of these rabidites she was those kids' salvation having rejected it and ended up in this purgatory of universal contempt and scorn as the root cause of this deviltry so this is the time to curse her beyond insane beyond ignorance beyond evil cursing the air one breathes praising the enabling of one of the worst crimes imaginable while these blind gutless worms were shaping their cocoons dr triponey attempted to perform her duties in conformance with her job specifications and penn state's own written policies which mandated treating football players the same as other students in regard to student discipline which meant the cracking of the image thus she was fired by paterno her career destroyed by paterno and his lackeys so that paterno and his lackeys could ensure that what they knew could be happening could continue the raping of kids dr triponey had a choice to make she could turn her life into a stick of furniture for a fraudulent facade as already were her job description and the policy dictates she was trying to enforce as all the others had done that was the penn state way or she could retain her humanity intellect and soul in a just perfect world a cocoon inhabitor like this author would be in no position to utter her name much less slander her how deep within the chasm must this author be glued to even bring up some disagreement over some other policy decision what relationship is student radio funding to child rape or to its causitive agent paterno want another policy decision disagreement what about the disagreement over whether testimony of witnesses to a crime should be encouraged or discouraged something is so wrong so beyond the pale of human decency for an institution supposedly dedicated to the betterment of mankind to actually support paterno's view that discouragement is the correct policy that was the opinion of the president of this cesspool but not dr triponey's and not society's because no society can function that way that policy has been deemed to be illegal it's called obstruction of justice what is the author's opinion if there were a slither of a soul left in this paterno slaver maybe just maybe but this cave dweller would probably need to be beat to a pulp by a gang of thugs in the midst of a crowd of onlookers and when the perpetrators are apprehended and then let go because no one would testify to have any chance of seeing light of course she was going to be interviewed in the wake of paterno's outing she said she didn't take any joy in it what is it she could have said that would satisfy this cocoon inhabitor that she wasn't taking her sweet revenge by dancing on paterno's grave what anything and why would that matter in the first place this is child rape why contaminate the one instance of heroic dissent against the corrupt rotten power structure that made child rape possible with this maggot's grave what tiny black hole of a universe is this coming from maybe knowing that but for him and those like him the monstrous crimes against children would have stopped is the reason they're sick they're mad they are hopeless no paterno worshiping mob no paterno no paterno no fake image no fake image no enablement of sandusky no enablement of sandusky no sandusky no sandusky no child rape no paterno worshiping mob no child rape it must be hard to look into a mirror which is why the english french channel tunnel borer couldn't extricate them from the darkness they will be as diseased lemmings tomorrow as they were yesterday they've learned nothing and can learn nothing

can change not with these rabid maniacs still dominating and there is nothing but rabid maniacs or catatonic vegetables in this cesspool by its president's own admission the only reason it accepted

did construction labor in high school or college i know quite a few people who were making very good money in skilled trades who are now doing other things none of them were displaced by illegal immigrants a friend of mine who used to be a mason and is now a diesel mechanic lost his work i won't say job because the economy went in the crapper and no one wanted to build new homes or businesses for several years frankly your argument is all over the place you're talking about labor participation which is a function of general labor demand and demographics not just labor demand for local work like construction and as i've already pointed out and as you continually ignore because it destroys your argument labor demand in aggregate is being affected by overseas labor markets things like hand tools furniture or appliances that used to be american made are now churned out of a factory in china if you really want to understand where the middle class went in america that's where but you're not really interested you're not interested in knowing what's true you're interested in blaming illegal immigration which has very little effect on the total economy the moment that american corporations could shift their manufacturing to mexico without any trade barriers and then to asia the demand for american workers began to decline"", ""wow a reasonable comment i would give you a participation prize but that is frowned upon these days you seem to assume i have no sympathy for american workers why because i have sympathy for immigrants too this is wrong i don't hate american workers as i work with them every day in the construction industry a mix of skilled and unskilled labor a lot of immigrants with green cards but white and latino americans too automation will take jobs but i don't think low skilled laborers will ever be unnecessary it is funny that when we talk of raising the minimum wage we are told these are jobs for kids not full grown adults trying to raise a family but when immigrants fill these jobs we are told they are taking them away from american workers and lowering wages well which is it i have fought my whole life to have stronger protections wages etc for all workers i am not going to hate on or blame immigrants because corporate america has been screwing the whole country for years"", ""ok it is a complex issue i'll back off my statement solely blaming the wealthy for example construction was heavily impacted by the housing crisis to some extent and in some areas this has recovered but the construction industry overall was part of a bubble that has burst essentially downsized have middle class workers been replaced by lower class workers probably because construction companies are trying to reduce costs and stay afloat this is a common scenario that has played out in many industries do we blame immigrants for this no it is a function of a changing economy however less than ethical owners of construction companies may be taking advantage of this by hiring cheaper workers even if they don't need to as lower wages increase profits i know some owners of construction companies and they aren't hurting personally at all i'm glad you are in it because this is a field that isn't going away any time soon i'm not sure about the employee market in it however with regard to your statement that there is no shortage of qualified americans to do this work there may be no shortage but are they willing to work for lower wages as are many immigrants i have friends in the raleigh nc and boulder co areas which are it software hotspots and there are large indian and asian immigrant worker contingents i find it hard to imagine that these workers are that much more competent than american counterparts so why are they hired they likely work for lower wages so why is this the immigrants' 'fault' it's not it's the companies that do the hiring as they make greater profits with lower wage workers a similar situation exists with say farm workers or unskilled laborers in my area you see very few white laborers in this category they are largely hispanic why the white workers simply won't do the same work as the immigrants for the same pay they would rather sit on their butts and collect unemployment welfare there is plenty of work but the whites just won't do it so in this case you could blame entitlements i e if the whites couldn't go on welfare would they work probably but they have already been out competed by the immigrant labor force if they don't gain some skills or job training they are out of luck this country was built by immigrants i see no reason why this should change let the market decide who works and who doesn't the aspect of the job market that should be controlled in this instance is the profit margin of companies who hire workers and the incomes of the owners of these companies so that inappropriate i e solely to pad the pockets of shareholders owners hiring of low wage workers is
