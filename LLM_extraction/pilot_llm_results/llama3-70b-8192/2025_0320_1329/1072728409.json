  "article_body": "Illegal immigrant \u201cDreamers\u201d attempting to seek asylum may be becoming a new \u201csocial class\u201d according to aNew Yorkerreport.Recently, a group of thirty-six people called the \u201cDream 30\u201d went to Mexico and tried to re-enter the United States through Laredo, Texas on Monday seeking political asylum. Most of those \u201cDreamers\u201d were wearing caps and gowns while chanting, \u201cUndocumented, unafraid.\u201dMohammad Abdollahi, described as a \u201c27-year-old Iranian-born, Michigan-bred leader of the National Immigrant Youth Alliance (N.I.Y.A),\u201d which coordinates these activities, \u00a0said these \u201cDreamers\u201d are asking for asylum because they are \u201cinstant targets\u201d in Mexico. Asylum seekers must \u201cprove not only that they have a credible fear of violence, but also that the threat is specifically tied to their identity or political and religious beliefs.\u201dThe \u201cDream 30,\u201d like the\u201cDream 9\u201dbefore them who pulled a similar stunt, are claiming they will be kidnapped or extorted because those in Mexico think they are rich and connected because of their American ties.According to theNew Yorker, \u201cless than forty-eight hours after being taken into custody, seven of the thirty-six participants had been released into the U.S.\u201d Although their \u201crelease only means that their asylum appeal will run its course\u201d because \u201ca vast majority\u00a0of asylum claims are rejected,\u201d it \u201cmay be years before they make a court appearance.\u201dIf Congress passes a comprehensive immigration reform bill that provides a pathway to citizenship or a bill\u2013like the onereportedly being discussedin the House between House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)\u2013that would legalize the children of illegal immigrants who were brought to America as children, these \u201cDreamers\u201d could be granted legal status while presumably waiting for their asylum hearings.Carlos Spector, described as a prominent immigration attorney in El Paso, observed that \u201cthese kids went into detention as undocumented immigrants, and came out as political refugees.\u201d Another lawyer who has worked with the group said,\u00a0\u201cDreamers are a new social class.\u201dN.I.Y.A. members are taking other actions, like infiltrating federal detention centers to make illegal immigrants aware of their rights, that prompted an \u201cexpert at the Center for American Progress\u201d to comment that they were the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d of a new immigration movement.",
