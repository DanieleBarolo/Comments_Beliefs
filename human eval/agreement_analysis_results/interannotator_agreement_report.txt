INTER-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT ANALYSIS
==================================================

OVERALL METRICS
------------------------------
topic_selection_agreement: 52.93% ± 37.60%
modified_jaccard_score: 97.64% ± 2.44%
stance_direction_agreement: 87.55% ± 5.99%

EXPLANATION OF METRICS
------------------------------
1. Topic Selection Agreement (Jaccard Score):
   - Measures how much annotators agree on WHICH topics to annotate
   - Calculated as: intersection / union of topics annotated by either annotator
   - Higher values indicate better agreement on topic selection

2. Modified Jaccard Score:
   - Accounts for both mutual annotations AND mutual omissions
   - Calculated as: (shared annotations + shared omissions) / total topics
   - Useful since most topics are left blank by both annotators

3. Stance Direction Agreement:
   - Measures agreement on HOW topics were annotated (positive/negative stance)
   - Calculated as: total directional matches / total shared annotations (for the pair's set of comments)
   - Treats E+/I+ as the same direction, E-/I- as the same direction
