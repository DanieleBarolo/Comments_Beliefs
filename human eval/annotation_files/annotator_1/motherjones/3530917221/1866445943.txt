How about you drive down to the bank, empty your bank account and distribute the money to those homeless veterans that the 'Republican Whoops!' created?  Just saying, where's my free oil the Republicans promised me?  Finally, what's the difference between the Bush Cartel and ISIS?  None that I can see.

      I do try to be tactful and sensitive to the feelings of our conservative brethren who may listen to Mr. O'Reilly . I certainly wouldn't want to offend any of those nimrods .

        Just be honest about your feelings, as you OBVIOUSLY are!  I don't care if people agree/disagree.

MY thoughts/feelings are important to ME.

I don't love Brian Williams or Bill O'Reilly.  Don't care!

I have no skin in the game.
