I am sure "Libs" lie.  However, cons make a career of it:  Much to the detriment of the nation.

      I do try to be tactful and sensitive to the feelings of our conservative brethren who may listen to Mr. O'Reilly . I certainly wouldn't want to offend any of those nimrods .

              Okay.  I agree. I don't have the problem with FOX that a lot of people have.  They push their agenda every day as EVERY news organization does, however, every now and then they get something right. lol!

I find it funny as hell that Bill O'Reilly talked about Brian Williams like a dog, while knowing all along that he also embellished stories.  LOL!!  You can't make this sh!t up!!!

He's now caught in the same quagmire as Brian Wiliams!  There IS a GOD!!!!  LOL!  God is good; God is kind.

Six month suspension or OFF WITH HIS HEAD!

                  They aren't lying about facts they just have wacko opinions about said facts, nothing in politics is black and white enough to lie about

                    Yes, they do lie.   And they use innuendo to the nth degree.
They are deceptive and outright liars.
And that is a fact you cannot dispute because they have been proven liars over and over again.
