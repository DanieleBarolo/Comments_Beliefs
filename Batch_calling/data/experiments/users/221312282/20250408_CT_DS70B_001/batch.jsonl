From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were cut off from their food supplies and starved to death or rounded up and exterminated. Germany established gun control in 1938. From 1939 to 1945, 10 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one to two million &apos;educated&apos; people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. In 1956 no one in Cambodia could imagine total confiscation and citizen enslavement in the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;, ... but per capita, more citizens were eventually murdered by their own government than in any other country in history. TOTAL number of defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 53 million. And this is a VERY low, conservative estimate. Professor R.J. Rummel says it is closer to 170 MILLION.\n\nJust my 2 cents on the issue of more gun control and I'll never support giving the government more.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe logical corollary to banning so-called \"assault weapons\" due to a mass shooting would be to ban either alcoholic beverages or automobiles after a drunk driver kills a bunch of people.

Thus the decision in Griswold v. Connecticut was based on bad law.\nGriswold v. Connecticut was a case where Connecticut banned the use of the US Mail to share information on contraception.

Instead they decided to destabilize Russia, which was no threat to Europe post 1989. NATO moved relentlessly eastward and the line was drawn by Putin at Ukraine. The destabilizing campaign was forged around a puppet and corrupt Ukraine. In 2014 the die was cast with the ouster of a pro Russian regime in Ukraine. The war in the Donbass was heated up with 14000 pro Russian deaths. Zelensky was elected to fight the corruption and cool the hot war in the Donbass, instead he reneged on both. Here we are, the Russian war aims have always centered on the Donbass. The initial incursion to the west and Kiev probed whether Zelensky would collapse and to draw resources from the Donbass. Now the Russians are meticulously destroying  the siege capability of the UKR forces  in the Donbass. The economic warfare of the US and EU blew up in their faces. Russia and China are moving to create an anti western bloc in Asia and Africa.

The first was the USS Ward spotting and attacking a Japanese midget sub outside Pearl Harbor. As the captain of the Ward was a new guy (first command, assumed two days before the attack), the Navy response was to ask for confirmation.\nSeveral minutes later, the radar station at Opana Point picked up a flight of aircraft coming from the north. They phoned the Information Center at Fort Shafter. The person there had not had any training other than a brief orientation in mid-November, and was only doing his second ever shift there. He had heard that a group of B-17s were flying in from the mainland, and assumed that Opana Point had picked them up. His response would haunt him the rest of his life - \"Don't worry about it.\"\nWhat also made matters worse was that there was no working together by the Army and the Navy. Each service was addressing each event on their own. The Army knew nothing about the Ward's submarine, and the Navy knew nothing about the Opana Point contact. Had there been a unified command in Hawaii, both reports would have arrived at the same place and roughly at the same time, and someone might have realized that something big was about to happen.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Here is your role model to put up on a mural to honor. To emulate. There has to be something the scientists can identify and copy, this inner trait in the heart, that makes men such as those crossing the Delaware on Christmas Night, 1776, in the snow and ice, some just wearing socks, to battle a superior enemy resting 10 miles to the south in Trenton, NJ. Or those brave soldiers who were dropped onto a Normandy Beach, with Nazi machine gun bullets whizzing all around their skulls. Watching the man just standing next to them, gunned to shreds. Or the firefighters and police who were going UP the Twin Towers, while citizens were fleeing for their lives, going down. Or a young black navy man, on an early Sunday Morning, December 7, 1941, who never dreamed the world around him was going to be reduced to flames and screams of agony in a matter of minutes. I am forever grateful to live in a country that still honors true heros like Dorie Miller. Our American heroes always seem to be ordinary men; who in the most dangerous of times, do extraordinary deeds.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThe only time in my childhood my father ever paid attention to my schoolwork, was when I was doing a book report on Dori Miller. My father snatched the book from me and asked where I got it. Of course I told him the school library. My father then explained that he had served with Dori. He could see the disbelief in my eyes, stormed out of the room and after some considerable noise, came back with a picture of Dori and him, in their navy uniforms, smiling for the camera. He spent the next hour telling me story after story of him and his Navy brothers and then just like that, he went back in his shell.

The classic was the Tenerife disaster in 1977, where two 747s collided on the runway. It's still the very worst air disaster in history. Failures in ATC were greatly responsible, with improper improper terminology resulting in one 747 thinking that they were clear for takeoff when they were not. Also not helping was the use of an improper call sign for the aircraft that was taxying, which meant that the aircraft taking off didn't realize that the taxying aircraft was still on the runway. Throw in evidence that the controllers were distracted by a football game on the radio and the fact that they couldn't see the runway due to thick clouds, and you had a disaster waiting to happen.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Why? The M4A3E8 had better fire control (including better optics), a turret basket (very nice to keep the loader from being killed as he's trying to reload the gun), a roomier turret (better ergonomics and lower gun depression), as well as a FM radio (it was very rare that Soviet tanks had any radio at all, and FM is less likely to have reception issues with all that metal).\nThe T34 total production (of all models) during the war was 54,550. Of these, 44,900 were total losses (these figures, BTW, are from the Russians themselves).
