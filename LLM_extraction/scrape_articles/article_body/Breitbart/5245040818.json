{"title": "Telegraph: U.S. Top Country for Gun Ownership, Not Even in Top 10 for Firearm Deaths", "body": "On October 22The Telegraphpublished a map showing the U.S. leads the world in private firearm ownership but does not even crack the Top 10 when it comes to firearm-related deaths.According to theTelegraph, the countries with highest per-capita gun ownership are:USA – 112.6 guns per 100 residentsSerbia – 75.6Yemen – 54.8Switzerland – 45.7Cyprus – 36.4Saudi Arabia – 35Iraq – 34.2Uruguay – 31.8Sweden – 31.6Norway – 31.3Note–theTelegraphpresents gun ownership as so expansive in the U.S. that guns actually outnumber people. Yet the U.S. does not appear on the list of the Top 10 countries for firearm-related deaths. Those countries are:Honduras – 67.18 per 100,000 residents per yearVenezuela – 59.13Swaziland – 37.16Guatemala – 34.1Jamaica – 30.72El Salvador – 26.77Colombia – 25.94Brazil – 21.2Panama – 15.11Uruguay – 11.52The map and the accompanyingTelegrapharticle were drawn from theSmall Arms Surveyand the2012 Congressional Research Serrvice Report. AsBreitbart News previously reported, the CRS report shows privately owned firearms jumped from 192 million in the U.S. in 1994 to 310 million in 2009. At the same time, the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” rate–which was 6.6 per 100,000 Americans in 1993–fell to 3.6 per 100,000 by 2000. Gun sales continued to surge and the “firearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide” rate fell to 3.2 in 2011.Think about it–as gun ownership rose, the murder rate plummeted in the U.S. Couple that with the fact that only one of the Top 10 countries for gun ownership is also in the Top 10 for firearm-related deaths–Uruguay is number eight for gun ownership number 10 for gun deaths–and the point is clear: More guns correlate with less crime.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the host ofBullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
