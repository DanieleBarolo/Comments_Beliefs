  "comment_texts": "The question is how the Republican Party is viewing this falling out between Obama\nand big labor. Is should be a great opportunity to use this as an effective tool to prove\nhow toxic this health care law is. But the DC Repubs, so stupid they are, that even \nwhen they are given these \"gifts\" they are unable to come up with anything\nto put Obama and his supporters on the defensive. Their leader, Boehner, is\nonly concerned about keeping his job as speaker, that he's just paralyzed...or\nhe's just brainless. The Republican party is pathetic!",
