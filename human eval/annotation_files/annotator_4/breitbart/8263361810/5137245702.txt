WTF is Bill Hemmer doing at that board giving useless information??
Someone clue this genius in that the numbers that matter is <b>current lead and percentage of votes already tabulated.</b> It is simple Algebra from once he gives you this pertinent info. Not results from 2016 where because of death, 4 years worth of senior citizen passing away are skewed by young, mostly liberal voters aged 18-22 replacing them on the voter rolls. 

What matters in calculating is this: At 3 AM Biden leads in Wayne County (Detroit) MI by  206,019 to 145,284 with only <b>37% of the votes counted</b>. that is +/- 65000 votes. This means via Algebric equation  Biden can cut into Trump's 308,000 vote lead by about +/-115,000 at most in the largest voting block in the state ... 

When you hover your mouse over the rest of the blue blocks making up the tally for the state of Michigan, see the percentage of votes already counted and do a little quick math, you realize it is nearly impossible for Biden to make up the 308,000 votes he trails by.

The MSM is making Trump seem like the underdog, and biden the expected winner. Its the same fake leftwing narrative they used in 2016 all over again...truly shameless propaganda...
...
Please say a Prayer for Trump, and the Victory for the American people on election day, with another 4 years of Trump as POTUS, and The Senate and House under Republican control.

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come;
thy will be done;
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.

GET OUT AND VOTE PATRIOTS!!!
