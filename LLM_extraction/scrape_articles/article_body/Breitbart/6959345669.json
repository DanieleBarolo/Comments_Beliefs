They responded to Mr Bailey’s claims by attacking the Tories.A Labour Party spokesman said: “Labour does not tolerate racism of any kind. We won’t take any lessons from the Tories who deliberately targeted Diane Abbott in their negative general election material.”London Assembly Member Keith Princecommented: “Appalling abuse from Labour members to [Mr Bailey]. Anyone involved should be kicked out of the Labour Party.“Will [Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn] and [Mr Khan] condemn the abusers?”Former Army officer and black Tory MP James Cleverlyadded: “Labour’s position: all racism is wrong, unless it’s aimed at a Tory.“The list of vile, racist abuse that [Mr Bailey] has received from Labour supporters is shocking.”Home Secretary Sajid Javidsaid he receivedsimilar racist abuse from Labour supporters and left-wingers when he got the job earlier this year, replacing Amber Rudd.And last year, posh Labour MP Emma Dent CoadbrandedMr Bailey a “token ghetto boy”, “scumbag”, and “low-life” for his right-wing views.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/10/09/leftists-labour-members-racially-abuse-black-tory-london-mayoral-candidate/"}
