It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

PARENT COMMENT:
It is possible to manufacture a safe vaccine, George.  Like without mercury and other toxic or  living substances.  But that's not what's happening.  Nice dodge on all of the questions I asked. (Not).  If you believe you can trust vaccines, get them.  But don't decide for everyone, and demand that vaccines are safe before they are offered to the public. You might try researching where polio came from in the first place, BTW.

Parents should have every right to decline the vaccinations for their kids.  Since you were obviously born yesterday, I will enlighten you--modern medicine is corrupted, by several groups, including the AMA, ADA, FDA, and WHO.  This has made profits and political interests more important than actual health and lives.  The tiniest bit of objective research will prove my assertion.  You can easily judge how truthful and knowledgeable the medical field is in america by asking 3 basic questions:  is flouride poison or is it good for humans?  2. Is Marijuana safer than the 10 best selling antidepressant/anti-anxiety prescription medications, and how many suicides, overdoses, and other deaths are attributed to each method per year? 3. With Fukushima pouring radioactive materials into the ocean and air since the 3/11 tsunami, how serious is the danger to american citizens, and how is this being handled by the  American Medical Association, mainstream media, etc., and how responsibly have the president and other elected officials been in warning us, helping us protect ourselves, giving us valuable and true data and information,  and by working hard with scientists to find a solution to the storage and handling of radioactive materials in a disaster situation?

  Just because kids aren't stricken by polio or die of pertussis anymore doesn't mean those diseases have gone away. It's obvious you were born the day before yesterday, because I remember polio before Salk and Sabin. Get your head out of the sand!
