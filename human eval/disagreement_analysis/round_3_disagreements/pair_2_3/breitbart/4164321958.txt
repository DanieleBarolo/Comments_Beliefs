Motive exactly! It's in the interests of the Democrat party to derail the Republican momentum, so the lefFtBI came up with their stooge posing as a "MAGABomber". What a convenient timing.

      We need Judicial Watch to request the text and email content of the arresting officers now. The cover-up is already underway.

        It wouldn't surprise me if the suspect had some connection to CNN. Fake news loves to be the victim. Either way, fake news is only reporting that it's a man in his 50's. No mention of prior arrests. If he was a MAGA hat wearing white supremacists, we'd have pictures and twitter feeds already.

Edit-
To all the hate spewing liberal trolls frothing at the mouth over the news reports that have been rolling out over the last few hours:

No one who is seriously discussing this as a false flag event expects the news media to report any differently then they are. You're wasting your breath with "I told you so" and "gotcha" comments. Go back to HuffPo where someone might pretend to give a crap what you have to say.

          Unless the guy was a spook the media already knows who this person is.

            Then I'm even more surprised there are no MAGA hat wearing white supremacist pictures lined up just in case he did get caught.

              The Trump Train Keeps Rolling Along....

The good news is that Sayo was arrested quickly.
We need to keep focused & vote for our lives. We need to defeat the Democrats, build the wall, & drain the swamp.

Like the Donald says, 'were going to win'. So, lets roll.

                Beyond violent anarchy, the Borg left has absolutely no agenda. They have no plan to better the lives of actual U.S. citizens. Despite the fact that the Democrat Party sponsors and funds numerous domestic terrorist organizations (blm , antifa, etc.) their current strategy is  to turn themselves into victims? Insanity. 

In today's  Democrat, we see the visage of a real life 21st century neo-Bolshevik. Countless millions of innocent people have died at the hands of Communists like those currently found in the DNC. These Borg leftist's ideological ancestors (Mao, Stalin, Che, Pol Pot, Castro, etc.) are responsible for the horrific murder of hundreds of millions of innocent working class men, women, and children. I'm not convinced that it's a question of not learning from past mistakes but more that Democrats are every bit as evil as their ancestors were; they have no respect for human life whatsoever, ideology will always trump the individual for the leftist.

Stop leftist violence, <b>VOTE GOP!!!

                  The LeftBI setup is on, supposedly the dude’s van is loaded with pro trump stickers..more than likely pasted up last night by the Mob DNC criminals.

So the guy is a nutcase libtard from New York City with prior terroristic charges against judges then suddenly transforms himself to a GOP Trump  supporter.  No Trump supporter such as myself would blow up the phenomenal MAGA campaign and do something stupid like this.

This is all to sway voters and a desperation attempt to change the outcome of the NOV. 6th election. Not going to happen!!
Vote Vote Vote Red and take a Patriot or two with you to the polls!

Lots of moronic TDS triggered trolls here today, go back into your comas and every night before bed say a prayer that “Donald J Trump is Our President” !!!

                    You can try to spin this but the guy is a register republican numnut.

So...how's feel being wrong (wrong side)? Cesar Sayoc a register republican..

 Keep listening to Trump, Hannity, Fox news, Rush and it will literately get people killed.
