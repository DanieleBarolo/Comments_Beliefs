OK, after losing his latest 'Legal Law Suit' in Michigan today, his team (Rudy & Co.), has a  brand new approach to attempting to flip the 2020 election, it's called 'Pasta Politics'... 

Just grab your favorite family's 'Macaroni', add in your best Mom's 'Sauce', blend it all together and throw it at the wall in the Court Hall... And ask the Judge if it really 'STICKS'??? How's that, your Honor?... 

Judge to Rudy; Take that worthless, senseless, twisted, illogical B/S and quit wasting my damn time!!! When you have any solid, concrete evidence, please put together a [case] that can I'll actually entertain... Don't dark my door again, with more of your yesterday's trash.

There's a reason Guiliani and Powell are laying out their case in a press conference instead of a courtroom.
