Republicans get themselves whipped into a frenzy.
Go to some of their sites, and the journalist will post a story of Obama gets a haircut. the comments section is full of the words, Kenyan, Muslim, Hates/destroying America, community organizer, marxist, nazi, a bunch of references to Jesus, etc, all upvoted about 100 times.
It's pretty funny watching the pack mentality get all worked up.

One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .

PARENT COMMENT:
Why does every new troll attempting to defend O'Lielly seem more unhinged than the last?
