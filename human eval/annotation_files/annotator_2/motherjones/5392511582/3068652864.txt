The standard of living only grew for those at the very top. Everybody ELSE'S dropped. And they believed Ray-Gun that if they went along with the con, they'd eventually get that gold-farting pink unicorn.

We need to get our representatives to explain to their constituents that there was Russian hacking, and yes, it did compromise the election, and, yes, it did skew the election to t rump.  When will it become a given that states with the easiest voting process have the most progressive congressional delegations.  I fear that there is a movement afoot by conservatives to instigate easily detectable fraud in a state with mail in ballots in order to say, " see! see! Making voting easier makes fraud easier."  .

"The Tea Party's ideas were wrong and their behavior was often horrible....We are better than this."

As they used to say on Mythbusters......"Well there's your problem." If we (should have) learned anything from this most recent electoral debacle it's that taking the high road landed us smack in a political ditch from which it may take years or even decades to extricate ourselves. We got Trumped, Bannoned, Comeyed, Putined and in every way imaginable screwed six ways from Sunday by the nastiest campaign of white-is-right fear and loathing since George Wallace.

The only way to stop Trumpism is take the gloves off and get down in the mud with the plug-uglies on the uber right, and that poses a yuge problem because far too many younger voters, who represent the future of the liberal/progressive/independent movement, were already disengaged because they felt that the whole political process was irretrievably corrupted by "the boomers" and was not something they wanted to soil themselves by participating in. The "conservatives" knew that and used it to their advantage. 

Clearly, Trump's strategy was to be so nasty and so crazy-like-a-fox.....to lie constantly on a level that can only be described as a pathological Gish Gallop for the ages, that he'd depress voter turnout on the left. And it worked in large part because:

(1) The allegedly liberal MSM refused to go after him  until it was much too late, 
(2) The right wing media celebrated the Gallop instead of excoriating it, 
(3) The FBI refused to go after Trump's campaign for its ties to Russia and instead joined in the Clinton-bashing, and
(4) Most of all, too many voters on the left bought into his campaign of slander and character assassination and decided that Hillary Clinton just wasn't trustworthy enough to deserve their votes in spite of repeated warnings that a protest vote or an abstention could lead to exactly the kind of sociocultural and environmental calamity we're facing today. 

Republicans need to be hammered relentlessly for their continued willingness to sell out to the corporate greed, Christian extremism, rampant homophobia, militant misogyny and racist filth that are now the hallmarks of Trumpism. There are 686 days until election day in 2018, but the decision to abandon the high road and prepare to get the proverbial hair mussed needs to come today or nothing is going to change. Trump has lowered the bar and it's going to stay low from now on. That's an ugly truth but in politics as in all things, "why fix something that works?"

PARENT COMMENT:
And then they chose him again. And they would choose him again today if they could. 

And standard of living grew 23.4% during the reagan years. 
Seems like people got what they were promised. 

If there had been 23.4% growth in the past 8 years Obama would be canonized and no republican could get elected dog catcher. 
But that did not happen - not because 23.4% growth in difficult to acheive. But because that was not what was important to the left.  And that is why you lost the rust belt.

    nothing......that is why it has now been dropped. That is why pussy-grabber isn't moving to prosecute, there wasn't anything to support such actions.

Just before the election, one of the FOX spin masters had to apologize for some comments made about both the emails and Benghazi, admitting that the claims she broke the law came from ONE ANONOMUS source......that isn't reporting. She was investigated over and over again, and no matter how hard they tried, the GOP came up with nothing.

                You mean when Reagan lied about selling missiles to Iran to finance drug gangs in Central America? Wake me up nutball when you understand the difference.

                    No Reagan claimed he had no knowledge of Iran Contra when NSA records clearly show that he insisted in being at every meeting. Of course this is also the same man who committed treason by negotiating with the mullahs of Iran as a private citizen to delay the hostage release until after the 1980 election. And no we didn't turn our back on anyone in Benghazi as even the GOP armed services congressional committee stated that everything that could have been done was. And there was no lie either as the CIA provide the best evidence at the time and their conclusions said it was a protest based on the video. Ironically the Libyan who led the attacks also blamed the same video for inciting him to attack the embassy.

                        So no comment on the treason committed by Reagan?

In 1980 Carter thought he had reached a deal with newly-elected Iranian President Abdolhassan Bani-Sadr over the release of the fifty-two hostages held by radical students at the American Embassy in Tehran.

Bani-Sadr was a moderate and, as he explained in an editorial for The Christian Science Monitor earlier this year, had successfully run for President on the popular position of releasing the hostages:

"I openly opposed the hostage-taking throughout the election campaign.... I won the election with over 76 percent of the vote.... Other candidates also were openly against hostage-taking, and overall, 96 percent of votes in that election were given to candidates who were against it [hostage-taking]."

Carter was confident that with Bani-Sadr's help, he could end the embarrassing hostage crisis that had been a thorn in his political side ever since it began in November of 1979.
But Carter underestimated the lengths his opponent in the 1980 Presidential election, California Governor Ronald Reagan, would go to screw him over.

Behind Carter's back, the Reagan campaign worked out a deal with the leader of Iran's radical faction - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini - to keep the hostages in captivity until after the 1980 Presidential election.

This was nothing short of treason. The Reagan campaign's secret negotiations with Khomeini - the so-called "October Surprise" - sabotaged Carter and Bani-Sadr's attempts to free the hostages. And as Bani-Sadr told The Christian Science Monitor in March of this year, they most certainly "tipped the results of the [1980] election in Reagan's favor."

Not surprisingly, Iran released the hostages on January 20, 1981, at the exact moment Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.

The "October Surprise" emboldened the radical forces inside Iran. A politically weakened Bani-Sadr was overthrown in June of 1981 and replaced with Mohammed Ali Rajai - a favorite of Khomeini's. These radical forces today are represented by people like former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hard-liners who oppose any deal with the United States and, like Khomeini in the 1980s, will jump at any chance to discredit the current moderate presidency of Hassan Rouhani.

The October Surprise also led to the deaths of thousands of innocent people around the world, and in Central America in particular. Reagan took money from the Iranians and used that money to kill nuns in Nicaragua.

But those are just the most obvious results of the October Surprise. Again, if Carter were able to free the hostages like he and Bani-Sadr had planned, Carter would have won re-election. After all, he was leading in most polls in the months leading up to the election. And if Reagan were never elected, America would be a much more progressive nation.

                            "The people 'chose' Reagan" because he promised them a million dollars tax-free and a magickal gold-farting pink unicorn in every garage, and "the people" believed him.
And so, after 35 years, how is all that working out for you?
