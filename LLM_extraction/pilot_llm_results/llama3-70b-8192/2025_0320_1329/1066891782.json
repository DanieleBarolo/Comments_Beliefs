The Family reunification act will\nbring in untold additional millions of immigrants into this country when the \"Amnesty Immigration Reform bill\" is passed by the Republican traitors in Congress. I have heard these politicians claim that many of the immigrants will be doing high tech jobs that few Americans are qualified to do. Yet the fact is the majority of the illegal immigrants who will be granted amnesty have very low education, and will be eligible for Obamacare; food stamps; low income housing; earned income tax credits, etc. It is a death sentence to to the US. Furthermore, amnesty attracts the flow more and more illegals into this country.\nThese Republicans are as corrupt as the Democrats, they are all in the pockets of big business.",
