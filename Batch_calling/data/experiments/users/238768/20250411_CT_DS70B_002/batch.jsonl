I remember the discussion of cultural biases in standardized testing in general back in the day, so I'm not sure if discussing differences in test scores reflect actual differences in IQ\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThere was this scientific test with a very large test group that proved conclusively that blacks are smarter than whites. The test was conducted last November 8th. Evidence provided in the form of the current occupant of the White House as opposed to the last occupant seems to bear this conclusion out. \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOr, y'know, fewer malnourished children than there used to be.

Some of the northern colonies/states had already abolished it by then, other northern states abolished it shortly thereafter. The southern states were deeply committed to keeping slavery; they wanted to expand it across the continent and down through Central America.\n\nThe Republican Party didn't even exist until the mid 1850's; it was founded almost entirely to oppose the expansion of slavery into new territories and states. It was ultra-liberal for the time. The Democrats (and what remained of other now-gone parties) were conservative. After the Civil War, Southern Democrats became even more conservative. Jim Crow was entirely on them. Republicans were still sporadically liberal; Ulysses S Grant, Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower were liberal Republicans. Hayes, Garfield, Taft, Coolidge and Hoover were more conservative. FDR was the first liberal Democrat. \n\nAfter the Civil Rights Act (1964), many of the liberals became Democrats, and many of the conservatives became Republican. Republicans became more conservative one issue at a time -- Nixon was lefty about the environment, unions, and health care but right-wing about foreign policy and drugs and judges. It wasn't until Reagan that Republicans became right-wing about everything, and people who were liberal about almost anything became Democrats.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022China\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Diversity\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
