In fact that may be the only hope for the long-term future it looks like, being able to live off of toxic water and air....just to make a buck.  Well there are always the fresh water lakes that can be sucked dry, developers probably ready to build on that new open shoreline land around Tahoe if that big of emergency happens.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAlthough the current war hysteria which holds Americans strangely hypnotized is centered around ISIS being the embodiment of all evil, a more realistic candidate would be fracking. 97 billion gallons of water were contaminated by it last year in drought stricken public lands in the United States. Now it is being allowed to poison our crops as well. The drive for fracking by Anadarko  Petroleum in Wyoming has just led to the beginning of extinction for wild horses in that state. The war going on in Syria and Iraq has as one of its causes a competition between two pipelines from fracking fields - one favoring Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the other favoring Iraq, Iran and Syria. ISIS is seeking to capitalize on chaos by disrupting both schemes while selling hi-jacked oil to Turkey. In terms of destruction done to human beings and the planet, ISIS is inconsequential and would not have arisen at all were it not for the race by fossil fuel interests to see who can squeeze out the last drop of oil and water from the planet before it dies - and the last drop of blood from the Persian Gulf area which has been at war over it continually for 24 years now!\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\non historical cycles I'm guessing WWIII to occur in 15-20 years - after devastating drought and famine cycles bring much of the world to grinding poverty and desperation - hope I'm wrong - but fear I'm not.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Police\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022China\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Scientists\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Enter Fracking.\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nAbout 38 years ago in zoology lab when evolution was being discussed a lot, I asked the TA what he thought may be the next big evolutionary change for man like another finger on our hands, etc.  He laughed at that and said no not an anatomy change, first will be the biochemical ability for humans to put up with lots more pollution that would have killed off the human race before.  In fact that may be the only hope for the long-term future it looks like, being able to live off of toxic water and air....just to make a buck.  Well there are always the fresh water lakes that can be sucked dry, developers probably ready to build on that new open shoreline land around Tahoe if that big of emergency happens.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAlthough the current war hysteria which holds Americans strangely hypnotized is centered around ISIS being the embodiment of all evil, a more realistic candidate would be fracking. 97 billion gallons of water were contaminated by it last year in drought stricken public lands in the United States. Now it is being allowed to poison our crops as well. The drive for fracking by Anadarko  Petroleum in Wyoming has just led to the beginning of extinction for wild horses in that state. The war going on in Syria and Iraq has as one of its causes a competition between two pipelines from fracking fields - one favoring Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the other favoring Iraq, Iran and Syria.
