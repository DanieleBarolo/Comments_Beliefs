It is once again obvious that Democrats can not see beyond their hatred of Trump and the people who voted for him. The drone strike that has taken out Suleimani has revealed this to an enormous degree. They don't care about how many American deaths are linked to that man. They don't realy care about the deaths of those people. They didn't know any of them. What they do know is that Trump was elected President against their wishes and they will join in solidarity with anyone no matter how vile or denounce any action no matter how justifiable if it will afford them a political opportunity. Democrats should be shown the door until they can demonstrate that they can get along and work with Americans who are not Democrats.

Iran has already stated this attack on our base was revenge for the killing of Solemani. Here we go.
