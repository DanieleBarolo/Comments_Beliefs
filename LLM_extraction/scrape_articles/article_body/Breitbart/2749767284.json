{"title": "Breitbart's Darby Announces Border Security and Public Corruption Tipline", "body": "HOUSTON, Texas — U.S. Border Patrol has been overwhelmed. The federal government is releasing thousands of illegal immigrants per week, the information Washington, D.C. shares about the border with the American people is often at odds with reality in the region, and scores of foreign children were found to be packed into holding cells on U.S. soil. Breitbart News has reported a near steady stream of Mexican cartel activity and criminal efforts across the U.S., reported on a plethora of corrupted U.S. officials and law enforcement along or near the U.S./Mexico border, and reported countless tales of human suffering due to an often wide open and unsecured border.Breitbart Texas is introducing a new tipline for Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, other law enforcement or other citizens to expose the reality of conditions along the U.S./Mexico border.“The new tipline is for law enforcement or anyone who wants to speak out on discrepancies between what Washington, D.C. is saying and what is actually occurring on the ground,” Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby said. “Whether you know of Mexican cartel related corruption occurring on U.S. soil, people or government officials helping traffic human beings, foreign children being kept in horrible conditions or being exploited, or simply feel the moral obligation to tell Americans what is really occurring in the region, this tipline is for you.”Darby recently publishedleaked imageswhich revealed immigrant children in overcrowded U.S. cells.“We are competent and we are able to handle and research these matters,” Darby said. “Anyone can call in or email with information and we will do all we can to investigate and get the word out.”The tipline number is 877-204-2033.Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby can be reached by email: bdarby@breitbart.comFollow Kristin Tate on Twitter@KristinBTateand Bob Price on Twitter@BobPriceBBTX.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/06/09/Breitbart-Texas-Announces-Border-Security-Tipline"}
