Rep. Wonders if GOP Are Robots Who Do Not Bleed or Feel

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
You need help understanding our opposition to ACA because it requires RATIONAL THOUGHT instead of knee jerk emotional response.

Also, your Glorious Leader's brilliant plan will STILL leave 30 million Americans without healthcare INSURANCE.

In addition, there were LOTS of serious, logical alternatives to ACA proposed, but they don't have the goal of CONTROLLING Americans, so they were dismissed by the Ostentatious Potentate and his minions.

This woman should just shut up. If this black, US Representative is what the black
community elected to represent them, it says a lot about them and their community.
Some of these government officials (Reid, Pelosi) do not contribute anything positive to improve our country and it's people. These people are nothing but JESTERS
and even at that, the entertainment they provide is of poor quality because they can
only speak in hyperbole but can't juggle apples. Let them expose what they truly are...
FOOLS!
