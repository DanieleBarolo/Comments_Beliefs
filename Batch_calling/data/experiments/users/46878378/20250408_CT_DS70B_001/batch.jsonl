Cronkite turned the American People against the war going on in Vietnam.  The Tet Offensive in 1968 was a decisive victory for the South Vietnamese government and its American support.  Cronkite with his commentary turned victory into an America defeat.  General Nguyen Giap the commander of the North Vietnamese communist military  in his memoir told of how at that point they had lost the war, but the actions of the Press back in America had given them time to recover from the losses.  There are tens of thousands of American names engraved on black granite slabs who might not have been there if Cronkite hadn't betrayed his country.  There are hundreds of thousands of we Veterans who know first hand the impact he had.  He is not looked upon with any respect.  The only people holding him in regard are those who continue his legacy..........\"fake news!\"\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMore lefty awards by lefty organizations to lefty people for doing/saying lefty things.

They claim that 'standard protocol' is for 'career State Dept professionals' to meet with Kim's underlings for months before nation's leaders should ever sit down together.  Plus, they accuse Trump of treating this as a TV reality show.\n\nI call BS.  Trump is taking what I consider may be sound business approach to diplomacy and nations' relations.  Who says Trump needs to negotiate anything in a first meeting.  There has NEVER been a meeting between our nation's leaders.  I see value in having a first meeting possibly for no reason other than to pave the way to a second and further meetings.  Maybe exchange key strategic goals.  But there's no need to get either side to make any commitments.  \n\nToo many deep state swamp creatures think things must be done the same way they've been done.  I voted for Trump because he doesn't.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhy is this lying, cheating wench still relevant on any stage?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It was decided that in the event of open hostilities, Gage should act preemptively to confiscate the munitions of the Rebel Whigs throughout the surrounding countryside.  \"\n\n\" After about an hour of meeting and refreshment, everybody concluded that Adams and Hancock should flee and that Concord should be warned that the British would probably attempt to capture the munitions stored there.  Dawes and Revere rode for Concord.  Along the way they met Samuel Prescott, who was on his way home from calling on his sweetheart.  Prescott, a known Whig, offered to assist the two riders, but before they got very far they were surprised by a British patrol. Prescott and Dawes escaped, but Revere was captured.

Again.\u2019\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nOMG, she speaks again!!!!\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation. A Grand Jury had been em-paneled. Governments from around the world had donated to the \u201cCharity\u201d. Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those \u201cDonations\u201d to the Clinton Foundation were declared. Guess who took over this investigation in 2002? None other than James Comey. Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS? Lois Lerner. This is all just a series of strange coincidences, right? Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005? None other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein. You Demoncrats are getting very quiet suddenly? Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this time frame? Robert Mueller. What do all four casting characters have in common? They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation. Fast forward to 2009. James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go to Lockheed Martin. Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, with her own personal email server. The Uranium One \u201cissue\u201d comes to the attention of the Hillary. She decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to no one other than, the Russians!! You would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn\u2019t, the American people got absolutely nothing out of it. However, prior to the sales approval, no one other than Arkansas Bill goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours. The FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme. Guess who was the FBI Director at this time? Robert Mueller. He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009. Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Maryland? Rod Rosenstein. Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved? ~145 million dollars in \u201cdonations\u201d made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal. Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division? None other than, Lois Lerner. Fast forward to 2015. Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 \u201cinvestigations\u201d the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that Hillary ran the State Department on an unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server. He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her \u201cPublic Service\u201d as Secretary of State which was required by law. He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email. Guess who became FBI Director in 2013? Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer. No one other than James Comey. Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the \u201cClinton Email Investigation\u201d after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner matter at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her. Nope, couldn\u2019t find any crimes there. Can you guess what happened next? In April 2016, James Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy. They didn\u2019t even convene a Grand Jury. Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true traitor he is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates Hillary from any wrongdoing. Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.
