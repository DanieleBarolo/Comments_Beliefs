It's pretty unfair to label someone as 'lazy' by throwing an entire clearing house at them and tell them to dig around to prove your point.

This study is a summary of other studies done from 1999-2014, none of which have shown that gun control has made so much as a dent in crime rates.  This study itself only discusses the effectiveness of keeping 'high risk individuals' from getting guns.  It says outright that this does not stop anyone from getting guns by other means.

It does not even address, much less conclude, that gun control measures actually reduce crime rates.  It actually says outright it does not answer the question.

From the abstract:
"Future research is needed to examine whether these laws curtail nonlethal gun violence and whether the effects of expanding prohibiting conditions for firearm possession are modified by the presence of policies to prevent [obtaining guns illegally]."

They are not even testing the laws' effectiveness on crime.  Just their ability to stop criminals from getting guns through the front door instead of the back door.

If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

If after decades of trying, and after thousands of laws passed across the US, why is there absolutely no curiosity as to the effects of these laws on crime?

  The CDC attempted to do those kind of reports, as they are the best equipped to assess them, but republicans put an end to that.

    Government funding isn't required to perform gun research.  Universities and individuals pump out 'new studies' almost every month.

No one is stopping Michael Bloomberg, for example, of spending millions on research, which he does, to show how gun control works, which would help his cause greatly.

But he doesn't do it.  Why not?

      Bloomberg has given so much money to John Hopkins School of Public Health, and funded so much research through their Center for Gun Policy and Research, that they named the school after him.

        And no reports showing the 'wild west' coming to fruition where gun control is dropped...no studies showing the positive results of gun control.

Where's the 'Everytown' billboard showing how much crime has dropped in New York, California, or Washington after these initiatives were passed...sometimes in the middle of the night 'because we can't lose one more life'?

          "No studies showing the positive results of gun control."

            Johns Hopkins is full of studies that simply say how bad things are.  There is not one study there that illustrates, using hard data, how crime trended upward after gun control was dropped.  And nothing there shows any place that had improved after passing gun control.
