All we\u2019re asking for is to sit down and have a discussion, reopen the government, and bring fairness to the American people under Obamacare.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut it all has to begin with a simple discussion.\u201dFor months, Democrats and the Obama administration haverefusedto negotiate with Republicans on a plan to raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling, which the nation will officially hit October 17.\u201cDemocrats are unwilling to bargain on the debt ceiling,\u201d top Democratic House Ways and Means Committee member Rep. Sandy Levin (D-MI)saidback in May.In August, Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lewsaid, \u201cThe president will not negotiate conditions on the debt limit.\u201dAnd on Thursday, Obama blasted Boehner, blaming him for the impasse andsayingthat Boehner had succumbed to the will of \u201cextremists in his party.\u201dBoehner fired back on Friday that he has always opposed a government shutdown and has sought a way to avert a debt ceiling crisis for months.\u201cI was opposed to shutting the government down\u2013that\u2019s no secret,\u201d said Boehner. \u201cI\u2019m opposed to defaulting on the debt\u2013that\u2019s no secret.\u201dOn Tuesday, Politicoreportedthat White House officials say \u201cObama doesn\u2019t see any reason to back off his hard-line position\u201d as long as the GOP seeks to negotiate ways to lessen the burdens of Obamacare on American families and workers.As the battle between Obama and Boehner intensifies, polls show voters are on the GOP\u2019s side in seeking spending cuts in exchange for a raising of the debt ceiling.\u00a0A Bloomberg poll found that61% of votersbelieve it is \u201cright to require spending cuts when the debt ceiling is raised even if it risks default.\u201d",
