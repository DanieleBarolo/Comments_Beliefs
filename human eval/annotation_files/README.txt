## Sheet Structure

- **Columns 1–3:**  
  **Identifiers**  
  - News Provider  
   - Article ID  
    - Comment ID  

- **Column 4:**  
  **NOTES**  
  - Use this column to write any thoughts, comments, or observations you have while classifying each comment.

- **Columns 5–64:**  
  **Topic Stance Annotation**  
  - Each column represents a specific topic.
  - For each topic, use the dropdown menu to select the stance present in the comment:
    - **e+**: Explicit positive stance
    - **e-**: Explicit negative stance
    - **i+**: Implicit positive stance
    - **i-**: Implicit negative stance
    - **0**: Topic is present, but no clear stance/target

- **Column 65:**  
  **Done? (Checkbox)**  
  - Tick the checkbox once you have finished annotating the row.
  - This will visually mark the row as completed.
  - **Note:** This does **not** lock the row or prevent further editing-it is only for your convenience.
