Judging from the vitriol and kneejerk reactions here, we have a long way to go.  I think the laws regarding liability for bars and sellers of alcohol are in a similar vein to what you are trying to achieve.  It is going to get worse before it gets better.  Keep the faith.  The one variable in all gun deaths that is always the same, there is a gun involved.  More guns are not the answer.  The NRA verges on a PLO style organization and the denial and mistruths propagated by them is dangerous.  Maybe a class action suit against Alex Jones?

Watching the recent US presidential campaign unfold, she said she was \u201cshocked by the exceptionally high bar put before one candidate and the exceptionally low bar put before the other candidate\u201d. \n\n\"It appeared much of the media got itself into knots trying to differentiate between balance, objectivity, neutrality, and crucially, truth. We cannot continue the old paradigm \u2013 let\u2019s say like over global warming, where 99.9% of the empirical scientific evidence is given equal play with the tiny minority of deniers,\" she said.\n\n\"And even truth-seeking journalists could easily be pressured into inadvertently or even intentionally covering stories in order to satisfy a false or imaginary sense of balance. The concept of \u201cbalance\u201d \u2013 or as its critics refer to it \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d \u2013 has long been a key precept of journalism.\"\n\n\"It epitomises the idealistic notion that journalists ought to be fair to all so that, whenever they write a story, they give equal weight to both sides of the argument. But, especially in our new \u201cpost-truth\u201d era, this doesn\u2019t always work to the benefit of the public good.\".... http://theconversation.com/why-journalistic-balance-is-failing-the-public-68783\n\nAnd in the era of Trumpism and the resurgence in white supremacist violence that it embodies, pretending to be \"fair and balanced\" only serves to undermine the people's right to know what's really going on. In this case, the MSM's attempts to equate left wing violence be a few dozen self-appointed \"defenders\" of those opposed to fascism, with the inbred violence of hard core nazis and klansmen is shameful in the extreme. \n\n<b>There is no equivalence.</b> But when the left resorts to violence, they provide the MSM and the Trumpian propagandists with all the fodder they need to create the illusion that there is, and even to pretend that ALL of the violence is coming from the left, even in the face of mountains of evidence to the contrary.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nDemonstrably false, as attested in the article and supported by my own extremely limited experience observing a PEGIDA rally & counter-protest here in London Ontario.  Stories of violence by \"leftists\" at these protests are overblown; in the main the protests are peaceful, but too often cameras skip those bits to get to the few juicy fights that crop up.  (London had 2 arrests in total; a 3Per got rambunctious in front of the cops, and later an Occupy organiser thought spitting on a bigot was a good idea.)\n\nAnd I'll point out that it's not leftists talking about mass expulsions of ethnic groups, nor the use of weapons prohibited by the Berne conventions, nor suggesting that police brutality is appropriate against opponents of the state.\n\n -- Steve\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nGuessing there are a lot of trolls on this story.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Frankly, I can't even begin to bring myself to worry about any scheme that Nunes plays the slightest part in cooking up, because Nunes has elaborately demonstrated to any observer's satisfaction that he is an almost impossibly stupid and bumbling moron. Setting him to work for you is tantamount to tasking Louis Gohmert with watching your back.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n423 days until the next election that will surely be targeted again by the same army of Russian operatives who interfered in 2016, and the republicans are still obstructing and sabotaging the most important investigation since the 9/11 Commission into the most damaging espionage operation ever mounted against the United States.\n\nThat's more than \"just\" hyper-partisan cowardice. That's <u>treason</u>. But you know with 100% certainty that the vast majority of brain-dead Trumpian headbangers think Nunes and company are all patriots protecting their Dear Leader from Barack Obama's Deep State agents and the malevolent MSM who want to destroy his presidency and put Uday, Qusay and Jerry-K in adjoining cells.\n\nWhat Trump and his minions are setting up is the kind of violent mindset that can fuel a large scale insurrection if/when he's charged/impeached. He'd rather see America burn to the ground than admit his lies and answer for his crimes. That makes him the most dangerously deranged man on Earth and a coward of historic proportions.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nand Nixon...\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You don't see or hear Sessions or Trump going after them do you??? It comes down to the 2 things that matter to Republicans. Skin color and culture. The Us has had more than one great waves of immigration since its conception. It was mainly white men and women up until the end of the 19th century. After slavery was abolished they needed a new source of cheap labor. Chinese immigrants filled that position. This is also when the laws and regulations regarding immigration began to change. Hispanics only make up about 50 percent of modern immigration. 20 percent of immigrants are European. Why do we never hear of these European immigrants??? The United States had free and open immigration up until the end of the 19th century. This is when persons of color outnumbered WHITE people entering the country. They have enacted many laws and restrictions on immigration since this time. There weren't all of these laws and rules when your ancestors likely came here. The only reason that you are an American is because you are born here. You don't hear white children of immigrants referred to as \"anchor babies\". Republicans make up lie after lie about immigrants and the impact they have on our country. 70 percent of Americans don't know basic facts about their own country.

You don't see or hear Sessions or Trump going after them do you??? It comes down to the 2 things that matter to Republicans. Skin color and culture. The Us has had more than one great waves of immigration since its conception. It was mainly white men and women up until the end of the 19th century. After slavery was abolished they needed a new source of cheap labor. Chinese immigrants filled that position. This is also when the laws and regulations regarding immigration began to change. Hispanics only make up about 50 percent of modern immigration. 20 percent of immigrants are European. Why do we never hear of these European immigrants??? The United States had free and open immigration up until the end of the 19th century. This is when persons of color outnumbered WHITE people entering the country. They have enacted many laws and restrictions on immigration since this time. There weren't all of these laws and rules when your ancestors likely came here. The only reason that you are an American is because you are born here. You don't hear white children of immigrants referred to as \"anchor babies\". Republicans make up lie after lie about immigrants and the impact they have on our country. 70 percent of Americans don't know basic facts about their own country. They walk around blissfully ignorant just because they are born here. If we were fair we would give everyone a test. But then most of the white people that have been here for generations would be booted to the curb!!!!\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhy do you want to flood our nation with low skilled illegal immigrants?

Getting arrested for free speech from a wheelchair bound individual is despicable. What threat did they pose? It's deplorables like Cassidy and Graham who would deny disabled people access to healthcare, while, at the same time, getting theirs for free. What a bunch of hypocrites. It's OK to ignore the rights of free speech guaranteed by the first amendment, for those that are not white,  not independently wealthy, disabled, anyone who does not meet republican standards, yet it's OK with them to allow white supremacists to spew their outright hatred, which resulted in the brutal murder of a young woman in Charlottesville?

Because instead, it builds dystopia. \n\"How can we live without our cell phone towers?\" The same way people lived before there were any, only a few decades ago--better.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI guess I'm missing the part where this is \"a good news story\".\n\nIt's like the Trumpians just blurt out the first damn thing that pops into their punkin' heads because it makes them look good and covers their asses without considering what it is they're really saying, who they're going to piss off by saying it and how obvious it is that they're lying.\n\nYou know, like children.\nOnly children are usually a whole lot kinder.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnd they don't get their news from Alex Jones.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They're one and the same, and their perverse, decades-long, embrace will continue to incite fear, loathing, sedition and slaughter until the day, God-only-knows when, that even the most stubborn \"conservatives\" will have had enough of the firearms industry's meddling in our democratic process and the GOP's complicity in maintaining the gun monger stranglehold on the creation of new legislation.\n\nSadly that day won't come on Monday, March 5, or any other day in 2018, or 2019 or 2020. In fact, support for gun control will remain a Great Howling Talking Point for the republicans for years to come that will help them shoot down democratic candidates and ward off the inexorable demographic shift that's eating away at their power. \n\nIt's hard to imagine what might change that, since the massacres at Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Orlando, Las Vegas, Southerland Springs and Parkland didn't move the republicans to allow even the most common sense legislation to pass, like Universal Background Checks, limits on large capacity magazines or even bump stocks. \n\nAs a gun owner for more than 35 years, I'm ashamed of this petulance and cowardice by those who support gun ownership as I do, but seem to have no problem with the ownership of our government by the firearms industry.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nImagine if they really did tackle our mental health system 20 years ago?

Putin would love a protracted conflict in Syria and the Ukraine and makes money off of NK slave labor.  War always bolsters the executive.  Always.  If an executive wants to bomb people you can bet it is to bolster support at home.  If Congress moves to war it may be different.  May be.

WHY?\n\nI know that is not what it means but the wording just touched my funny bone.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nthe problem with American wages isn't caused by immigrants, legal or not.....it is caused by greed. The top employees at Walmart make over 1100 times the amount that the median employees earn. If Walmart paid their employees a living wage and stopped cutting the number of people they employ it would do a lot to help American workers.\n\nNo matter how many self check-outs they install, I will stop shopping for anything I don't absolutely have to have before I will work to help put American workers out of a job. And I only order online when there is no way I can get what I want locally. Walmart could operate their chain for non-profit and they still would not run out of money for themselves and their families.\n\nIf Sessions is really worried about American wages and jobs......raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Give tax breaks to companies for each US worker they hire and pay a living wage.....end some of the other tax breaks to make this one more interesting to them.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhat is the brunt of immigration?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They include<b>:</b>\n\n(1) Article III of the Geneva Conventions ratified by 196 nations, \n\n(2) The UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 5,\n\n(3) Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified by 153 countries in 1992, \n\n(4) The Convention against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ratified by 136 countries  in 1994.\n\nAnd then there's the part where both the military and the intelligence agencies say torture doesn't work. which Donald Trump replied to by saying \"I don't care what anybody says, it (torture) has saved lives.\"\n\n(1) Army Field Manual 34-52 Chapter 1 says: \u201c.....the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear.\u201d\n\n(2) The C.I.A.\u2019s 1963 interrogation manual stated: Intense pain is quite likely to produce false confessions, concocted as a means of escaping from distress\"\n\n(3) According to a 2014 Washington Post article, Michael Sulick, former head of the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Service \u2013 said that the spy agency has seen no fall-off in intelligence since waterboarding was banned by the Obama administration. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve suffered at all from an intelligence standpoint.\u201d \nhttp://www.washingtonsblog.com...\n\nSo he couldn't \"change the laws\". The U.S. would have to abandon all the treaties including the Geneva Conventions, and that would make America an international pariah. Unfortunately, pariahhood seems to be one of Trump's goals. Seems that he considers it nothing more than political incorrectness that he can fix with a tweet if necessary.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe CIA won't admit to any wrong doing on her part now do you think they were giving a lot of information out about it?

The Ds and Rs have been using their 'religious' bs to deprive ''we, the people'' of our basic rights for a lot longer than anyone alive has been alive.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nSo let me get this straight, women are the gatekeepers of sex but they are also supposed to be submissive to men?  Well, that's awfully convenient isn't it? \n\nI think from now on, the people in charge of the vaults at all the banks ought to be submissive to me. Pretty sure God said so. They get to look after other people's money and make sure it stays safe, but when <b>I</b> come asking to get in there, they have a religious responsibility to do as I say.  (Oh, and did I mention that I am extremely greedy and can't control my impulses to take other people's money?)  But you know, if I actually succeed in stealing that money, it's totally the vault keeper's fault for not telling me \"no.\" Even though I just told them they can't tell me \"no.\" Because God. \n\nI'm gonna be rich.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAs other readers have pointed out, you cannot reconcile the idea that women should submit with any understanding of human behavior.

I really dispute the term \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d, it should be \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d. \u201cWhite nationalist\u201d makes it sound like they are patriotic people who just happen to be white. \u201cWhite supremacist\u201d indicates the truth about them being racists who think the white race ought to reign supreme over all others. Or better yet, just use the word \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d, it gets the point across pretty well. Identity Evropa is a neo-Nazi group and Richard Spencer is an open neo-Nazi so this guy James Allsup is definitely a neo-Nazi. Not just a white supremacist but a true Hitler-loving fascist. When the neo-Nazis were marching at Charlottesville and yelling out in unison \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d while holding their torches, pretty obvious they were neo-Nazis, only a total dishonest political hack like Donald Trump would deny the obvious here.\n\nAnd to be clear, while it is not illegal to be a neo-Nazi in the United States, any business that employs one needs to be picketed and boycotted until they fire the neo-Nazi employee, we need to make it impossible for neo-Nazis to earn any sort of living, cut off their money supply. It is perfectly legal for us to do this, there is no law against boycotts or protests. If neo-Nazis realize that it is impossible for them to openly be neo-Nazi and have any sort of life, and that to survive and have a job they need to stop being neo-Nazis, that will be the end of that. Even if being chronically unemployed due to this led to them somehow getting some form of government benefits for the poor, this would still drastically reduce their purchasing power and ability to afford transportation to nationwide protests organized by their movement, in fact poor people have a hard time even getting around the towns they live in much less the country. So that would put an end to their stupid protests since protests cost money.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNot surprising.

I think that is the mindset that the poor and working class of the world have been handed is that; if they are ill it is somehow their fault .  The economic reality is that low-cost preventative care and managed care for chronic conditions saves everyone money.  It is really a matter of not wanting to share.  I think the healthcare debate is a rural urban skin color culture thing and not even a money thing.

Any time any issues comes up around sex, I keep seeing Santorum say that intercourse can only be used for procreation.....and then see conservatives try to take health care away. I think in some twisted way, they may want to see people suffer because they have sex to begin with. \n\nAnd in some ways, I think it might be a widespread problem that Americans really think that sex is a naughty thing. Think about how often sex gets linked to anything bad, cocksuc-er, fuc-er, blowing somebody, dick, c-nt,....slut, and so on, we link sex with being bad so often and I wish someone did a study on it to find out how to change it or why we do it. Sex should be loving, wild, fun,and a mixture of other emotions. It is within the normal range of past time of humans. Mixing it with something dirty may even help fuel conservatives to recoil at the thought of sex being acted on for other reason other than procreation.....might be one reason so many get caught up in sex scandals.They may think they have to hide those feelings. With Santorum though, I suspect he just doesn't care much about women....\n\nAt any rate, I hate to see any woman being discriminated against and live in so much stress. Some I feel may be due to the level of past discrimination that it gets passed on to the children by family stories. I am not saying that blacks don't live that today because we all know what happened to Trayvon Martin, just saying it happened so much in the past it may be expected to happen all the time.

Serbs were bombed because they were doing things that make isis look like humanitarians. Loyal allies during WW2? well firstly ww2 is long over many things happened since then and I don\u2019t know about loyal allies since serbs fought on both sides and had their own sinister goals, they \u201csaved\u201d a few american pilots for political reasons and that gives serbs today the right to murder, rape and torture civilians? That part of \u201cyour\u201d territory was confiscated after you tried to create a \u201cgreater\u201d country using the above mentioned methods. Also I love how you throw the \u201cmuslim\u201d word around to appeal to bigots, as far as mafia goes serbs made mafias look like charity workers. You call them mafia because they don\u2019t bow to you. Enough of this serbian no guilt no responsibility propaganda.

Any time any issues comes up around sex, I keep seeing Santorum say that intercourse can only be used for procreation.....and then see conservatives try to take health care away. I think in some twisted way, they may want to see people suffer because they have sex to begin with. \n\nAnd in some ways, I think it might be a widespread problem that Americans really think that sex is a naughty thing. Think about how often sex gets linked to anything bad, cocksuc-er, fuc-er, blowing somebody, dick, c-nt,....slut, and so on, we link sex with being bad so often and I wish someone did a study on it to find out how to change it or why we do it. Sex should be loving, wild, fun,and a mixture of other emotions. It is within the normal range of past time of humans. Mixing it with something dirty may even help fuel conservatives to recoil at the thought of sex being acted on for other reason other than procreation.....might be one reason so many get caught up in sex scandals.They may think they have to hide those feelings. With Santorum though, I suspect he just doesn't care much about women....\n\nAt any rate, I hate to see any woman being discriminated against and live in so much stress. Some I feel may be due to the level of past discrimination that it gets passed on to the children by family stories. I am not saying that blacks don't live that today because we all know what happened to Trayvon Martin, just saying it happened so much in the past it may be expected to happen all the time. And that is very sad. All of it is so sad.

Thank God for the person/s who wrote that op ed about the chaos and worry they have with Trump's stupid, childish and dangerous behavior. Although they are not really telling us with common sense who didn't vote for the idiot anything new. We knew he was unfit, mentally unstable and has no business holding the highest office in the land.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnother take on this:\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/9/6/1793780/-Sen-Harris-corners-Kavanaugh-and-then-implies-she-s-got-bombshell-evidence-against-him?detail=emaildkre\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I do not agree.  Trump firing Sessions would be a good thing.  It would be a good thing for immigrants.  It would be a good thing for minorities.  It would be a good thing for everybody that are not rich, white, conservatives.\n\nWe need to deal with one issue at a time.  For example, Tillerson was the worst Secretary of State in recent memory.  While I disagree with probably everything that Pompeo believes, he is at least competent (such a low bar).  I believe the same for Sessions.  He is a racist SOB who does not believe that women or minorities have any rights.  Eff him.  Whoever Trump replaces him with may be worse or may be better.  We can go after them once they are nominated.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nJeff Sessions was the most unrepentant bigot in the Senate, and his appointment and subsequent confirmation as Attorney General is an ongoing obscenity. His monstrous family separation policy was the product of his bigotry that served no public good. Sessions not only needs to be removed from office, he needs to be charged with multiple felonies for child endangerment.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt is not reckless and unwise.  Leaving women to die in places we, Americans, have helped brutalize is reckless and unwise.  Jeff Sessions is not concerned with human rights,  he is concerned with punishing brown people.  Stop apologizing for this shit.  The US can absorb lots of things, what do you know?  Don't you live in Saudi Arabia?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

As author Jody Raphael reveals in Rape Is Rape, the more acquaintance rape is reported and taken seriously by prosecutors, judges, and juries, the louder the clamor of rape denial becomes.\n\nThrough firsthand interviews with victims, medical and judicial records, social media analysis, and statistics from government agencies, Rape Is Rape exposes the tactics used by the deniers, a group that includes conservatives and right-wing Christians as well as some controversial feminists. The personal stories of young acquaintance rape victims whom Raphael interviewed demonstrate how assaults on their credibility, buttressed by claims of low prevalence, prevent many from holding their rapists accountable, enabling them to rape others with impunity. Rape Is Rape is an expos\u00e9 of those using rape denial to further their political agendas, and it is a call to action to protect the rights of women and girls, making it safe for victims to come forward, and end the acquaintance rape crisis. A resources section is included for those seeking help, advice, or hoping to get involved.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

The right would portray the allegations as a coordinated effort, which they don't seem to be.  They also latch onto the Swetnick allegation as if that one is so far in left field as to be insane.  Kavanaugh does not have to be a sick monster gang banger to have knowingly participated in such endeavors.  It is not that far fetched to imagine him at a party where something really bad was going on.  The pressure to have sex is very powerful in high school.  It is absolutely common for boys to try to get girls drunk to have sex.  I doubt we will get any strong evidence of this allegation but they hyperbolate everything so they can then marginalize it.  Desperate times call for desperate measures I guess.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

The feeling is that kids will come, do well in college, and do internships there while going to school and then the best and brightest will end up staying in that nation, improving that country over ours.\n\nMost of our Nobel Peace prizes have gone to people who were born and educated in foreign nations. I think it is time we try to do some brain draining ourselves. Encourage all of the people here to be educated.\n\nUnder the first GI Bill, for every dollar we spent on education we made a $6 profit. And the end result was an educated population. THEY raised our standard of living and made us the envy around the world.\n\nThis woman may know far more then you do apparently on the benefits of  an educated people. they work and pay taxes too. Also, with an education one usually makes more money than someone without an education. With their salary they can afford their own home and car if they want one. She didn't ask for them to get those things for free, that is hyperbole and spin you are forced to use to try to fool the people on the thread.\n\nI hope you note that I didn't need to find a cleaver way to say what an idiot you are using this persona. I just provided some fact and logic to show that you don't know what you are saying.

There is no reasoning with the cult of the Republican party base.  There are plenty of non-voters to win elections.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nseveral nations are willing to give college educations to foreign kids....they are using that as a means to brain drain. The feeling is that kids will come, do well in college, and do internships there while going to school and then the best and brightest will end up staying in that nation, improving that country over ours.\n\nMost of our Nobel Peace prizes have gone to people who were born and educated in foreign nations. I think it is time we try to do some brain draining ourselves. Encourage all of the people here to be educated.\n\nUnder the first GI Bill, for every dollar we spent on education we made a $6 profit. And the end result was an educated population. THEY raised our standard of living and made us the envy around the world.\n\nThis woman may know far more then you do apparently on the benefits of  an educated people. they work and pay taxes too. Also, with an education one usually makes more money than someone without an education. With their salary they can afford their own home and car if they want one. She didn't ask for them to get those things for free, that is hyperbole and spin you are forced to use to try to fool the people on the thread.\n\nI hope you note that I didn't need to find a cleaver way to say what an idiot you are using this persona. I just provided some fact and logic to show that you don't know what you are saying.

You have no idea what the ten year old Rahmstorf paper is about.  Rahmstorf is rebutting noted denialist, Richard Lindzen.  The passage you attempt to twist is saying that if you limit climate forcings exclusively to CO2, a doubling of CO2 would lead to 1C global temperature increase.  But, that's meaningless because, for instance, water vapor exists.  And we've increased CO2 by just 45% so far and we're already 1C hotter than pre-industrial times.  What say you, NASA? <i>With latest update from @NASAGISS, 2018 is almost guaranteed to be the 4th warmest year in the record, and likely to be (~76%) the 4th year in a row more than 1\u00baC above the late 19th Century. (1\u00baC = 1.8\u00baF ~ \u00bc of an ice age unit)</i>\n\n2. Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is complicated which is why denialists think it helps them.  A recent paper tells us the ECS is likely between 2.4oC and 4.5oC (17-83% confidence interval), with a mode of 2.9oC and a median of 3.3oC. https://eartharxiv.org/4et67/.\n\n3. There is nothing in the abstract you link to which supports your statement.  And, the models and observed temperatures are quite close. https://twitter.com/ClimateOfGavin\n\n4.  Not sure what you think you're gleaning from an interview Jones did in 2010.  Maybe if you waved your hands harder.\n\n5.  The old, \"it's natural\" argument.  Jesus, we need a better class of denier round these parts.  Let's just look at your own cites, shall we?  \"The first and crucial piece of evidence is, of course, that the magnitude of the warming is what is expected from the anthropogenic perturbation of the radiation balance, so anthropogenic forcing is able to explain all of the temperature rise.... The second important piece of evidence is clear: there is no viable alternative explanation. <i>In the scientific literature, no serious alternative hypothesis has been proposed to explain the observed global warming. Other possible causes, such as solar activity, volcanic activity, cosmic rays, or orbital cycles, are well observed, but they do not show trends capable of explaining the observed warming.</i>\" Rahmstorf at p. 47.  \n\nIt is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. {10.3} <i>IPCC AR5, Summary for Policy Makers, D.3 Detection and Attribution of Climate Change at p. 15.</i>\n\nBut, what does extrememly likely even mean?  It means greater than 95% confidence.  Dr Gavin Schmidt explained that the IPCC\u2019s implied best guess was that humans were responsible for around  <i>110% of observed warming</i> (ranging from 72% to 146%), with natural factors in isolation leading to a slight cooling over the past 50 years. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-scientists-think-100-of-global-warming-is-due-to-humans\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nRoscoe.

Nor would it account for the increased instances of filibustering in each session of Congress even as the total number of bills passed (and introduced) has declined.  Or the open purge of Moderate and Liberal Republicans from the party since the Civil Rights era.\n\nFor the purpose of this discussion we can focus simply on the intent of various laws ranging from equal pay to collective bargaining.  The right straightforwardly opposes any such measures since they represented an opening of the political system and in turn, an obstacle to the maintenance of a free market.\n\nEven taking into account the sizeable rightward shift by the Democratic party over the same period, successive administrations have still moved the needle on say, the poverty or uninsured rate.\n\nThere was a postwar consensus that broke down permanently in 1973.   It's really that simple.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI think it wasn't partisan as much as it was skin color and religion.

Now, decades later  I feel mentally fine and am grooving on retirement. Just bought an old sailboat for \u20ac500 and can't wait for summer. I sailed last summer in an open dingy to relearn how. If someone would have told me 25 years ago that I would be this psyched up for life, I would have never have believed it. \nThank-you state-run, single-payer medical care & insurance for prioritizing me over corporate profit. I willing pay my taxes, because we citizens comprise the nation, we should take care of each other first, and in America, people are treated as disposable consumer units. \nFuck that! I am forever glad & grateful to have fallen in love with a European who got me out of that ratrace.\nI dearly wish all of you back there get Medicare for all soon, and I do what I can to let my Congress Critters know, but they are Troglodytic Kansas Republicans, so it's like talking to tree strumps.

Google puts on a good face (no pun intended), but then doesn't protect the data that they collect and continues to work with authoritarian countries (China) to subvert Democracy.\n\nAnd then there is Facebook.  Through incompetence (purposeful and not), they have continuously disregarded user safeguards and then act surprised when they get caught.  I would almost say that they are evil.\n\nThe one that is left off of the list is Apple.  They continue to try and protect people's data (we can argue as to why they are doing it - is it because its the right thing to do or a sales pitch?).  But I would argue their continued use of questionable companies like FoxConn (sp) to make their products does bring me pause.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nApple should be applauded for this, and not be afraid to go further by removing their apps completely if it continues. Also not the worst time for Apple to launch their own ad free version of FB/IG. They are probably the only company that could pull it off.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nA book can explode a thousand times but the internet never sleeps.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

(The Washington Post)\n\nBy Matt Zapotosky ,\nKaroun Demirjian and\nRosalind S. Helderman February 27 at 9:25 AM\nMichael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former fixer and personal lawyer, returns to Capitol Hill Wednesday for public testimony before the House Oversight Committee in what is expected to be a compelling appearance.\n\nCohen will allege \u2014 amid a stream of potentially damaging revelations about the president \u2014 that Trump knew in advance that the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks planned to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails, and he will describe the president as a \u201cracist,\u201d a \u201cconman\u201d and a \u201ccheat,\u201d according to a copy of his written testimony.\n\nThe testimony was first obtained by Politico and confirmed as authentic to The Washington Post by a person familiar with it.\n\nThe WikiLeaks allegation is perhaps the most explosive in the written testimony, speaking to the core of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the election. Mueller already has alleged that Russian military officials hacked the emails before they were published online by groups including WikiLeaks.\n\nAccording to the prepared testimony, Cohen will say he listened in as Trump confidant Roger Stone told the then-presidential candidate in July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, that \u201che had just gotten off the phone with [WikiLeaks founder] Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d It was in those days that WikiLeaks released a batch of DNC emails. Trump has previously denied talking about WikiLeaks with Stone.\n\nCohen is also expected to provide evidence of how Trump, as president, personally signed a check reimbursing his then-lawyer for money Cohen paid a woman to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen already has admitted that the payment, which he made at Trump\u2019s direction as the presidential campaign was nearing its end, violated campaign finance laws, and his supporters believe the check is evidence that the criminal scheme extended into Trump\u2019s time in office.\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, wrote in a text message to The Washington Post responding to Cohen\u2019s prepared testimony: \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic. .\u2009.\u2009. If you believe him, you are a fool.\u201d Trump tweeted early Wednesday: \u201cMichael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked\u2019s lawyer!\u201d He did not respond to a shouted question as he began his meeting in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kimg Jong Un.\n\nFollow along with our live coverage here throughout the day. The hearing begins at 10 a.m.\n\n9:18 a.m.: Evidence of yet another portrait Trump bought of himself\n\nAccording to written testimony distributed in advance, Cohen will allege that Trump asked him to arrange for purchase of a large portrait of Trump himself for $60,000 \u2014 and that Trump then repaid the bidder with money from Trump\u2019s own charitable foundation. Trump kept the art for himself.\n\nThe Post has previously reported about two portraits of himself that Trump bought with money from his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. This appears to be a third.\n\nCohen\u2019s description matches news reports about a 2013 art auction in New York\u2019s Hamptons, in which a Trump friend named Stewart Rahr bought a nine-foot-tall portrait of Trump from artist William Quigley. The Hamptons news site Dan\u2019s Papers quoted Quigley then as saying the payment was $67,000, and that he picked the check up from Trump himself.\n\nIf Cohen\u2019s account is true, the payment to Rahr was not mentioned in the Trump Foundation\u2019s IRS filings for 2013. Those filings show only on $60,000 payment from the Trump Foundation, but that was listed as going to the American Cancer Society.\n\nRahr, Quigley and the American Cancer Society all declined to comment while The Post was reporting on Trump\u2019s charitable giving in 2016.\n\nThe New York Attorney General last year sued Trump and his foundation, alleging the charity engaged in \u201cpersistently illegal conduct.\u201d Among the allegations: Trump used charity funds to pay for two other portraits of himself. Tax law prohibits charity leaders from using nonprofit assets to buy things for themselves. In December 2018, Trump agreed that charity would be shut down.\n\n8:00 a.m.: Cohen alleges Trump knew in advance of WikiLeaks email dump\n\nPotentially the most explosive allegation that Cohen is expected to make is that Trump knew in advance of WikiLeaks\u2019 July 2016 release of DNC emails. According to Cohen\u2019s written testimony, he will say he was in Trump\u2019s office that month when Trump\u2019s secretary put Stone on the line, and Stone described what was about to happen.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u2018wouldn\u2019t that be great,\u2019\u201d Cohen will say, according to his written remarks.\n\nMueller has investigated extensively Stone\u2019s dealings, or attempted dealings, with WikiLeaks, and at Cohen\u2019s sentencing hearing, Jeannie Rhee, part of Mueller\u2019s prosecution team, told the judge that Cohen had provided \u201ccredible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues under investigation.\u201d The revelation Wednesday may offer a glimpse into what he might have shared with the special counsel.\n\nWhile Mueller\u2019s prosecutors have charged Stone with lying to Congress about his efforts to reach WikiLeaks, they have not alleged he criminally conspired with the group or with Russia to influence the outcome of the election.\n\nIn June 2016, Assange had talked publicly about having acquired damaging information on Clinton.\n\nWikiLeaks and Assange have said they never communicated with Stone, though during the campaign, Stone privately told associates that he was in contact with Assange, and that WikiLeaks had material that would be damaging to Clinton. In August 2016, he also boasted publicly of having communicated with Assange and \u2014 perhaps most notably \u2014 tweeted on Aug. 21: \u201cTrust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201d Six weeks later, WikiLeaks began posting another set of stolen emails from the account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta.\n\n\nA person familiar with Cohen\u2019s testimony said Cohen does not have evidence, such as contemporaneous memos, to support the assertion he will make about the phone call between Stone and Trump.\n\nIn response to the testimony, WikiLeaks tweeted that the group \u201chad already publicly announced its pending publications and has always denied speaking to Roger Stone.\u201d\n\n7:45 a.m. A check signed by Trump, and another signed by his son\n\nPeople familiar with Cohen\u2019s testimony had in recent days touted that he would release evidence connecting Trump to possible criminal conduct while in office. His written testimony makes clear what that evidence is.\n\nCohen will provide a copy of a $35,000 check that he says was personally signed by Trump on Aug. 1, 2017, to reimburse him for paying off Stormy Daniels, an adult-film actress who had alleged having an affair with Trump. Cohen has admitted that \u2014 at Trump\u2019s direction \u2014 he paid the woman $130,000 in the waning days of the campaign so she would keep quiet about the affair, a payment that violated campaign finance laws.\n\nAccording to his written testimony, Cohen will effectively use the check to allege that the criminal wrongdoing in which he has implicated the president continued even after Trump took office.\n\n\u201cI am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on August 1, 2017 \u2014 when he was President of the United States \u2014 pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me \u2014 the word used by Mr. Trump\u2019s TV lawyer \u2014 for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year \u2014 while he was President,\u201d Cohen will say, according to his written remarks.\n\nCohen will also display a second $35,000 check, dated March 17, 2017, this one signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Trump organization chief operating officer Allen Weisselberg, a person familiar with his testimony said. The check offers the first evidence that the president\u2019s son may also have been involved with the reimbursement scheme.\n\n\nGiuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, has previously acknowledged Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payments, though he has disputed the president violated campaign finance laws. He has also said, though, that he did not know when the president learned the nature of the payment to Daniels and that he only learned the full details after law enforcement raided Cohen\u2019s home in April.\n\nWhile it already had been clear that Cohen was implicating Trump in the campaign finance violations to which he pleaded guilty, his assertion that Trump was involved in a \u201ccover-up\u201d while president \u2014 backed by a check with Trump\u2019s writing on it \u2014 will be notable. Cohen will also allege that in February 2017, one month into his presidency, Trump assured him in the Oval Office that the reimbursement checks were on their way.\n\n[The details of what Michael Cohen has admitted previously about the hush money payments]\n\n7:30 a.m.: \u2018He is a racist, he is a conman, he is a cheat\u2019\n\nOne of the notable aspects of Cohen\u2019s testimony is the extent to which he will air what he says are the president\u2019s personal and moral failings. According to his written remarks, he will call the president a \u201cracist,\u201d a \u201cconman\u201d and a \u201ccheat,\u201d and describe personal anecdotes to back up his assertions.\n\n\u201cWhile we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way,\u201d Cohen will say, according to his written testimony. \u201cAnd, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.\u201d\n\nCohen already had detailed those anecdotes in an interview with Vanity Fair in November, though his describing them again in a public setting could be politically damaging for the president. He will also allege other, petty actions he says the president took, including directing him \u201cto threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.\u201d\n\n7:15 a.m.: On the eve of the hearing, a personal attack\n\nIn a sign of just how nasty the hearing will become, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) tweeted a lurid attack on Cohen on Tuesday alleging \u2014 without providing evidence \u2014 that he had affairs.\n\n\u201cDo your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot...\u201d Gaetz tweeted.\n\nTrump and his defenders have relentlessly attacked Cohen ever since he agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with law enforcement, with the president even suggesting that Cohen\u2019s own father-in-law should be investigated. But even in that context, Gaetz\u2019s tweet was remarkably personal, foreshadowing what is likely be several days of blistering attacks on Cohen\u2019s credibility. Before the night was out, he would apologize in a second tweet.\n\n\u201cWhile it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I\u2019m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he wrote.\n\nLanny J. Davis, an attorney for Cohen, said of Gaetz\u2019s comment: \u201cWe will not respond to Mr. Gaetz\u2019s despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct. I also trust that his constituents will not appreciate that their congressman has set a new low \u2014 which in today\u2019s political culture is hard to imagine as possible.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had said in a statement, \u201cDisgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements. Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\u201d\n\n7:00 a.m.: What will Cohen say about the controversial BuzzFeed story?\n\nLast month, BuzzFeed News leveled the explosive allegation that Cohen had claimed the president directed him to lie to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow, and that he had told the special counsel as much. The special counsel\u2019s office soon disputed that report. But Cohen had never addressed it publicly \u2014 until now.\n\nAccording to his written testimony, Cohen will tell lawmakers, \u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates.\u201d That would seem to refute BuzzFeed\u2019s report, which alleged \u201cthe president personally instructed him to lie \u2014 by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did \u2014 in order to obscure Trump\u2019s involvement.\u201d\n\nThe testimony is not totally surprising. If Cohen said BuzzFeed was right, that would raise significant questions about the credibility of the special counsel\u2019s office, which issued a rare public statement taking aim at the news outlet\u2019s reporting.\n\nCohen will offer, according to his written testimony, that he felt Trump was sending him an implicit message he should lie \u2014 though he seemed to intuit that message from interactions he had with Trump many months before he testified, while Trump was still a candidate and the Trump Tower Moscow project was still being pursued.\n\n\u201cTo be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too \u2014 because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.\u201d\n\nThat should be little solace to BuzzFeed, as it was all mostly public at the time it published its story. In court documents, Cohen\u2019s lawyers had said previously his lies \u201csprung regrettably from Michael\u2019s effort, as a loyal ally and then-champion\u201d of Trump. They also noted when he prepared his testimony, he was \u201cin close and regular contact with White House-based staff and legal counsel\u201d to Trump.\n\n6:45 a.m.: Cohen will present Trump financial records\n\nCohen is expected to present to lawmakers some Trump financial records \u2014 including three years of financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank, according to his written testimony. He will allege that Trump \u201cinflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\u201d\n\nThat testimony could be particularly grating for the president, who has bristled in particular at the notion that his and his family\u2019s finances might be subjected to congressional or law enforcement scrutiny.\n\nDavid A.

The Post notes, \u201cAmong Fox Corp.\u2019s first acts in business: appointing former House speaker Paul D. Ryan to its board of directors.\u201d\n\nNow, as House speaker, Ryan wasn\u2019t one to stand up to Trump. To the contrary, Ryan excused Trump\u2019s behavior and enabled his presidency, only rarely speaking out of school. But maybe this is his chance at redemption. Along with Murdoch, Ryan might make up for the damage he did to the United States by refashioning Fox News from an RT clone into a real news operation. He might actually insist that journalistic standards be upheld by everyone who goes on air. A pipe dream? Probably. Ryan\u2019s hardly a profile in courage. However, if Murdoch ever wants to escape from his father Rupert Murdoch\u2019s shadow, he\u2019ll have to do something more impressive than erecting a state TV operation to enable the most dishonest and authoritarian-minded president in American history. He\u2019d have to do something truly patriotic for the country that made him a multimillionaire \u2014 put country above profits and decency over cynicism.\"\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/20/trump-cant-afford-lose-his-state-tv/?utm_term=.e9da1ca673da\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

We've interfered with the elections of lots of other countries, so it's okay when someone does it back to us (as long as it helps a Republican win, of course - otherwise it's librocommiefascism!)\n\nAnd even if it did happen, and even if people from President T's inner circle shared polling and demographic data with the Russians, that's not collusion.  And even if it is, collusion isn't a crime anyway (unless it's done by CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, who totes colluded by the way, and should be locked up).\n\nAnd anyway, the Mueller report TOTALLY EXONERATED President T of any and all wrongdoing, so it would be pointless for the Dems to subpoena the report anyway.

They benefited from the attack, and could later claim Obama didn't do enough, even though they made it impossible for him to actually do so).\n\nWith friends like Republicans, we don't need enemas.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWho is president now?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
