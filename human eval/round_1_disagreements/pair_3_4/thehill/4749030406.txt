The cult can try to warmonger and lie about Democrats supporting Iran all they want. Simple fact is the vast majority of Americans do not support war with Iran. It's wildly unpopular, with bipartisan opposition. 

So go ahead and revert back to the neo-cons we knew you were. You will drown on the sinking ship with your idiot in chief.

Iran has already stated this attack on our base was revenge for the killing of Solemani. Here we go.
