There's a reason Guiliani and Powell are laying out their case in a press conference instead of a courtroom.

PARENT COMMENT:
"Wayne County canvassers doxxed and threatened over votes, Detroit Free Press", November 18, 2020


"After Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers first 
refused to certify the results of the election, Twitter users spammed 
the site with their names, personal details and links to their social 
media pages. 



The goal appeared to be to create offline consequences for 
the two Republican board members, Chairperson Monica Palmer and William 
Hartmann. People scrutinized Hartmann's Facebook posts going back to 2013. One user called for people to find out where the two worked."


THIS, is the Democrat Party.
