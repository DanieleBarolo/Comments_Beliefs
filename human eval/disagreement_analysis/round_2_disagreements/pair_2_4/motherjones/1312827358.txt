I wish you were intelligent, kind, funnier, a book reader, loved cats, and took your own advice.

  I wonder what would happen if Hobby Lobby would need to make a religious decision that would cost them a lot of money. Would they still insist on following their religious rules then?

    Lydia, writer Amanda Marcotte stated it best both clearly and concisely; "Plan B doesnâ€™t kill embryos, but knitting needles surely can. So why does Hobby Lobby still sell knitting needles?"

      because people like me never put things where they belong, and I never can find mine when I want them. smiles And because in the end, they care a lot about profits.


They sell a lot of cheaply made merchandise and they do not stand behind their products either.

        Just what do you actually do with your knitting needles?

          I use them to threaten men who aren't romantic?


smiles
 Really, I knit hats all year long and some scarves for the homeless men who go to the local shelter for meals. I worry about them being out on the streets in cold weather.


Also, I make some to donate to a school in a low income neighborhood. I mentioned to someone that I knitted and the next thing I knew, people I didn't even know started giving me their leftover yarn.


The only person I ever stabbed was myself, accidently, put it right through my side, and it came out about two inches over. Didn't hurt until I pulled it out. I don't carry them in my pocket anymore but I still lose them.
