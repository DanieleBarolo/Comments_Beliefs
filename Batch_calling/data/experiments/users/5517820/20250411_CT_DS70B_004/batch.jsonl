If the House of Saud commits fully to fighting ISIS, they'll face violence at home like they've never seen before.\n\n\nFurther, ISIS is making life more difficult for Iran and their pet terror groups Hezbollah in Syria and the Shiite militias in Iraq.

And why should they risk soiling their nifty white robes when they know that their Dear Ol' Uncle Sugar will come riding in with guns blazing and checkbooks flapping to save their sorry terror-backin' asses yet again?\n\n\nSaudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Pakistan.....with allies like these who needs a sharp stick in the eye for breakfast?

Attacking Trump seems impossible to them because they can't read what their own base wants. It doesn't seem like the base cares about Obamacare, or cares about Planned Parenthood, or any of the major things they THOUGHT the base liked.\n\nSo now they don't know how to attack Trump, and they know that if an attack backfires, they'll be out of the running entirely.\n\nPlus, I don't think they know how to attack a non-politician. He doesn't have a voting record that they can smear. It's an odd situation for the GOP to be in.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI think guys like Rubio really, truly do not understand why Trump appeals to people in the first place, and so they have no idea how to take him down. They're drunk on their own Kool-Aid*. Their idea of a devastating attack is to point out how Trump doesn't support the priorities of Republican elites... when of course, that lack of support for elite priorities is precisely what attracted Trump's supporters in the first place.\n\nIf I were a Democratic strategist, I would be planning a campaign to portray Donald Trump as a misogynist, racist plutocrat, and \"plutocrat\" would be the centerpiece. Highlight the working joes who lost their jobs thanks to his business failures. Highlight jobs he sent overseas. Note how much he personally would benefit from his tax cut program. Take his strength - his appeal to working-class nativism - and turn it into a weakness.

Wages and employment are countervailing forces, which can work together to power a \"virtuous cycle\" or a vicious one, but the nature of spiral movement is that such forces work <i>alternately</i> rather than simultaneously.\n \nSimple supply-and-demand economics says that employment growth will slacken while wages rise, and wages will plateau while there is a surge in employment.  When wages rise, a new tranche of labor becomes available, and it takes a while for employers to \"soak it up.\"  \n \nThe good news is, if the \"virtuous cycle\" holds, the growth in employment will then be followed by another spurt in wages, since there is no more labor available at the prevailing wage.  And ALL additional new jobs then are paid at the new, higher wage.\n \nI know many of us are Democrats, but let's not despair just yet.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI agree.

Trump has one hell of an instinct for who's got strength and who doesn't.  He mowed down the weaker GOPers with little effort while focusing his main attention on Jeb and then Marco because I think he instinctively sensed they were hollow men who looked strong but had insurmountable weakness built in.  Cruz outlasted everybody else because he was the strongest, most determined, most ambitious of the bunch and the most doctrinaire conservative and it took Trump a little longer to figure out what his vulnerability was.\n\nIOW, I don't believe for a minute he sat down and gamed this all out, but his instincts served him very well indeed.\n\nNow the question is whether his instincts will continue to work for rather than against him in the general election campaign.  One is tempted to say they won't, but we've underestimated those instincts from the get-go.  OTOH, it's not clear those instincts are anything more than dick-waving instincts, at which he excels, and which won't do the job in the general.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI honestly don't think trump planned anything.

Bob McDonnell skate on a technicality.  \"Setting up a meeting, talking to another official... without more, does not meet that definition of official act,\" they ruled.  \n\nSeems like that's construing 'official act' pretty narrowly.  I can't just call up a state government official and get him to meet with an acquaintance of mine, but the governor can do so, and with the inherent expectation that his request will be looked on as favorably as possible.  Nor can I use the governor's mansion, and my visible influence as governor (since I'm not governor), to boost a donor's product.  A definition of 'official act' that puts such action outside the realm of official action means that laws regulating official acts don't regulate much.\n\nIn McDonnell's case, the <i>quid pro quo</i> was pretty obvious, but it's gonna be OK for the gov because he wasn't acting officially.  Lucky him.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nBravo to the majority of the Supreme Court. \nStill need to fill a SC seat, and need to work to \nensure that the lower court vacancies are not \nfilled by the nominees of a Republican president, \nand confirmed by a Republican majority Senate. \n\n<i>\"Women's rights are human rights.\"</i>\n~ Hillary Clinton, September 5, 1995, China \n(UN World Conference On Women)\n\n<i>\"I'm here today because I'm with <u>her</u>!\"</i>\n~ Elizabeth Warren, campaigning \nfor/with Hillary Clinton today in Ohio. \n\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe Republicans need a large a large percentage of Obama voters flipping to Trump in the battleground states like PA, FL and OH to secure a win.

The Clinton campaign thought they were going to get largish numbers of usual GOP voters -- those turned off or scared away by Trump's numerous and extreme failings. That in substantial measure explains the Kaine pick, too. It's the old triangulation. In retrospect they should have been doing more to hold on to their own base. Going after GOP-leaners is a fool's game, and one I hope future Democratic tickets don't repeat.\n\nGiven the extreme outlier nature of Trump's candidacy, the Clinton campaign's miscalculation was understandable.

Consequences of a trade war won't be isolated to one economic class, including probably most of the posters here in one way or another \n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nRegardless of what Wilbur Ross thinks, it is unlikely that Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell will let a 5% tariff go through.  They claim to favor free trade, and much of their donations come from the business community that benefits from this free trade.\n\nThat said, there will be a lot of pain felt by working class whites based on Trump's polices (or lack thereof).  Many regulations designed to protect consumers and the environment will affect working class people the most if they are rolled back as expected.  Expected oil spikes will bring back inflationary cycles which also hurt working class the most as wages always lag behind rising prices.  And ultimately we are looking at a recession with Trump as interest rates rise precipitously to slow inflation, putting a lot of people out of work, most of which will be working class.  \n\nThe only issue I see is timing.  How fast and how far will America fall under Trump?  Will he be able to put off most of the pain until after the 2018 election; and if he does that, what position will that put the Republicans in 2020 with a down economy?  Like Reagan, I imagine Trump will try to distract the American people with war and terrorism, but when you are out of work and losing your home, I am not sure if anti-Muslim and anti-minority vitriol is going to save Trump and the Republicans in 2020, assuming they are able to avoid mass American economic pain before the 2018 elections.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI don't think Walmart agrees with you\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

When the economy is expanding, the economy needs the money supply to grow so that the demand for more transactions can be satisfied.  Credit expansion can do this over the short term, but that's inherently time limited as private sector balance sheets become more leveraged.  Federal deficit spending has no such time constraint.\n\nWhen you realize that \"national debt\" is just another way of saying \"the money supply\", the idea of reducing it when inflation is low becomes obviously stupid.\n\nEdit:  Also, we're running a trade deficit, which means that we're essentially exporting dollars.  If the federal deficit is smaller than the trade deficit then the dollars we're exporting are coming from the private sector, which either reduces the number of domestic transactions that can be accomodated, or simply time shifts this reduction in activity via private sector credit expansion.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nUS solar power employs more people than oil, coal and gas combined, report shows,\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-solar-power-employs-more-people-more-oil-coal-gas-combined-donald-trump-green-energy-fossil-fuels-a7541971.html\n\n<blockquote>Solar energy in the US employs more people than traditional coal, gas and oil combined, a report has found, in a revelation that could undermine Donald Trump\u2019s argument that green energy isn\u2019t good for the economy.\n. . .\nSolar energy employed 374,000 people over the year 2015-2016, making up 43 per cent of the sector\u2019s workforce, while the traditional fossil fuels combined employed 187,117, making up just 22 per cent of the workforce, according to the report.\n\n\u201cProportionally, solar employment accounts for the largest share of workers in the Electric Power Generation sector. This is largely due to the construction related to the significant build out of new solar generation capacity,\u201d the report states. \n\nIt adds that this gap is growing, with net generation from coal sources declining by 53 per cent between 2006 and September 2016, while electricity generation from natural gas increased by 33 per cent and solar by over 5,000 per cent in the same period.\n\nIn the past year alone, solar industry employment has increased by 25 per cent, adding 73,000 new jobs to the economy, while wind energy employment saw an even larger  increase of 32 per cent. Data in the report shows the overall number of jobs in energy efficiency increased by 133,000 to a total of 2.2 million within that year.\n\nAccording to the report, 6.4 million Americans now work in the energy industry and 2016 added 300,000 new net jobs, which made up 14 per cent of the entire job growth of the US for that year.\n. . . .</blockquote>\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe Bush Tax Cuts buried us\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

The last time we really had a chance to prevent it.  Now Trump is doing his best to blow up the iran deal in multiple ways.\n\nFrankly, I'm really not sure pundits  understand Trump yet.  Important to note that he believes his own lies and his own bluster.  He clearly believes there is a solution to the North Korea crisis via threat or force and he shows no signs of being willing to accept reality.  We depend on his aides to walk him down from this idiocy but they serve at his pleasure.  \n\nPeople didn't believe he was serious about his Muslim ban but he went ahead and did his best to implement it.

If you want to be State-of-the-art (and who doesn\u2019t in ER?), you must have the latest.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nA few factoids fwiw:\n-- ERs are profit centers for hospitals.  ER charges offset many of the losses hospitals incur from, e.g., treating patients who can't pay.\n-- \"Retail\" prices for hospital services -- ANY hospital services -- bear only some relation to the actual costs of providing those services.  This is true of medical prices generally, of course -- look at your next insurance benefits statement, and compare the \"charges\" to the amounts paid -- but it is especially true for hospital charges.\n-- The US has WAY too many hospitals.  Compare our distribution even to western Europe's, much less that of any other region.  As a result, they are engaged in terrible market competition, winnowing out, merging and consolidation, etc.  This exacerbates the two trends described above.  And it's made worse by \"critical care centers\" and other \"quasi-hospitals,\" who skim off the people who just need an antacid or an antibiotic, and send the serious medical problems to the real hospitals.\n-- Net result of all the above: \"retail\" ER charges are going through the roof.  $50 aspirins.  $75 bandages.  $500 for a brief MD consult.  \"Facility\" charges as noted.  And that's not counting what happens if you REALLY need help.\n\nFortunately, Donald Trump will fix all this.  Only he can do so.  We are saved, just in time!\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI'm referencing ER's that take appointments\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Do you really think they believe their tax plan is good for the middle class? Where have they shown any integrity? No, they don't believe their lies, and neither do the alt-right or most of the trolls here - they know they are dishonest, but they will go along with anything they think will benefit them.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAs far as Republican politicians and spokespeople go, they know what their talking points are and have them memorized, and the issue of whether or not what they are saying is true is probably not even something they concern themselves with. I doubt most of them even know or care whether they are telling the truth or lying, they just want to get their side\u2019s talking points out regardless of whether they are true or false. So asking whether they believe something or not is essentially a meaningless question as far as Republican politicians go, they do not really have \u201cbeliefs\u201d in the first place. They just know that they are supposed to say certain things if they want to achieve political success as politicians or PR flacks in their party, and whether something is true or false is the furthest thing from their minds, something they have long ago learned to ignore. Many of them believe that if you repeat a lie enough times it becomes the truth, and have convinced themselves that if they get enough people to believe something currently untrue, it will BECOME true, so their notions of truth vs. falsehood do not follow the traditional notion of there being a single objective reality that statements by humans cannot alter.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYes but look at the case of the vacant SC justice.

It doesn't get done with a rant, a logical argument, a pithy slogan, or a protest vote. \n\n2017 is what you get when you get railroaded, don't pay attention, don't understand basic civics, don't read the Democratic candidate's white papers, and don't bother to vote.  Don't do that again.  It sets shit back.  It puts Medicare-for-All (a goal of mainstream Democrats) further off.  The fight tomorrow isn't over that, it's over Trump's destruction of the federal government, DACA, CHIP, education, abortion rights, women's rights, the federal courts, keeping Trump from gutting social security and Medicare for retired people, investigating everything.\n\nMajorities in the senate and house will be a sorely needed check on Trump.  They won't get you Medicare for All and it won't get us back to where we were before we, the voters, screwed up in 2016. That will take a lot longer.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAs a HUGE supporter of the ACA and now single payer, I'd say no at this point but instead work to expand Medicaid to those that this tax package have lost coverage. I'd also highlight all the poor decisions Trump has made on appointments and executive orders with a plan to repeal those ASAP!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Unlike a lot of Trump's inner circle, Bannon is actually fairly bright and may have gamed this out far better than an administration where Dunning-Kreuger effect should be the motif on the wallpaper.\n\nSimply put, Trump almost certainly loses a feces-flinging cage match with Bannon because his hands are simply so much smaller.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBased on what I know about Trump and \"his lawyers\" I doubt he's taking their advice\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

But there were a handful of other Republican senators already there. Would we have ever heard about this if a Democrat hadn\u2019t been in the room?</blockquote>\n\nI wonder if Trump even realized that Durbin is a Democrat.  The president with the bigliest brain ever probably didn't recognize the Senate Minority Whip, saw a white guy in a suit and just assumed he was in friendly company.  It also makes me wonder what's said in Republican-only meetings.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThere is a lot of truth to what Kevin is saying but if Dump I freeing them up to say the \"obvious\" racists thing, then why are they soooo hurt when they are called on it?

(And some still-working people might roll over plans to an IRA when they change jobs.) So what had been a 401(k) suddenly gets added to the gross amounts in IRAs the second a person rolls over the old workplace 401(k).\n\nAlso, when talking about having an IRA for retirement, whether or not a person has a traditional IRA (deposits taxed when withdrawn) or a Roth IRA (taxed at savings time) can make a big difference, according to whether the market is high or low at deposit and withdrawal times.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nNice to se younger folks saving for retirement as I didn't start until I was 30.

And in the past few years, at a nightclub and a movie theater, and another church.  And there are an abundance of other potential locations: shopping malls, professional conventions, crowded restaurants, Mardi Gras in New Orleans, New Year's Eve in Times Square.  The list goes on.  Are we going to strategize about how to prevent mass shootings in each one individually?  That's freakin' crazy.\n\nNo, we say, \"FU, NRA, we need an across-the-board solution.  And the only one that makes sense is to take weapons of mass slaughter out of civilian life altogether, and more tightly control the guns that should remain legal.  You can help us craft legislation to this effect, or you can put up with what we write.

Corporate Tax Cuts Are Making the Rich Even Richer\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nMany of them didn't even wait for the money to show up, borrowing money to get the buybacks set to go as soon as possible. That tells you how eager they were to unleash them as soon as the funds were available. When Democrats come back into power they should slap those with a 30-40% tax, just like corporate income tax. It'll either raise money or reduce the buybacks, which is a win either way. \n\n<blockquote>You betcha. We\u2019ll be seeing those fatter paychecks any day now.</blockquote>\n\nCan't wait for that $1000 bonus that I'd only be eligible for if I worked there 20 years or more! I get it - bonuses are more attractive to companies than wage increases for the same reason buybacks are more attractive than increasing dividends (neither imply a permanent commitment to paying more). But it still sucks. \n\nThis is where having far stronger unions would make a difference. Contrast this with what IG Metall is negotiating in Germany - if we had unions that strong, there'd be real paycheck increases here in the US. \n\n<blockquote> Republicans fully expected this, and all their blather about \u201ccapital formation\u201d and \u201c$4,000 in wage growth\u201d was just the usual smokescreen to justify a giveaway to the rich.</blockquote>\n\nOf course they knew it. They were so desperate to get it done by hook or by crook, because their wealthy donors basically told them to get it done or they could forget about getting a gusher of donations to help them weather a difficult 2018 election year.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI did\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

This was from the State Dept. on Monday:\n\n<blockquote>The United States was in touch with our Allies in the United Kingdom ahead of today\u2019s announcement, including in a call between Secretary Tillerson and Foreign Secretary Johnson this morning. We have full confidence in the UK\u2019s investigation and its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury last week.\n\nThere is never a justification for this type of attack \u2013 the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation \u2013 and <b>we are outraged that Russia appears to have again engaged in such behavior</b>. From Ukraine to Syria \u2013 and now the UK \u2013 Russia continues to be an irresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their \ncitizens.\n\nWe agree that those responsible \u2013 both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it \u2013 must face appropriately serious consequences. We stand in solidarity with our Allies in the United Kingdom and will continue to coordinate closely our responses.</blockquote>https://ru.usembassy.gov/statement-secretary-tillerson-attributing-responsibility-nerve-agent-attack-u-k/\n\n\nIt's not about Trump acting rashly and irrationally.  It's Trump covering for Putin.  Again and again.  Trump for all intents and purposes is an agent for Russia.  He's not even hiding it.\n\n\nI know we're supposed to be wiser now, deep in the Trump era, but I'm still stunned.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nat least h can file for unemployment benefits now..lol\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

These people are intensely tribal, many of them are religion-driven, and they demonstrated very clearly last time out that they consider democrats to be even more dangerous than Russians. \n\nAnd of course Trump's moves over the last 24 hours to hire InfoWars ranters and Fox news ravers shows that he's planning to run an even more rabid, conspiracy-driven, pseudo populist campaign than he did in 2016 in support of his party's candidates and as a way of setting the stage for firing Robert Mueller. \n\nIf the left doesn't close ranks in response to the coming neo McCarthy onslaught, and possibly a war, and possibly a Constitutional crisis via Saturday Night Massacre 2.0, we're screwed. I don't care what the charts say. \n227 days to go. Don't take anything for granted. This is going to be equal parts brutal and way butt-ugly.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\ncorrect.

To be a living human being you must have a functional cerebral cortex function. You know what human beings without a function cerebral cortex are called?  (brain) Dead\n\nYou know what happens to living human beings who no longer show cerebral cortex function? They are declared brain dead and it is perfectly legal to disconnect life support,  begin organ harvesting, cremation or burial.\n\nSigh, lets get technical then even though you anti-science and medical fact nuts usually get real big on personal attacks when you do not like the facts\n\nBrain death is diagnosed by measuring the electrical activity (with an EEG) in the cerebral cortex. No activity= you are brain dead. You might still have activity in the primitive parts of the brain but no activity in the cerebral cortex.\n\n A fetus before at the very earliest 26-28 weeks does not have sustained bilaterally synchronous electroencephalographic patterns (yes as measured by the same machine, EEG, as used to diagnose brain death)\n\nIn short, a fetus before 26 weeks gestation at the very earliest does not have cerebral cortex function just like a beating heart cadaver that was declared brain dead and therefore is not a living human being merely a potential that might never actualize (unless you are now going to deny another medical fact that miscarriage and stillbirth do not exist either) \nYou know who is actually undeniably alive?

The dream of Social Security privatization that launched his policy relevance is dead. The Medicare privatization plan that relaunched his policy relevance is also dead. His reputation as a deficit hawk has been exposed as a sham. He didn\u2019t repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he didn\u2019t undo the Obama administration\u2019s financial regulations. The year isn\u2019t over yet, but Congress has basically abandoned hope of doing anything else.\n\nWhat he got was a tax cut, the thing that every Republican majority gets.\n\nAnd since that\u2019s what his donors wanted in the end, that\u2019s probably the important thing. But it is worth saying that the tax cut ultimately came together because Republicans abandoned Ryan\u2019s vision of a high-minded tax reform and his dumb talking point about filing taxes on a postcard. At the end of the day, they slapped together an old-fashioned deficit-financed tax cut for the rich that throws quarters at the middle class in hopes of disguising the $10 bills handed out to the rich. Flimflam and phaseout gimmicks, rather than reform and loophole closing, make it work.</blockquote>\n\n\"House Speaker Paul Ryan was the biggest fraud in American politics\"\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/4/11/17223942/house-speaker-paul-ryan-fraud\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe GOP swamp is deep\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Religious fundamentalism is what has shaped most of their belief systems.\"\n\n\"Systems built on a fundamentalist framework are not conducive to introspection, questioning, learning, change. When you have a belief system that is built on fundamentalism, it isn\u2019t open to outside criticism, especially by anyone not a member of your tribe and in a position of power.\" {...}\n\n\"Another problem with rural, Christian, white Americans is they are racists.

I\u2019m talking about people who deep down in their heart of hearts truly believe they are superior because they are white.\" {...}\n\n\"They are white supremacists who dress up in white dress shirts, ties, and gingham dresses.

Victimhood and ideological militancy are integral aspects of their identity. So when Trump started banging the \"only I can save you\" drum and promised to become their Great White Savior in the culture wars, they abandoned most of what they claim to value to vote for him.

The man is a clear and present danger to America.\n\nOh... and then there's that other part where Nasty-Vald Putin said in an interview recently that he and Trump \"talk all the time\". That's some scary shit right there. God-only-knows how that hyper-sinister old KGB agent is \"handling\" his pet president and favorite asset.

Bah, you Leftists are always going on about equality of outcomes.  You know who else wanted equality of outcomes?  Chairman Mao.  That means you Leftists are literally Chairman Mao.  Who was very intolerant, and also very unscientific, so checkmate.  The scientific thing to do would be to organize society along the lines of decapod hierarchies.  It's what John Locke argued in <i>Two Treatises</i>.  That, and against the tyrannical absolutism posed by nineteen year olds calling me \"privileged.\" Or at least, it's what I think he would have argued, if I had ever actually read Locke.  I'm sure we'd have gotten along great, if he'd known me.  I would totally be his fellow traveler, because I am a very intelligent and reasonable person, just like Locke.

Crazy, crazy, crazy.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nRemember, this is coming from the same guy who said the following during the election:\n\n<blockquote>\u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people \u2014 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nThis was actually an echo of Sharron Angle's \"Second Amendment solutions\" remark in the 2010 Senate race (which thankfully didn't happen after she lost). If you think about it, the very name of the Tea Party movement is an incitement to violence. Yes, the historical event it references was itself an act of nonviolent civil disobedience--but it was the run-up to armed revolt against the government.

And the only reasons she's not raped is because they were too drunk to be even more efficient than they already were, and she had on a one piece bathing suit.\n\nFOR FUCK'S SAKE! WHAT THE HELL DOES IT TAKE FOR OLDER WHITE MEN TO STOP GIVING OTHER WHITE MEN THE BENEFIT OF THE FUCKING DOUBT!!!\n\nIf you don't think that -- provided he could perform -- Kavanaugh & probably Judge wouldn't have raped her if he could just get through her clothes, then you are delusional. Jesus fucking Christ.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHis defense and that of the GOP further pushes them right into Putin's arms.

If they just don't care, then there's no electoral \"there\" there.\n\nAnd they won't stay off my lawn, dammit!\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI spent an afternoon at UC Irvine doing voter registration a few weeks ago. It was a Sunday and was a total bust. Very few people on campus. But I did talk to 20-25 students. Learned some things.\n\n1) Undergraduates are mostly clueless. They're just learning to be on their own after years of having everything done for them. They're busy learning to keep a schedule and remember to eat. If there's a homework set due the day after election day, there's a 90% chance they won't vote. Just my impressions.\n\n2) Lots of college kids are confused about whether they can vote where they go to college. When they learn they can vote at the college address, they're not sure about changing their address. The point is: lotsa complications.\n\n3) Graduate students are up on things and focused. Since they take pride in being opinionated and are about to launch themselves into the job market, they are politically aware and know about candidates and elections.\n\nAll of this to me adds up to: the vote yield/volunteer time with youth voter registration/canvassing ratio is really really low.\n\nIf I were running a \"youth voting organization\" I would\n\n-- Focus on grad students and, along with that, getting grad students to get their siblings/younger friends to vote through some sort of app as mentioned in KD's post.\n\n-- Have rallies with Taylor Swift types wherever possible\n\n-- Work on passing laws that register students to vote at their current address when they register for classes, and that put voting places right on campus, in the student center.\n\nJust to be clear: I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm just throwing out the ideas that came to mind after my 3 hours wandering around trying to register people.\n\nOh, another thing I'll add -- my 3 hours and my tiny sample of conversations convinced me I've underestimated how much undergraduates don't like both parties and view them both as collections of selfish, inept adults who are messing up the world for them. In other words, they don't see the profound difference between the parties I do.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLike the GOP?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Contrary to popular belief Trump is not a particularly good liar. He seems to go out of his way to make his claims sound as outlandish as possible. But he knows how to nurture his cult, and--this is the most crucial point--he has right-wing media ready to defend and amplify every lie that comes out of his mouth.\n\nAs a contrast, think back to the way Bush justified the invasion of Iraq at one of the debates: \"The enemy attacked us.\" He never said outright that Saddam was behind 9/11, but he was clearly trying to imply it. That's the old method of deception in politics: use careful wording to give your lies plausible deniability. If Trump had been in the same position, he would have simply declared that Saddam had personally given the call that brought down the towers. And FOX, Breitbart and all the rest would have come up with lengthy defenses of this claim.\n\nEven back in mid-2015 when right-wing media was not totally on Trump's side since he had no power at that point (wasn't president, wasn't even the GOP nominee and was widely regarded as a long-shot if not an absurd impossibility to become either), he was largely saying things that FOX et al had been inculcating their audience with for years. Once he became the nominee, and later the president, they became committed to brainwashing their audience into accepting whatever crazy thing came out of Donald Trump's mouth. They would have done it for any GOP leader, of course; they did do it for Bush, and they would have done it for Romney or Rubio or any other Republican who happened to make it to the White House. But with Trump, they also have make sure they're not running aground of the cult.

And if *that* works, my friends and neighbors to the south, I\u2019m sorry but your country won\u2019t recover for a generation, if ever.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAs of tomorrow morning, there will be 13 days to go until the election. Just as he did in 2016, Trump has taken command of the news cycle and the allegedly liberal MSM is refusing to stand up to him. They don't have the journalistic fortitude to call him what he is.....a pathological liar, a criminal and a traitor who's a clear and present danger to the future of our nation...... They'd rather keep their jobs than do their jobs.\n\nAnd just as they did two years ago, the media has failed miserably to alert the American people to the magnitude of the assault on the integrity of the electoral system by the republicans. Both stories; Trump's ever more in-your-face pathologies and the GOP's assault on the rights of voters should be on the front page of every legitimate newspaper.....should be the lead story on every honest newscast.....but that's not how it is. \n\nWe are perilously close to losing everything we've worked for over the last century, and every time I hear the phrase \"the blue wave\" my blood boils. Anybody who thinks the republicans aren't capable of winning<b>/</b>stealing this election and holding the House and the Senate must have been asleep throughout November of 2016........It's not time to panic.......It's time to go to war......Vote like it's your last chance.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIf there's one thing I learned about Trump and that is when he accuses others at doing bad things it's more distracting people from him doing the exact same thing!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Barack and Michelle Obama gave some of the best and most impassioned speeches of their lives in 2016 and virtually begged black voters to get themselves to the polls, yet they didn't turn out in numbers one would expect given the blatant racism that Trump had demonstrated throughout his campaign.\n\nThe implications are pretty clear.......Many people of color don't trust the democratic party. But it still doesn't make sense to not fight back against the republicans. Even if the idea of voting for the \"lesser of two evils\" is utterly repugnant to you, consider that there has never been a racist evil in the oval office like Trump. He's not on the ballot, but the stench and stain of the racist fear and loathing he's spreading is everywhere.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYup, it's flooding the Philly/SNJ market\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

There were only 3 balls instead of 10, there were no big name stars, the crowds were much smaller, etc. Our taxes pay for security so that didn\u2019t factor into the cost even though a portion of the crowd were protesters. There were a number of contributors, believed to be foreign, who donated $1M each and got vip access. Why did it cost twice as much for much less?  Who skimmed $ off the top. Trump DC hotel doubled the price of rooms, so that went directly to profits. It sounds like a typical trump scam.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat's what the American evangelicals have become.

Kim sent a message via some South Korean officials suggesting talks with Trump - a proposal North Korea has made frequently over the years. To everyone's amazement, Trump said \"Sure, why not?\" and proceeded to announce it in the Rose Garden, prompting chants of \"Nobel! Nobel!\" which continue to this day. Nobody's planned anything; both sides are simply reacting to Trump's erratic tweeting. Kim is trying to take advantage of his amazing good fortune, American officials are trying to maintain a semblance of consistent policy without making their boss look a complete idiot.\n\nNeither Kim nor the State Department knew what the fuck was going on, which wasn't surprising because Trump didn't either. Officials from both sides held talks where they predictably didn't agree about anything. Trump and Kim had a meeting in Singapore which Trump announced, to a flabbergasted world, meant peace in our time when clearly nothing of consequence had been agreed at all. So naturally Kim rejoiced in his good fortune and officials from both sides held more talks where they predictably didn't agree about anything.\n\nFinally Kim and Trump had dinner in Vietnam, followed by a brief chat where Trump proposed a ridiculous deal and Kim said no, let's get serious. When he realised there was nothing else forthcoming, he muttered some coarse insults in Korean and went sightseeing in Hanoi while Sarah Sanders complained plaintively that they'd cancelled lunch.\n\nStripped of all the bullshit, officials from both countries have held a series of fruitless talks, exactly as expected, because America is not willing to make any concessions until North Korea has basically disarmed. The Kim/Trump performances have taken place in a make-believe world which has no relevance to the real one, but only Kim seems to understand this.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nhe's socially retarded\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And it is the <i>lowest</i> of political skills to appeal to authoritarianism and inflame tribal differences.  A difficult or closely-divided situation is fertile ground for a charlatan.  \n\nGotta admit, it's kind of embarrassing that Trump, Boris Johnson, AND Bibi Netanyahu are all American-trained.  America: world's best charlatans.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThe USA has 40 years of voter suppression in the form of the once-conservative Republican Party demonizing government, and upon gaining the reins of that government, removing protections for certain cadres of workers and citizens. Until at last people felt like their government was against them, because it was. \n\nThey've also dispensed with the traditional English language, substituting word for word until nothing holds meaning. Money equals speech. Corporations have religious rights. Protecting the environment is killing jobs. \n\nAnd they've dehumanized all opposition. \nLock her up. \n\nAnd now, finally, this past midterm election had the highest turnout in 40 years.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n87K votes in MI, PA and WI.

It would make me terribly upset if Trump did something like that. The only thing worse, and please Your Magnificence, don't do it or it will be very bad, would be to give them green cards and put them on a path to citizenship. Then they might decide to live here permanently, buying stuff, selling stuff, paying taxes. I could go on, but I'm getting scared just thinking about it.\n\nThis is why I almost voted for Trump in 2016, when that guy said Hillary might be put a taco truck on every corner. We couldn't handle that, primarily because we've already got taquerias on every corner, with many corners hosting two or three. (If there's a convenience store, there's a taqueria, even an occasional pupuseria.) A bunch of taco trucks would just block traffic and traffic is bad enough already, thank you very much.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nEver see a dog with diarrhea?

Where are the red blooded American patriots in the DOJ ?\nYour country needs you now more than ever before.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI guess he didn't like me calling Sarah Fat Neck and his son Dog Killer\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Obviously, someone told him recently about Article 2 of the US Constitution and the powers given to the POTUS in the first 3 sections.  Since he has the attention span of an Adderall-addicted fruit fly, he probably zoned out and came away with \"I'm super-powerful and can do whatever I want.\"\n\n\nHe should really pay more attention to Section 4 of Article 2.
