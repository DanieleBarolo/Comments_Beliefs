'Conditions of lust?' What century were you born in? You sound like some kind of hellfire preacher, terrifying his congregation that women will corrupt their souls. Artificial contraceptives are medicines. Pregnancy is a medical condition. A condition that conservatives seem to want women to be in barefooted and in the kitchen. You talk about my 'rants?' Yours make no sense. Medical doctors can ascertain if men are having ED due to prostate cancer and other life-threatening conditions. And devices like penis pumps are for penis enlargement, not to treat ED. The government spent $174 million dollars in one year for buying 400,000 old codgers pumps they could have bought for 1/20th that much at a sex shop. Somehow, when men have sex, it's a medical condition. When women do, it's a condition of lust. Guys like you would have been great at the Salem witch trials.

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

PARENT COMMENT:
Trying to simplify your insane rant, I wish to point out that if a man can't urinate, it is a medical problem; if a man cannot get an erection, he may have a medical problem; if a woman has a problem with one of her sexual organs, that is a medical problem. If both parties are well enough to have sex, then the contraceptive is NOT a medical problem. We agree to pay for medical conditions, not conditions of lust, whether by married couples or street whores. Actions have consequences that we are each personally responsible for without liberal entitlements.

Why aren't they are also against paying for penis pumps, Viagra, and Cialis?  It's God's will when a man can't "stand proud" on his own.

  I think if you were to try all three of those at once, you'd probably explode.
Perhaps you can engage this Aquarium_Dreamer's experiment to combine oral contraceptives and LSD (see below.)
Say what you will about the left, but they are creative. ;-)

    Actually, these are products that are covered by Medicare that conservatives never go on rants about. Penis pumps, penile implants and drugs that address erectile dysfunction never receive rants from conservative talk show hosts about promiscuous behavior from their users and how tax-payer should subsidize their sex lives. It seems such vitriol is only reserved for women.

      A physical dysfunction is a health issue, needing attention to be normal again in that area, or as much as possible. It is not the same as paying for the tools of promiscuous sex, where personal responsibility should reign. This goes beyond the main purpose of health insurance. Otherwise, why not include vitamins and organic food, etc., etc.? Where do the entitlements stop?

        A 'physical dysfunction' to have sex? So you're defending Medicare covering such devices as penis pumps, which are mainly for male enhancement? You can argue that married women, who are the biggest users of contraceptives, are wildly promiscuous, but give a free pass to men who want sexual devices to enlarge their pencil dicks? Why aren't you concerned that men might be having wild promiscuous sex with their sexual aids? Contraceptives aren't sexual aids. They're to genuinely prevent a condition called PREGNANCY, which is a health condition, that is monitored by medical professionals. You conservatives have labeled every woman that uses contraceptives as wanton Jezebels. Even among Catholic women, 95% have claimed to have used artificial contraceptives at one time. I guess just about every woman in the country must meet your definition of promiscuous.
