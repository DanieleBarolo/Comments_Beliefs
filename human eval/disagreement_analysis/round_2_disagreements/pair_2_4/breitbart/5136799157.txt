The MSM is making Trump seem like the underdog, and biden the expected winner. Its the same fake leftwing narrative they used in 2016 all over again...truly shameless propaganda...
...
Please say a Prayer for Trump, and the Victory for the American people on election day, with another 4 years of Trump as POTUS, and The Senate and House under Republican control.

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come;
thy will be done;
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.

GET OUT AND VOTE PATRIOTS!!!
