If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

It's a Darwin thing. It will be women that bring down the rate of gun ownership. Women understand that they are less likely to live long enough to reproduce if they are in the presence of a man with a gun. And they understand that IF they do live long enough to reproduce, their children are less likely to reach maturity if they are in the vicinity of a gun.


When has anyone ever heard a woman say, "Oh, I really want my future husband and father of my children to own a gun"?

  Strangely enough, my wife, after a failed marriage to a liberal, said exactly that.  She had a certain set of characteristics she wanted in the man who would ultimately father her children.  Her mother, a FDR Democrat, said the same thing.  My mother said the same thing.  I hope my daughter says the same thing.  
**************
Speaking of my mother, a JFK Democrat, she watched the original Red Dawn with me when i was in my late teens.  She told me that if the scenario ever played out, and I was not fighting outside of the fence, she would come back to haunt me.
***************
Many women who are daughters of real men bring their kids to me to learn informally about shooting.  The are either single or have married men who don't know the basics.  I'm pretty sure they would have preferred to marry someone who had discipline and determination to learn the many martial arts involved with high level shooting.

    You watched the original <i>Red Dawn</i>? How cool! I was an extra in that movie! Had to turn down an offer for a ten day speaking part since I couldn't get that much time off work, but put in one day as an extra.
