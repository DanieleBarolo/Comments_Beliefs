ARTICLE BODY:

A gunman opened fire on a country music concert outside the Mandalay Bay casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sunday evening.

Fifty-nine people are confirmed dead and there are 527 reported injured. The shooter, named as Stephen Paddock, was confirmed dead by Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

The gunman opened fire on tens of thousands of concertgoers gathered for the Route 91 Harvest country music festival.

Update — 10:25 p.m. PDT:As late-night host Jimmy Kimmel lectures Americans about the “gun lobby,” footage emerges of a performance right before the shooting began. Country music stars Big & Rich performed “God Bless America” during their set at the country music festival, just an hour before gunfire rang across the plaza. The footageshowsthousands of fans holding their cell phones aloft — thousands of lights in the night sky — and singing along.

Nearly 600 of those in the crowd would later be wounded, dozens of them fatally so.

Update — 9:45 p.m. PDT:The Associated Pressreportsthat the gunman owned two “bump stocks,” legal devices that can mimic the effect of automatic weapons fire when attached to a semiautomatic rifle. It is not known whether he used them in the shooting.

Update — 7:20 p.m. PDT:The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department announced at an evening briefing that the suspect had been determined to have 23 firearms at the Mandalay Bay, and 19 at his home in Mesquite. The police continued to investigate evidence at the Mesquite home to determine the motive of the killer. He had acted alone, police said. Blood banks had received so many donations that they did not need any more help, they said. The police commissioner said that the department had received $2.2 million from a total of 30,000 donors, after setting an initial target of raising $500,000 as part of a donation drive to support the victims of the shooting.

Update — 5:45 p.m. PDT:On ESPN’sMonday Night Football, the entire Washington Redskins squad stood for the national anthem. Most of the Kansas City Chiefs did as well.

Two members of the Chiefs, linebacker Ukeme Eligwe and cornerback Marcus Peters,satfor the anthem. Peters was promptly burned by the Redskins’ Terrelle Pryor, Sr. for a touchdown inside the first three minutes of the game.

Update — 1:15 p.m. PDT:NBCreports that Paddock was a very high roller in recent days:

On several occasions, Stephen Paddock gambled more than $10,000 per day — and in some cases more than than $20,000 and $30,000 a day — at Las Vegas casinos, according to an NBC News source who read the suspect’s Multiple Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) and a casino gaming executive.

Update — 12:58 p.m. PDT:Crucial detail from Sheriff Lombardo’s press conference earlier this afternoon:

Update — 12:50 p.m. PDT:Oddly enough, it’s theWashington Postthat thoroughly destroys Hillary Clinton’s non sequitur about “silencers” and the Vegas shooting:

Clinton and others appear to be assuming that silencers — or “suppressors,” as they’re known in the industry — work the way that they do in the movies. Screw a little barrel on the end of your pistol, and you can run through enemy headquarters picking off bad guys with no more audio footprint than a littlezip.

Update — 9:04 a.m. PDT:More biographical details on Paddock from theWashington Post:

Diane McKay lived next door to Paddock and Danley until July, when McKay moved to a different community, but said she only ran into Danley occasionally when both women happened to be pulling weeds from the front yard. Danley wasn’t forthcoming about her life, and Paddock was aggressively unfriendly, McKay recalls. She only saw him in the mornings, when he went to the club house to work out. Occasionally, he would open the garage door, revealing a large refrigerator safe. Other than that, the couple kept their blinds closed.

“He was weird. Kept to himself,” said McKay, 79, who described Paddock as small but in pretty good shape. “It was like living next to nothing…You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet. He never went out in back and enjoyed the backyard, nature. They had a little backyard, 17 feet to the fence and hill. But the blinds were always closed.”

McKay said the couple was gone for six months last year, which she thought was for a gambling trip.

Paddock’s family said there was nothing in his past that would suggest violence. Family members said that Paddock spent much of his retirement in recent years staying in hotels in Las Vegas and gambling. They said he listened to country music and went to concerts at Vegas hotels, similar to the one Sunday night where he opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers.

Public records show the gunman Paddock was a licensed pilot who owned two planes. And he had a hunting license from Alaska.
