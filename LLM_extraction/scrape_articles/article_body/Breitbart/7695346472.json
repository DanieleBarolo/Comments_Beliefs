So take off all [your] clothes [and] get back your big booties buts back into Big Daddy’s hot tub. Don’t bring Streisand. Too freaky.”“Is this tweet considered online sexual harassment or predatory behavior?” the pair complained. “Where is the #MeToo movement. Tom Arnold, you may not have respect for yourself but you don’t get to disrespect Diamond and Silk!”It is not the first time that Arnold hassharedhis sexual fantasies about political figures. In July, he professed his infatuation with Rep. Ilhan Omar (R-MN), describing her as “beautiful, smart [and] brave.”“If I’m lucky we’ll fall in love,” he wrote at the time.In August, the 60-year-old actor also fantasized about standing over the dead body of President Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.“Looking forward to the day I’m standing over him wearing my bullet belt & safari khakis, my cartoon sized Daniel Boone buck knife in one hand his his [sic] teeny tiny tail in the other,” Arnold wrote in response to a photo of Don Jr. on a hunting expedition.Last year, Arnold was interviewed by U.S. Secret Service agentsvisitedhim at his home to warn him that his tweets could incite violence against high-ranking politicians or even the president himself.“Thank you US Secret Service for risking your lives keeping democracy safe,” Arnold said in a statement following the visit. “I appreciate you coming to my home on what must’ve been a busy day. I heard your message loud & clear. Words matter. Tone matters. Words can incite violence.
