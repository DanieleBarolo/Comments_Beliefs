But it has to exist all over the world. … I mean, it’s not just people in Latin America who would gravitate to the United States. It is people all over the world. And it means that we have to deal with the crises in these countries right now so that people can possibly stay there, and we have to welcome people all over the world.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter@IanHanchett", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/09/19/sanders-i-would-be-positively-disposed-to-expanding-asylum-to-include-climate-refugees/"}
