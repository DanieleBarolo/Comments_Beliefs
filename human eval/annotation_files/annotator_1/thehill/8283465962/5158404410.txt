There's a reason Guiliani and Powell are laying out their case in a press conference instead of a courtroom.

  True. Because it's a crime to bring a case to a federal court without evidence. I literally just learned that.

    Even the plaintiffs in the cases on Judge Judy, where she can't award more than $5,000 need evidence or they're thrown out.

      The president of the United States is an absolute joke, this is unbelievably embarrassing.

        A bad poem for the occasion: 

Hair dye dribbling down his chin
Giuliani babbled -- Trump will win! 
He babbled about Soros -- and a Soros plot! 
Evidence? Are you crazy? None, nada, not! 

Alas Trump's a loser -- his end is near
He'll soon be booted out on his REAR

              <b>There is no constitutional path forward at all for Trump to remain in the White House.
</b>
This is no longer about Trump.
This is about his GOP enablers.
Always has been really.

The GOP has deteriorated into a corrupt cult of immoral bigots who have launched a direct and continued attack on American democracy.
