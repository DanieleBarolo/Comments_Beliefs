Id take it up a notch tho.  From now on, use the term \"bloody Indian scalp\" instead of redskins.  That will get some attention and maybe get some people thinking.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNothing worse than a very lucky stupid fuck who doesn't have the decency to clamp his pie hole. Snyder must have looked at Trump (who is 20 years older) and thought...\"<I>what can I do to inherent that awesome legacy when he drops dead?</I>\". Considering that Trump has perfected the art of being a grossly idiotic misogynist, racist, anti-American bigot, Snyder has his work cut out for him. Digging in on a genocidal racist slur is a good start though.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWashington Powhatans?\n\nAny takers?\n\nEdit:  Never mind, it should probably be the Washington Nacotchtank:\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacotchtank\n\nWashington Anacostia?

And it seems to me that if the scientific community really cared about global warming, they'd quit spending millions trying to scare the hell out of everyone, and instead try to give us a viable alternative. \n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nRockport, MO (a republican state I believe) claims it is the first city in the nation to be 100% dependent on wind energy.\n\n\nIt is spreading all over Iowa and MO. and somewhere west of Iowa because the enormous blades get carried west across Iowa nearly all year long.\n\n\nMaybe we can't replace our energy from one source, maybe we need to find what works best in each area, while working on new ideas.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYes, Earth gas is cheaper... if you don't calculate the cost of polluting groundwater and the astronomical cost of climate change that fracking for Earth gas causes.\n\n\nWhy would you forget to calculate that, hmmm?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I keep forgetting that every single GOP Rep called <b>me</b> first, before stripping out production tax credits for wind and solar, cutting the budget for the EPA, and killing a carbon tax in its infancy to ensure that we all get to keep paying MASSIVE sums on the back-end, for obsolete energy technology.\n\n\nYou're a genius.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI actually don't like calling CO&#8322; a pollutant either, though the <i>amount</i> of CO&#8322; we've added to the atmosphere poses a risk far larger than any other pollution source possibly could.\n\n\nThe <i>reason</i> I don't like calling CO&#8322; a pollutant, is because it reinforces a kind of black and white thinking that diverts attention away from possible solutions to the problem.\n\n\nFor example, biofuels like <i>methane</i> produce CO&#8322; when burned, but since all of that CO&#8322; originally came from the air on short timescales, a fuel like this is still carbon-neutral, and can actually be carbon <i>negative</i> if extracted properly.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It involves oil and gas control of the entire region and the weakening of Russia and Iran by Saudi Arabian flooding the world market with cheap oil. Details were concluded in the September meeting by US Secretary of State John Kerry and the Saudi King. The unintended consequence will be to push Russia even faster to turn east to China and Eurasia.\n\n[...]According to Rashid Abanmy, President of the Riyadh-based Saudi Arabia Oil Policies and Strategic Expectations Center, the dramatic price collapse is being deliberately caused by the Saudis, OPEC\u2019s largest producer. The public reason claimed is to gain new markets in a global market of weakening oil demand. The real reason, according to Abanmy, is to put pressure on Iran on her nuclear program, and on Russia to end her support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</i> - See more at: http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2014/10/24/the-secret-stupid-saudi-us-deal-on-syria/#sthash.TXQGSlX2.dpuf\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nMore Soviet propaganda Dmitri?

It involves oil and gas control of the entire region and the weakening of Russia and Iran by Saudi Arabian flooding the world market with cheap oil. Details were concluded in the September meeting by US Secretary of State John Kerry and the Saudi King. The unintended consequence will be to push Russia even faster to turn east to China and Eurasia.\n\n[...]According to Rashid Abanmy, President of the Riyadh-based Saudi Arabia Oil Policies and Strategic Expectations Center, the dramatic price collapse is being deliberately caused by the Saudis, OPEC\u2019s largest producer. The public reason claimed is to gain new markets in a global market of weakening oil demand.

Jimbo is <i>correct</i> that eliminating animals from one's diet is one of the most effective ways an individual has to lower her carbon footprint, even though animal agriculture itself is completely carbon-neutral.\n\nThe <i>reason</i> why animal agriculture has a larger carbon footprint is because we use fossil fuels to run it, and it requires much more fossil fuel per calorie than plant agriculture.\n\nIt's actually fairly important to understand the difference between the short and long carbon cycles, because disrupting the long carbon cycle is why we find ourselves in this mess and <i>interrupting</i> the short carbon cycle is one of the best ways to fix it.\n\nTreating any organic material anaerobically will lock down the carbon in it, whether that material be wood or cow pies.  The black coming out of the barrel here is pure, stabilised carbon from the sky:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=RXMUmby8PpU\n\nI'm not entirely sure why biochar consistently gets ignored in discussions of geoengineering.

I believe human released CO2 adds to the greenhouse temperature and may impact climate. But I also believe most alarmist claims are outrageously unscientific and unsubstantiated by the data. The models have proved to have poor predictable value. And a witch hunt atmosphere has been created that is bad for science.\n\nThe evidence is that we have fewer storms now, far fewer, and there is no real evidence they are any stronger. Level 5 pacific cyclones are right on the average in terms of number per decade. Atlantic hurricanes are waaaaay down at historical lows. Tornadoes are also at historic lows. \n\nAs with the Michael Brown shooting, I urge people to start looking at evidence more carefully, and try to understand the ideologically driven biases that impact reporting.\n\nNOTE: watch the comments below for evidence of reality filtering. People will do anything to prevent any challenge to narratives they cherish. Rather than challenge themselves, they sink to sarcasm and excuses to avoid evidence they don't like.

It would be incredibly sad, but I think they have the right to do that if life is simply too painful to bear.\n\nThey do not have the right to take anyone else with them:\n\n<blockquote>\"Data from NASA's Grace satellites show that the land ice sheets in both Antarctica and Greenland are losing mass.\"</blockquote>\n\nclimate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Leasing the panels? $1 says the consumer is worse off than if they bought the panels outright. Over here, in the UK, the majority own their panels, and those that work through a middleman are distinctly worse off, paying the costs, taking the risks, but sharing the profits. And in the US, isn't it the installer who gets the State/Federal grants (where they exist?). Over here, it's the power that attracts the grant, in the form of guaranteed prices for the electricity; again, more incentive to own your own panels, with  a loan to set it up if you need one.\nCompetition is likely in the interests of the consumer - if nothing else, it keeps the utilities honest - if the independents can show where the competition is unfair, there may be an issue ... but nothing in the article suggests that. Indeed, the article seems to suggest that they simply pass on the power and take a percentage; how do they deserve that?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThere is a case to be made for publicly-owned utilities.

The subject is fascinating to me!\n\nIf you don't live in a geologically active part of the world, I would highly recommend visiting one.  Geology was very much a mystery to me until I took a tour of California with a geologist.  There are amazing cliffs right near San Francisco where the San Andreas goes into the sea.  They span about 5 million years of history, and if you go with someone who can explain what you're looking at, it's incredibly cool.  You can see the climate warming and cooling over and over and over again with the Milankovitch cycles and then you see it interrupted by massive volcanic events... and sometimes there are even mastadon fossils washed out after it rains!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If this election suggests anything it's that we're at a disruptive moment in American politics (I.e., note the quick pace at which marijuana is becoming legalized and judicial protection for gay marriage because of a sea change in attitudes). In Iowa, often the answer was...\"I'm between Trump and Bernie...\" Or \"Hillary and Bernie\", but nary a \"either Clinton or Trump\". Not surprisingly Bernie ended up in a virtual tie with Clinton in Iowa, while in the general elections the results swung heavily in much of the Midwest for Trump.\n\nSetting aside policy, there's the authenticity factor, which Bernie, the senator with the highest approval ratings of any elected public official on the fed level, could have used to his advantage against a, perhaps, even more flawed challenger in Trump. Even discounting the many polls that showed Bernie with a 15 to 20 point edge over Trump in polling in May, Bernie was a sure fire bet with milenials (many of whom stayed home for the results), didn't carry Clinton's baggage (which caused a portion of the electorate to defect to Jill Stein in Michigan and Wisconsin) and was not the subject of FBI investigation, wiki hacks, etc. Blacks and Jews who heavily voted Clinton in the primaries and gens would likely have supported Bernie on fiscal and socially liberal matters...despite what would probably have ended up a constant barrage of ageism, anti semitism and mccarthyite insinuation about the commie black horse from Burlington, Bernie would have likely weathered the storms. His crowds would have rivalled Trump's...and CNN, MSnBC, etc, would have had a hard time choosing their winner, given that released wiki leaks docs show Clinton as the candidate with most favored status.\n\nMr Drum, statistical analysis works best under status quo conditions but this was a change election. \n\nFor proof, see Nate Silver's cocksure prediction of a 20%+ Clinton victory w/99% accuracy over Bernie in the Michigan primaries...\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n<blockquote>\"Always be closing.\"</blockquote>\n\nI'm hesitant to criticise candidates when I don't have all the facts that they had at the time, but if it's true that Ms. Clinton didn't campaign at all in Minnesota/Wisconsin/Michigan until the very end, I feel like that's a pretty serious oversight.\n\n\nPennsylvania was a bit more of a surprise given the polling there, but those 3 great lakes states were too close for comfort and jam-packed with White folks.  That means lying to pollsters about racist voting decisions.\n\n\nAs far as Bernie goes, I think it's a mistake to pretend that \"conservatives\" even care about conservative principles anymore.  They only care about attacking their neighbours, and they'll vote for <i>anyone</i> who promises to do that.\n\n\n\nThe GOP has become a death cult.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Here is my Cover Letter:\n\nThe Chinese, in conjunction with the fake news apparatuses and Merryl Streep, colluded to trick the world into believing this hoax that is global warming. If global warming was real, then surely more than the 1.5 billion people would have shown up to your bitterly cold inauguration - Yes, it is my opinion that I know there was a typo in your credible count. I also have evidence to prove that the Saturday following the inauguration was nothing more than millions, and possibly only a dozen according to alternative facts, of women and men worldwide who were \"cycling\" on the same day - Steve Bannon is working on creating this evidence now.\n\nUnder your authoritarianity I will \"Kelly-Ann Conway\", or subserviently and heedlessly follow, your every tweet to the letter of the law...in this case 140 letters. I'll ensure no website anywhere contains the words \"global warming\" by changing them to \"Thermal and Radiation Energy Entrapment System\", or TREES - trust me, it's totally different. To fight against TREES, which environmental scientists seem to hate so much, we can simply cut them down and use them to build our Mexican wall - made in America, built by Americans and paid for by Mexican currency, also called d\u00f3lar de los Estados Unidos. Early projections suggest we'll be able to employ at least 25 million people with this project, fulfilling another guarantee that you made. \n\nThen Mexico will finally talk to us about implementing a new Negotiation Agreement For Trump Adoration, or NAFTA, and nobody will demand your tax returns, because there won't be any more trees to make paper to print your taxes on. Print media will finally die, and we'll all have to watch TV to find out what's happening in America. Plus, the global gag rule won't have as much of an impact, since the poor and helpless around the world will just \"go away\" due to TREES. \n\nBest of all, I'm not a scientist or a member of the intelligence or intelligentsia community. In fact, I'm not even intelligent, so you know you can trust me. I leave my fate and the fate of this world in your more than adequately sized hands.\n\nLove,\nBill Pursell\n\nP.S.

It would certainly be in keeping with his litigious nature.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

(Not because of the kaboom, that was me being a kid with bigger ideas than talent with hand tools.)  Hydrogen gas is quite difficult to store long-term because it's molecules are so darned small they can leak through even a flawlessly-constructed container by slipping between the molecules that make up the container's walls.  You can liquefy hydrogen, which makes that less of a problem, but liquid hydrogen (LH2) is *frickin' cold* even in absolute terms and the insulation needed to keep it that cold adds a lot of weight and bulk.  NASA's doing a ton of work to make it easier to store LH2, because it's by far the most efficient rocket fuel we've discovered, but we've got a ways to go yet.\n\nThat said, ground storage might not be too bad if you don't expect to keep a batch around for more than a few hours... but the smoking lamp around those tanks is *definitely* out.\n\nAs for the article, it'll be interesting to see how the energetics prove out.  I know the US Navy's been developing something similar for their nuclear-powered aircraft carrier fleet; making your own jet fuel at sea would save them a lot of logistical hassles, and after all if you have a spare nuclear power plant lying around un-or under-used it's tempting to put it to work on solving that.\n\n -- Steve\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n<blockquote>\"hydrogen is a great fuel, except when it comes to storage.

(Not because of the kaboom, that was me being a kid with bigger ideas than talent with hand tools.)  Hydrogen gas is quite difficult to store long-term because it's molecules are so darned small they can leak through even a flawlessly-constructed container by slipping between the molecules that make up the container's walls.  You can liquefy hydrogen, which makes that less of a problem, but liquid hydrogen (LH2) is *frickin' cold* even in absolute terms and the insulation needed to keep it that cold adds a lot of weight and bulk.  NASA's doing a ton of work to make it easier to store LH2, because it's by far the most efficient rocket fuel we've discovered, but we've got a ways to go yet.\n\nThat said, ground storage might not be too bad if you don't expect to keep a batch around for more than a few hours... but the smoking lamp around those tanks is *definitely* out.\n\nAs for the article, it'll be interesting to see how the energetics prove out.  I know the US Navy's been developing something similar for their nuclear-powered aircraft carrier fleet; making your own jet fuel at sea would save them a lot of logistical hassles, and after all if you have a spare nuclear power plant lying around un-or under-used it's tempting to put it to work on solving that.\n\n -- Steve\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n<blockquote>\"it's aviation that imho will be stuck with synthetic fuel as the only option.\"</blockquote>\n\nDon't be so sure of that!\n\nBatteries are even sneaking into aviation now...\n\n<blockquote>\"Firms team up on hybrid electric plane technology\"</blockquote>\n\nwww.bbc.com/news/business-42152484\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You're shifting the Overton window.\n\nThe debate needs to be between reasonable ideas.  Anyone shrieking \"HOAX!\" needs to be shut out of the conversation entirely.\n\nCap and trade is at one end of that window!  I would still suggest it was a useful way to establish a price per tonne, and is obviously <i>better</i> than the status quo in places that have zero controls on carbon at all.\n\nEven more on target would be a debate between the <i>rebate</i> part of a carbon tax plan, and a <i>sequestration credit</i> part of a carbon tax plan.  I'm in favour of the latter, though I understand why the former is more politically palatable.\n\n<blockquote>\"A national, revenue-neutral carbon fee-and-dividend system (CF&D) would place a predictable, steadily rising price on carbon, with all fees collected minus administrative costs returned to households as a monthly energy dividend.\"</blockquote>\r\n\ncitizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Only the top 10% of grants are funded so you use every bit to talk about how your work is innovative, significant, and impactful (these are actual grant evaluation criteria). And it's getting worse, now the new NIH Biosketches are all about how your research has contributed to science ('Briefly describe up to five of your most significant contributions to science.'). Saying I failed to replicate prior findings on X, isn't exactly a valued contribution to science, but it's a vital step in scientific methods. Never mind that the 'I failed to replicate' paper would never be published anyway (not sexy enough).\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n...and <i>that,</i> my friend, is how science is done.\n\nI believe the children call what you just posted a <i>fatality.</i>\n\n<blockquote>\"Contributor name\nWANSINK, BRIAN: HUCK PAC, $500.00\nWANSINK, BRIAN: HUCKABEE FOR PRESIDENT, INC., $800.00\nWANSINK, BRIAN: HUCKABEE FOR PRESIDENT, INC., $1,500.00\"</blockquote>\n\nwww.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?two_year_transaction_period=2008&contributor_name=wansink&min_date=01%2F01%2F2007&max_date=12%2F31%2F2008\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You have no idea what the ten year old Rahmstorf paper is about.  Rahmstorf is rebutting noted denialist, Richard Lindzen.  The passage you attempt to twist is saying that if you limit climate forcings exclusively to CO2, a doubling of CO2 would lead to 1C global temperature increase.  But, that's meaningless because, for instance, water vapor exists.  And we've increased CO2 by just 45% so far and we're already 1C hotter than pre-industrial times.  What say you, NASA? <i>With latest update from @NASAGISS, 2018 is almost guaranteed to be the 4th warmest year in the record, and likely to be (~76%) the 4th year in a row more than 1\u00baC above the late 19th Century. (1\u00baC = 1.8\u00baF ~ \u00bc of an ice age unit)</i>\n\n2. Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is complicated which is why denialists think it helps them.  A recent paper tells us the ECS is likely between 2.4oC and 4.5oC (17-83% confidence interval), with a mode of 2.9oC and a median of 3.3oC. https://eartharxiv.org/4et67/.\n\n3. There is nothing in the abstract you link to which supports your statement.  And, the models and observed temperatures are quite close. https://twitter.com/ClimateOfGavin\n\n4.  Not sure what you think you're gleaning from an interview Jones did in 2010.  Maybe if you waved your hands harder.\n\n5.  The old, \"it's natural\" argument.  Jesus, we need a better class of denier round these parts.  Let's just look at your own cites, shall we?  \"The first and crucial piece of evidence is, of course, that the magnitude of the warming is what is expected from the anthropogenic perturbation of the radiation balance, so anthropogenic forcing is able to explain all of the temperature rise.... The second important piece of evidence is clear: there is no viable alternative explanation. <i>In the scientific literature, no serious alternative hypothesis has been proposed to explain the observed global warming. Other possible causes, such as solar activity, volcanic activity, cosmic rays, or orbital cycles, are well observed, but they do not show trends capable of explaining the observed warming.</i>\" Rahmstorf at p. 47.  \n\nIt is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. {10.3} <i>IPCC AR5, Summary for Policy Makers, D.3 Detection and Attribution of Climate Change at p. 15.</i>\n\nBut, what does extrememly likely even mean?  It means greater than 95% confidence.

You have no idea what the ten year old Rahmstorf paper is about.  Rahmstorf is rebutting noted denialist, Richard Lindzen.  The passage you attempt to twist is saying that if you limit climate forcings exclusively to CO2, a doubling of CO2 would lead to 1C global temperature increase.  But, that's meaningless because, for instance, water vapor exists.  And we've increased CO2 by just 45% so far and we're already 1C hotter than pre-industrial times.  What say you, NASA? <i>With latest update from @NASAGISS, 2018 is almost guaranteed to be the 4th warmest year in the record, and likely to be (~76%) the 4th year in a row more than 1\u00baC above the late 19th Century. (1\u00baC = 1.8\u00baF ~ \u00bc of an ice age unit)</i>\n\n2. Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is complicated which is why denialists think it helps them.  A recent paper tells us the ECS is likely between 2.4oC and 4.5oC (17-83% confidence interval), with a mode of 2.9oC and a median of 3.3oC. https://eartharxiv.org/4et67/.\n\n3. There is nothing in the abstract you link to which supports your statement.  And, the models and observed temperatures are quite close. https://twitter.com/ClimateOfGavin\n\n4.  Not sure what you think you're gleaning from an interview Jones did in 2010.  Maybe if you waved your hands harder.\n\n5.  The old, \"it's natural\" argument.  Jesus, we need a better class of denier round these parts.  Let's just look at your own cites, shall we?  \"The first and crucial piece of evidence is, of course, that the magnitude of the warming is what is expected from the anthropogenic perturbation of the radiation balance, so anthropogenic forcing is able to explain all of the temperature rise.... The second important piece of evidence is clear: there is no viable alternative explanation. <i>In the scientific literature, no serious alternative hypothesis has been proposed to explain the observed global warming. Other possible causes, such as solar activity, volcanic activity, cosmic rays, or orbital cycles, are well observed, but they do not show trends capable of explaining the observed warming.</i>\" Rahmstorf at p. 47.  \n\nIt is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. {10.3} <i>IPCC AR5, Summary for Policy Makers, D.3 Detection and Attribution of Climate Change at p. 15.</i>\n\nBut, what does extrememly likely even mean?  It means greater than 95% confidence.  Dr Gavin Schmidt explained that the IPCC\u2019s implied best guess was that humans were responsible for around  <i>110% of observed warming</i> (ranging from 72% to 146%), with natural factors in isolation leading to a slight cooling over the past 50 years. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-scientists-think-100-of-global-warming-is-due-to-humans\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n<blockquote>\"You well?\"</blockquote>\n\nI am!

There is very little attention one needs to pay to a solar panel once it's installed, and therefore very little <i>work</i> that needs to be done on that solar panel once it's installed.\n\n\nIf we were to have a massive renewable transition similar to Germany's Energiewende, we'd have a huge amount of jobs created at first, and once we had sufficient installed capacity, those jobs would tend to tail off.\n\n\nThere's a similar phenomenon at work with EVs.  They are freaking <i>indestructible.</i>  You don't need to hire a mechanic to fix a car that doesn't break.  The cretins running the auto manufacturing sector look at it as a major loss of revenue in <i>parts sales,</i> but there's a corresponding dropoff in demand for labour as well...\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Those panels are still producing energy today. What I've been confronted with for 35 years is how a major political movement destroys our institutions and mechanisms for governance and the other major political party calls what was destroyed a failure. Did the twin towers fail, or were they destroyed by terrorists flying planes into them? What percentage, even if a small one, could we produce right now that we are not because it doesn't solve the problem all at once? As for the sacrifices people are willing to make. The profits of the fossil fuel industry? The corporate welfare of Exxon and BP? The profits of private utility companies? State by state selling back to the grid has been outlawed. Rubes get ginned up on the swill sold to them by liars.  Be angry about a $5 light bulb that will last 10 times longer and use 1/3 the energy. But fox says be mad about the $5 dollars. We talk about the \"sacrifice\". The addled half wit is going to save 10 times more money. But who's going to lose it? The companies that would have sold 10 bulbs for a buck a piece instead of one for 5. The private utility that will make less money because we are using less energy (which wouldn't matter if it was a public utility) This entire exercise of combating climate change is the same inane excuses we've used for a generation to excuse the self dealing theiving social exclusionairies that have rotted us from the inside out. Let us keep starting from a point of contievence and running towards deceit. Its solved so much already.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n<blockquote>\"Macron wasn't hurting the people he was supposed to hurt.\"</blockquote>\n\n\nHeh heh heh...

Those panels are still producing energy today. What I've been confronted with for 35 years is how a major political movement destroys our institutions and mechanisms for governance and the other major political party calls what was destroyed a failure. Did the twin towers fail, or were they destroyed by terrorists flying planes into them? What percentage, even if a small one, could we produce right now that we are not because it doesn't solve the problem all at once? As for the sacrifices people are willing to make. The profits of the fossil fuel industry? The corporate welfare of Exxon and BP? The profits of private utility companies? State by state selling back to the grid has been outlawed. Rubes get ginned up on the swill sold to them by liars.  Be angry about a $5 light bulb that will last 10 times longer and use 1/3 the energy. But fox says be mad about the $5 dollars. We talk about the \"sacrifice\". The addled half wit is going to save 10 times more money. But who's going to lose it? The companies that would have sold 10 bulbs for a buck a piece instead of one for 5. The private utility that will make less money because we are using less energy (which wouldn't matter if it was a public utility) This entire exercise of combating climate change is the same inane excuses we've used for a generation to excuse the self dealing theiving social exclusionairies that have rotted us from the inside out.

It is their first amendment right to do so, and Americans should be clear about our intention to protect that right!\n\nThis is the only way to end their madness.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
