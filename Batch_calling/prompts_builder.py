    ### Overview ###

    Stance classification is the task of determining the expressed or implied opinion, or stance, of a statement toward a certain, specified target.
    Your task is to analyze the news comment, generate the main targets expressed by the user, and determine its stance towards the found targets. 
    A target should be the topic on which the comment is talking. 
    To help you in this task, you will be provided with a broader context where the comment happened. 
    You will have the title and body of the article, together with the time when the comment was posted. Also, if any, the news comment directly above the focal comment will be provided.
   
    ### Context ###
    {generate_context(article_title, article_body, parent_comment, oldest_comment, most_liked_comment, target_comment, comment_date)}

    ### Task Description ###

    1. Identify all the expressed targets from the user's comment. 
        - The targets can be a single word or a phrase, but its maximum length MUST be 4 words.

    2. For each target, determine the stance in the comment:
        2.1 Classify the Stance
            - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR.
            - If it is against the target, write AGAINST.
            - If it is ambiguous, write NONE - that means the user is clearly speaking about the topic but the stance is not clear. 
            
        2.2. Provide the stance type:
            - EXPLICIT: when the stance is directly stated in the comment
            - IMPLICIT: when the stance is implied but not explicitly stated

        2.3 Extract key claims
            - Extract the fundamental assertions or beliefs that form the basis of the commenter's stance
            - Each key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of "I agree with the following: <extracted claim>".

    ### Output Format: ###

    You must output only JSON format:
    {{
    "results": [
        {{
        "target": "<target description - maximum 4 words>", 
        "stance": "<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE]>", 
        "stance_type": "<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT]>",
        "key_claims": "<[ "I agree with the following: <extracted claim 1>", ...,"I agree with the following: <extracted claim 2>"]>",

        }},
