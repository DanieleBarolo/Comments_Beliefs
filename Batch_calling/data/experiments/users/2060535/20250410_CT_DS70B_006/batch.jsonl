They aren't about people being \"sensitive\".  I have PTSD because I did, and still do, work that exposed me to the risk and sights of severe violence and that most of the people complaining about trigger warnings would not be willing to do themselves (i.e. being a medic at protests).  And like I said, I volunteer as a rape crisis counselor.  The problem is not that I am \"sensitive\", the problem is that certain stimuli, <i>especially</i> if I'm not expecting them, can cause me to re-experience traumatic experiences - intense physical symptoms of fear or horror and rushing adrenaline, even full-blown panic attacks.  It's a medical episode.  It can throw off my emotional balance for hours, or days if it's bad enough, leaving me irritable and upset.  It has nothing to do with wanting to be shielded from the bad things in the world - I still do the work that I was doing when I got traumatized in the first place, but when I go into it <i>I know what might be coming</i> and that makes such a huge difference.  I have a chance to prepare myself.  I have a chance to check myself, make sure this is something I can really deal with at that time.  \n\nWith all the articles about trigger warnings lately, I'm getting really tired of hearing how weak and delicate I supposedly am to have triggers (or how I must be some ultra-privileged person who has triggers because I've been so oversheltered and didn't see enough pictures of the Holocaust or whatever growing up).\n\nTriggers are idiosyncratic, which I think is something that some people in the trigger warning movement, as you call it, miss.  For example, I have a friend who is triggered by all the movies of a particular famous director, because one of his movies was playing in the background when she was assaulted.  The Geek Feminism Wiki has a link to the account of someone who is triggered by calculus because she was studying calculus during the months that she was being repeatedly sexually abused.  I've talked to people who are triggered by taking showers because they were raped in the rain.  For a while I had a popular song as a mild trigger.  So yeah, you're never going to be able to account for all people's triggers.  People have weird triggers.  Anyone who has triggers, unless they are very new to the experience, is going to have done a fair amount of work learning what they are and how to manage them.\n\nHowever, actual depictions of the thing that traumatized them in the first place are very common triggers.  So you can address a lot of triggers by warning people about the obvious things!  Is it really so arduous for a prof to briefly mention \"Just so you know, this film that we're watching has a rape scene in it\"?  Binky, below, gives a fine example of how this can work with racist language, that would cover both people who would actually be triggered by it and people who would be sort of upset, while doing zero harm and posing zero threat to academic freedom.  It's just a courtesy.\n\nAre there people who are co-opting the notion of triggers, using them to mean \"Anything that upsets me\"?  Yep, and those people are annoying.  But you get that with everything - people saying that they have OCD because they are neat, that they are autistic because they are mildly socially awkward, that they have the flu because they have a cold.\n\nDoes real life have trigger warnings?  Well, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  Usually not worded as such, of course, but I don't routinely click on links to stories about police brutality that don't have \"police brutality\" or a similar indicative phrase somewhere in the title or URL.  Stories about rape usually have headlines or blurbs that make it clear what they're about.  Movies have a blurb on the back of the box that can give you some idea of what you're getting into, or you can read reviews.  Friends who have some idea of your past experiences will say \"Hey, there's a scene in this movie that you might have trouble with.\"\n\nIt's just a way to make things a little easier for people who have lasting psychological effects from trauma (or people with other psychological issues where episodes can be triggered, like other anxiety disorders or eating disorders).\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

So a warning about, say, rape, isn't going to cover everyone who's been traumatized by rape, but it'll cover quite a few.  You can't prevent all cases of people being triggered, but you can reduce them.  I talk about this some in my longer comment.

Fortunately, I'm in a field (in the physical sciences) where I'm unlikely to run into this in the classroom.\n\nIt might even work if students with documented PTSD, panic disorder, or similar, were able to register known triggers with the school disability office and trigger warnings on course material were their disability accommodation, but I don't know if any place is trying that approach.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I figure knowing how I'm likely to react to certain things and preparing myself, using the tools available, is a lot more responsible to myself and others than sticking my head in the sand about it and then melting down.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Sure.  But not very many.  That includes anarchists, by the way.  \"Anarchist\" and \"angry young guy who breaks windows\" are not the same thing (neither are \"black bloc\" and \"angry young guy who breaks windows\").  To the very limited extent that such a phenomenon exists, it doesn't usually happen in a vacuum - it gets going after people have already been hurt by the police and they are angry and bitter.  It's also geography-dependent, surprisingly so.\n\nI've seen at least as much police trying to provoke protesters as vice versa.  Possibly more.  As any experienced street medic knows, medic targeting is a great way for cops to provoke the angry young guys, who tend to be protective of medics, into doing something dumb.\n\nThere are an awful lot of us who have complained about the over-the-top police response to our protests, it's just that most mainstream liberals don't appear to care what happens to us (unless it happens at a college, like the Occupy UC Davis and UC Berkeley incidents).  In this sense it might be nice for the left to be a little more like the right.  If people don't agree, fine, but at least show some dismay about it and some sympathy for the victims' situation and the resulting mental health fallout, if not everything about their politics.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I realize that this is both sort of utopian and difficult to implement if you have, say, people coming from a bunch of different states to protest a summit.  I thought we actually did a solid job of it at my Occupy.  There were other things that we did not do a solid job with - I really don't want to come off like we were perfect, or The Best Occupy - but we created a community where I wasn't afraid that any regular, regardless of their dress or political ideology, might at any moment turn a nonviolent protest into something else.  The couple of times that there were people that I was worried about, I quietly mentioned them to friends (who also happened to be anarchists and in the black bloc) who went over and talked calmly with them.\n\nOne of the greatest self-policing things I have ever seen at a protest (not in my own city) was an anticapitalist march where a couple of hyped-up people decided that it would be cool to start climbing on the cars that were stopped in traffic, and a huge portion of the march started chanting in unison, \"Don't touch the cars!  Don't touch the cars!\" It worked great.  The people who were starting to be problematic stopped immediately.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They only did it because they were <i>provoked</i>, not because they were out to hurt.  But why don't you believe that they were out to hurt?  My experience with cops who decided to brutalize protests, in several different cities, is that they aren't doing it in a moment of confusion or lost temper, they're doing it out of malice, or on the orders of someone acting out of malice.  That doesn't mean that all cops, in those cities or in general, are malicious, just that the ones being violent <i>are</i>.  Aside from the actual brutality, I've had cops laugh at my patients with broken bones and internal bleeding (Chicago), mock me for being so gutless as to comply with their orders rather than get arrested (NYC), walk by me through an Occupy camp talking loudly about how much they were going to enjoy pepper-spraying people once they got to raid the camp (Portland), make misogynistic and homophobic comments to peaceful female marchers (Boston), and sneer at me while telling me that my medic markings weren't going to stop them from beating me the next morning (NYC).  Heck, in Chicago the police made \"We got up early to beat the crowds\" t-shirts in honor of the relevant weekend.  Why is it harder to believe that people like that want a fight than it is to believe that a few people throwing or spraying paint want a fight?\n\nYes, the Whole Foods property attack - which happened several days <i>after</i> the initial vicious destruction of the camp, and so cannot be the reason that the camp was attacked so violently - was stupid and destructive.  That doesn't mean that they caused the later brutality (which included the cops nearly killing another veteran, Kayvan Sabeghi).  That doesn't mean that \"anarchists\" want to fight with the cops, or that lefty protesters in the US wanting to fight with the cops is a major phenomenon.\n\nI have actually de-escalated a bad situation before - people being ready to turn on an outed plainclothes cop a couple of hours after a mass beating of protesters that hospitalized more than two dozen.  People were really really angry after what had happened earlier, and the guy needed to be escorted out safely so that everyone could calm down without anyone getting hurt.  In the case of the Whole Foods, I would probably not personally leave because as a medic I want to be around to help anybody who gets hurt.  But I agree that de-escalation is a wonderful thing to know how to do.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

The initial fierce camp raid that nearly killed Scott Olsen was on October 25.  If there was trash can burning, prior to November 2, I'm not aware of it, but it's possible.  The night of November 2 was the second major police crackdown, and there were at least a couple more over the next few months.\n\nOne thing that I did hear about at that time that may or may not be relevant - and I do not have the faintest idea of how this rumor got started - was that there was a rumor going around Occupy Oakland, including on November 2, that you could get rid of tear gas by burning tires in trash bins.  I know that this rumor was happening on November 2 because I was watching on livestream as a very nice Occupy Oakland media team member was getting interviewed by some news station, and he was asked about the fires, and said, approximately, \"Oh, they aren't trying cause any damage, that's to burn the tear gas out of the air,\" and my eyes widened and I said out loud \"What the &^@$?\"\n\nThe lack of police at the Whole Foods incident when there was so much policing during other parts of that same day actually does make me wonder about agents provocateurs.  Why would the police let that go when they were willing to crack down on other parts of the protest that day?  But I haven't argued that that must have been what happened because I don't think it's right for protests to just write off anything that goes wrong with \"Well it must have been provocateurs.\"\n\nI still don't buy your case.  There are so many left-wing protests that get attacked with no provocation at all.  I've seen right-wing protesters push the boundaries with no police response.  And your claim that we want it, even if most of us aren't provoking it, is frankly kind of insulting.  I mean, I'm one of the people who takes care of the protesters that get hurt.  I know so many people with major psychological problems because of police brutality.  I know people who have been physically disabled by it.  I know so many people who have complained and been largely ignored by Respectable Liberals.  It's not reasonable to say that a handful of people in Oakland, a city with its own very particular history and dynamics and culture, wanted a fight, so this is why leftist protesters around the country are treated worse than rightist ones.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And LGBTQ people experience much higher rates of violence as kids and have <a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/higher-risk-of-ptsd-for-gay-lesbian-bisexual-mostly-heterosexual-youth/\">much higher rates of PTSD</a> than straight cis people, and it's very common for people with PTSD to smoke to self-medicate.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I sometimes find riding the bus <i>annoying</i>, depending on which line it is - the 66 is often unreliable and the 70 is a carsick-making hellhole - but many other lines are completely fine, and shame wouldn't occur to me.  It's a bus.  The buses go places that trains don't, and people ride them to get to those places, what is shameful about that?\n\nMy suspicion would be that the popularity of the \"bourgeois\" bus is about it being high-frequency - always a plus - and <i>having a dedicated right-of-way</i>, which means that it <i>doesn't have to sit in traffic</i>.  It's not exactly a shocker that people will be more willing to take a high-frequency bus that doesn't have to sit around stuck in traffic, than a low-frequency bus that does.\n\n<i>I'd add the \"danger\" factor to the \"shame\" factor...[My friends] acted as if I'd \nliterally taken my life in my hands.</i>\n\nAm I being unfair to your friends if I suggest that we rename this the \"racism/classism factor\"?  Because in my experience when people talk about the dangers of public transit this is what they mean 90% of the time.  I'm willing to grant a few exceptions for women and trans/gender nonconforming people worried about excessive street harassment on public transit, because you tend to see excessive street harassment anywhere there's a critical mass of people out in public, but mostly it's about racism and classism, and Kevin's a cis man, so I kind of doubt their real question to him was \"weren't you worried about the street harassment?\"\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Trigger warnings are not there to say \"No one should read this book\" they are to help people who have experienced trauma to either be prepared for or avoid reading/watching/listening to something that will trigger memories of their trauma.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nNothing he said is about trigger warnings.  Trigger warnings aren't about censorship or being protected from different points of view, they're about providing a heads up that around certain topics.  They have been around (and debated) in the feminist blogosphere, and in a lot of fandom writing, for years - they weren't invented by Kids These Days, they're an import to academia from the Internet.\n\n\nI'm getting awfully tired of \"Can you tell me if you're going to show police brutality so that I don't have a flashback?\" (or someone else's version of something similar, whether it involves flashbacks or being put into some other bad mental state that's not helpful for engaging with the material) being interpreted, even by stodgier liberals, as \"I want to censor this, nobody should write or talk about it!\"  And even more tired of the \"coddling\" narrative - people typically get triggers either through trauma or through struggling with some major mental illness like an eating disorder or depression, and neither trauma nor illness suggests too much coddling in life.\n\n\nMicroaggressions are also not particularly related to trigger warnings, even if the same people often talk about both.  Microaggressions are just the little instances of getting shit for your race, gender, class, sexual orientation, etc, that happen often and thus add up to something more.  The Kids These Days didn't invent the word \"microaggression\" either (if anything, I'd guess someone in academia invented it, making it a bit rich for academics to act like it's a concept that's bad for academia).  I first heard the word years ago in a blog post from Female Science Professor, a physical science full professor, old enough to have an adolescent child, at a research university, who used to blog about science and sexism in science.  I doubt she invented it either.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

But then, my sample is skewed too.  I was a clinic escort for five years and have worked with an all-volunteer abortion fund (first as a case manager, then on the board) for more than six.  As a bit of anecdata, almost our entire abortion fund was born post-Roe.  I think there might be one or two exceptions.  And certainly, most clinic escorts that I've known have been born post-Roe.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

She makes the case that every few decades, and particularly after periods of feminist advancement, the anti-feminists react in a big way and start gaining power and control (voter suppression of young people and people of color doesn't help here, though I don't think it's the primary issue).  I think the way to deal with a backlash period is to fight all the harder.\n\nAs far as I know, there's no actual data on abortion activist demographics.  I can either argue from anecdote, as someone very active in the movement, or I can cite polling data, and you already correctly pointed out that supporting something in a poll question doesn't mean you'll actually fight for it.  I tried to go for a hybrid approach by combining anecdotes with a couple of pieces of data indicating that young women were highly present at a couple of major 21st-century actions.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And there's nobody interesting enough to me to receive their wisdom in 140 characters or less.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n\"Leftist hub\", eh? Doesn't Trump use Twitter to whine about how badly mistreated he is?\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI have no problem with some opt-in non-chronological feed as long as I get to keep my nice chronological timeline.\n\nWhen I'm acting as a medic at protests, I use Twitter to identify various kinds of threats or other situations that might require my attention (e.g. \"Angry counterprotesters are trying to start a fight at the back of the march,\" \"Police are raiding the hangout space and taking away the extra first aid supplies NOW,\" \"People who look like protesters are being detained on the subway near X and Y stations,\" \"I just saw a lieutenant handing gas masks to a bunch of cops in a staging area,\" \"Someone was hit by a car at the intersection of Foo and Bar Streets and there are no medics here\").  This has been extremely helpful to me at times for things like mitigating my own risk or finding people who need help.  A non-chronological feed kills this use.  For this use I need to see what is happening <i>when it is happening, in order</i>.\n\nThe rest of the time, well, I only follow people that I want to see stuff from.  Not all of us are media people who feel, AFAICT from listening to media people talk about Twitter, some kind of professional obligation to keep up with other media people.  If I'm not in a situation like the one described in the last paragraph it doesn't matter if I decide that I'm only going to scroll so far back and just ignore everything else I missed.  I already get the highlights and other engagement notifications on my phone to let me know if something significant is happening among the people I follow that I might be missing, and those are sometimes useful.\n\nSo I want to keep using Twitter in my preferred way and other people can use it in their preferred (or job-required) way.  I'm aware that some of the ways I use Twitter are VERY niche, so multiple options for \ndifferent kinds of uses seems like a fine idea as long as its not cover \nfor getting rid of the support for the ones that I care about.\n\nI have a friend who works for Twitter, and I've gotten the sense from her that they are aware they risk alienating their existing base if they actually switch to a non-chronological feed as opposed to supporting multiple options.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It's not uncommon among activists, IME, to use liberal as a slightly derogatory term similar in connotation to MLK Jr's \"white moderate\" in <i>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</i>, and for left activists, even those who don't use the term that way, to see liberalism as something that is left of the US center but to their right.  I'm not really endorsing those usages, but they exist and it's possible that Guy Andrew Hall and others in the thread are invoking them.\n\nIf you're defining liberal as \"left of center in a US context\" then absolutely, the grassroots activists are usually very liberal.\n\nUnrelatedly (and not in response to you, but a more general thing I'm noticing in this thread), LGBTQ rights were fought for by a lot of different LGBTQ activists, not just gay/lesbian ones.  Plenty of the people at Stonewall were trans and/or bi, and BTQ rights are still a work in progress just like LG rights are.  I realize that sounds overly pedantic to some of you but being an LGBTQ activist this is one of those things near and dear to my heart.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Half of them are sufficiently young that, if they're in college, they may not even have sought a \"permanent\" job yet.  Or finished accumulating student debt.  I mean, hell, one of my brothers is 18, starting college this fall, and I'm sure he's pretty optimistic about his prospects.\n\nOr maybe this is right and they actually are more optimistic.  I wouldn't have called that based on the people I know (except for maybe \"better off financially than parents\" for the techie side of my acquaintance, because software developers tend to be paid well), but that's a very limited sample.\n\n\nI'm laughing at the idea, further down in Luntz' report, that the 42% of 18-26 year-olds who aren't registered as Democratic or Republican are \"swing voters\" who are \"in play\" and that they couldn't possibly be part of the \"far left of the youth electorate\" (even as he notes how much they like Bernie Sanders).  Most of the people I would consider the far left of the electorate, youth or otherwise, are not registered with a major party.  Luntz is a Republican hack, but I thought he was smart enough to know the difference between \"not registered with a party\" and \"moderate.\"\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

My understanding - IANAL - is that that's a form of damages where you have to be pretty specific about what you're requesting for - lost wages, therapy bills, etc.  The jury can't just say \"Oh, I hate the defendant and want to nail them to the wall\" - that's what punitive damages, which haven't happened yet, are for.

You'd expect, though, that importing all these doctors would reduce MD wages in the US. There doesn't appear to be much evidence of that, which leads me to suspect that much of the reason other rich countries don't have more foreign-trained physicians is A) their medical wages aren't that high (so developed world* doctors have little incentive to move there) and B) they do a good job producing a domestic supply of doctors (in contrast to the US).\n\n*Sure, no country should be expected to reduce standards to the point where doctors trained in less rigorous systems should have easy entry.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nDean rightly has a hobby-horse about protection of highly-paid US occupations, IMO.\n\nOne of the AMA web pages points to a 2010 article in Health Affairs.  http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2010/08/04/foreign-trained-and-u-s-trained-doctors-provide-same-quality-of-care/\n\n<blockquote>Among the three groups (U.S. nationals trained in the United States, U.S. nationals trained abroad, and foreign nationals trained abroad), <b>patients of foreign-born international medical graduates had the lowest death rates</b>, while those of U.S.-citizen international graduates had the highest. In addition to patient death rates, the study looked at length-of-stay as a measure of quality of care. It found that patients of U.S. graduates had the shortest lengths-of-stay and the patients of U.S.-citizen international graduates had the longest. <b>The variance in length-of-stay between U.S. medical graduates and foreign-born international medical graduates was relatively small, indicating little practical difference between the two.</b>\n\n\u201cThese findings bring attention to foreign-trained doctors and the valuable role they have played in responding to the nation\u2019s physician shortage,\u201d said Norcini. \u201cU.S. medical schools are doing their part by expanding for the first time in thirty years, but <b>the number of graduate training programs has not increased proportionately.</b> If this continues, the current physician shortages will persist and the numbers of foreign-trained doctors will likely decrease significantly.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nForeign-born physicians have their patients die less frequently, have hospital stays that are just as short, but there are no increase in the number of graduate training spots.  That seems to indicate a cartel-like system that is keeping sufficient numbers of trained physicians out of the system to address the shortage.  In other words, the AMA and similar systems are protecting the incomes of their members.\n\nJust like Dean says.  ;-)\n\nAt least that's my take.  YMMV.\n\nCheers,\nScott.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"Walk into any software development shop...and try to find somebody who was born \nin the US, or even has a US passport.\"\n\nWhat?

Our gov is supposed to work for the people not for their big donors who control the government at our expense. It's because of people like Bernie that things will change now and it's because of people like you that things just get worse because you promote sitting on your thumbs and waiting at your own expense. So what your point is is that you need to sell your soul to get change which discredits your point that everything is so perfect here. The bottom line is our government is working for big money to exploit us while you are telling me that I should just wait around for things to change eventually by corrupt people who have no desire nor the backbone to stand up to their sponsors who control them. You are a status quo coward just like the rest of the people who are still waiting for change that will never happen because of cowards like you who try to dissuade us from the change we need now.\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYou have a very particular interpretation of Sanders' rhetoric.  I'm not sure why it's a more valid or obvious interpretation than \"We need to engage in mass mobilization to effect major sociopolitical change (and in the process, make the Democratic party social Democratic).\" Which, yes, that's hard, but it's not unprecedented.  And the level of success that Sanders <i>has</i> had, and the recent successes of non-electoral economic justice organizing (like Fight for 15), suggest that there are a lot of people, especially younger people, who care about and would work for economic justice goals.  I don't really see how this is more of a con than Obama's \"We are the ones we've been waiting for\" rhetoric (hey, did you know that most of the people hearing that are not going to be effecting much political change?), or for that matter, his rhetoric about uniting the country and breaking through partisan differences (hey, he's a smart guy, he should have known that <i>that</i> was never going to happen and stopped trying to con his supporters into thinking it was).\n\nYou're also echoing the common Clinton supporter condescension toward Sanders supporters, though you're at least being nicer about it than many.  Oh, those Sanders supporters are just young naive, impressionable kids who clearly don't know anything about political work.  The idea that they could have well-developed theories of change or well-thought-out reasons for supporting Sanders...impossible!  I mean, obviously there are plenty who do not, but that's true for every candidate's supporters.  Most <i>people</i> haven't spent a lot of time thinking about political work or theories of change.\n\n\n\nI can't quite tell if you think Sanders is actually unpragmatic as a politician, or you think he's a pragmatic politician who is making unpragmatic arguments to get votes.  If the latter, well, see first paragraph.  If the former, I don't agree with that.  Someone who has spent a couple of decades in Congress, who's been on numerous congressional committees (including as a chair and as a ranking member - he's the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, for crying out loud), who made a deal with Dick Durbin about supporting the Dems on procedural issues to get those committee assignments, who has made an art of hacking things he wants into bills through floor amendments, and negotiated to get his much-desired community health center expansion into the Affordable Care Act in exchange for his support - I would say that that's someone who's pretty pragmatic.  That's someone who has taken on a particular role and learned to play it well and to interact with other roles.\n\n\nYou're also setting up a false binary between electoral work and dropping out of social change work altogether.  Most social change work isn't electoral.  When I go into schools or community settings to teach people about consent, responding to sexual violence, or bystander intervention (I volunteer for my local rape crisis center), that's social change work that's not electoral.  Abortion funding and clinic escorting aren't electoral.  Impact litigation isn't electoral.  The efforts of Black Lives Matter have not primarily been electoral - there has been some electoral mixed in, along with lots of protest without which it would not have taken off or been sustained, data collection and policy wonkery, traveling to Geneva to testify before the UN, building black institutions, etc.  Union organizing is not electoral.  Obviously, all those things interact with electoral politics, but you could just as well say that electoral politics interacts with them.  Hell, your writing, and the larger project of Mother Jones' journalism, are not electoral work, and I assume you think, or hope, that they're making some kind of useful difference in the world.  \n\n\n\nIf you have three Sanders supporters, and one gets involved in their local Democratic precinct's regular activities and applies for a job on a congressperson's staff, one organizes a grad student employees' union at their college and joins their local chapter of Copwatch to try to deter police misconduct, and one goes back to being disillusioned and apolitical (which plenty of less practical Sanders supporters were pre-Sanders)...it's too bad about the third, but the first AND the second are politically productive outcomes, not just the first.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Negotiations continued even after July 7 \u2014 when Franken was sworn into office, and by which time Specter had switched parties \u2014 due to disagreements over the substance of the bill, which was still being drafted in committee, and because moderate Democrats hoped to win bipartisan support. Then, on August 25, before the bill could come up for a vote, Ted Kennedy\u2014a longtime healthcare reform advocate\u2014died, depriving Democrats of their 60th vote. Before Kennedy's seat was filled, attention was drawn to Snowe because of her vote in favor of the draft bill in the Finance Committee on October 15, but she explicitly stated that this did not mean she would support the final bill.[87] Paul Kirk was appointed as Senator Kennedy's temporary replacement on September 24.\n...\nMajority leader Harry Reid focused on satisfying the Democratic caucus's centrist members until the holdouts came down to Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat, representing Nebraska. Lieberman, despite intense negotiations with Reid in search of a compromise, refused to support a public option, agreeing to vote for the bill only if the provision were not included,</I>\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI do respect them.  I am aware that some people don't.  This seems very similar to the many mainstream Dems who don't respect protest politics and the people who do it, or don't perceive a lot of non-electoral activism in general (e.g. working with a rape crisis center or abortion fund, union organizing, college campus organizing around campus issues) as real political work.  But in reverse.  I can't count how many times I've heard mainstream Dem types assert that protest politics are glamorous and easy and that people who do them are naive and mockworthy at best, with very little idea of how the nuts and bolts of protest politics actually work.  I have also, many times, heard left-of-mainstream types act like if the people who crafted the PPACA had just used a little more energy we'd have a Canada-like system.  It would be nice if we could all respect each other's political work, and respect the idea of different roles being useful.\n\nOf course, pushing for more doesn't necessarily mean that you don't respect the work of the people who got what's already there.  We <a href=\"http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2016/04/should-black-lives-matter-compromise-no\">need both a robust protest politics and a robust legislative/electoral politics</a>, and within both of those, different people play different roles (the bridge between groups, the gadfly, the wonk).\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

These are largely things I've learned from volunteering as a rape crisis counselor and in other \"emotional first aid\" type roles, and some of them are things I've used in my own life.  Not all will be helpful for all people.  None of them are meant to suggest that the source of the problem is the person feeling the anxiety and stress; they are just meant to reduce the feeling, because the feeling can be very unpleasant.\n\n- Take five deep breaths, concentrating on keeping them even and not too fast (most resting adults take one breath every 3-5 seconds).  Find five emotionally neutral or positive things you see.  Take five more breaths.  Find five emotionally neutral or positive things you hear.  Take five more breaths.  Do the same exercise with touch, and actually touch the things if you can.  Take five more breaths.  In general, being mindful of breathing is really useful, because anxiety and hyperventilation reinforce each other (anxiety causes hyperventilation, hyperventilation causes shallow breathing which causes oxygen deprivation which causes anxiety, now you have a cycle).\n\n- If there's a smell or taste that you associate with safety, seek it out.  If it's something portable and you need to do this frequently, you can even carry it with you.\n\n- Pick a color and find everything in the room that has that color in it.\n\n- Play with something you can squeeze and twist - play-doh or silly putty, a stress ball, something like that.  Or something you can stretch and twist, like those rubber bracelets that every organization seems to give out these days.  The rubber bracelets are nice because they're small.  When I was on trial recently I took one to court with me every day, and when I was on the stand I was playing with one the whole time, both to reduce stress and to have something to do with my hands so that I wasn't fidgeting the whole time.\n\n- A lot of people like coloring.  They find the simple, repetitive motion calming.  Something like knitting might also work for this if you're experienced enough to find the motion simple.\n\n- Cardiovascular exercise is helpful for a lot of people.  Alternatively, just going for a walk can be helpful.\n\n- Processing with a sympathetic friend.\n\n- To break from a panic attack or something like that, some people find cold helpful - putting a cold pack against your skin, throwing cold water on your face, taking a cool shower, that kind of thing.\n\n- You're a tech guy.  There are a bunch of relaxation and de-stresssing apps, as well as mood-tracker apps that are meant to help people figure out what works for them, PTSD symptom management apps, all kinds of things.\n\nYou might also try googling progressive muscle relaxation, or having a therapist do it with you.  In general, therapists can be very useful for stuff like this, but I haven't emphasized that because several other people in this thread have done so already.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Here's an example from his interview with Seth Meyers last night:\n\n\"So what I would ask those people who voted for me, even if you have concerns about Clinton\u2014you don\u2019t like this aspect, I understand that\u2014but look at the hard issues that impact your life and your neighbor\u2019s life, and then think whether or not you want Donald Trump to become president.

It just doesn't seem possible to transmit that particular ugly truth without considerable pain, and boy are they going to get pain. \n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nWell the 5 seconds of research I did showed quite an extensive list of theoretical candidates from before the election (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_candidates,_2016). It's not like somehow the democratic bench was so bare bones that Clinton and O'Malley were the only reasonable democrats that could have run.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI would love it if Kevin actually reads this comment.  Then again, if I were him, I probably wouldn't read his comment section, especially not when it has 1100 comments.  So who knows whether he'll actually see it.\n\nKevin, I think you have the causation backwards on Bernie.  I canned an intended blog post that I was going to write about my relationship with the Democratic party because it would probably just contribute to the left circular firing squads.  But taking all my emotions and personal experiences out of it, the essence is that Bernie didn't convince people that Hillary and the Dems were too corrupt.  People who <i>already believed that</i>, of which millennials are probably a disproportionate fraction, were attracted to Bernie's candidacy, because it was the candidacy of a relative outsider who made a few noises about things that were already bothering them.  And those people already didn't like Hillary.  As it happens, despite not liking Hillary, I campaigned pretty heavily for her in New Hampshire, because my approach to national electoral politics is pretty hardline pragmatic.  I wasn't the only one either - more than half of my canvassing partners were Bernie primary supporters (and we held New Hampshire for her).  But I wasn't lukewarm in my personal feelings toward Hillary because of anything <i>Bernie</i> said!  I <i>already</i> didn't like her very much!  Anecdotally, my position in that regard is not a unique one.\n\nThis idea that anything that a small percentage of Bernie supporters did must have been because of something Bernie said is a weird one.\n\nIn addition, there's a percentage of Bernie's supporters - a small percentage, but disproportionately loud on the Internet, I think - that were only even touching the two-party system with a ten-foot poll because Bernie was running.  They were never going to vote for Hillary.  If you want to blame them for that, fine, but Bernie didn't do that, Bernie was just the candidate they were willing to make an exception to their usual \"Don't touch the major parties\" approach for.\n\nThere's also the thing everyone keeps forgetting - that some of the people who voted for Gary Johnson are right-leaners who would have voted Republican otherwise (like my dad and stepmom), not left-leaners who could have been Clinton votes.\n\nI'm a bit curious whether millennial third-party voting or non-voting was lower in swing-states.  I'm sure there were people who said \"Yeah, I can do this because I live in California, but I wouldn't do it in Florida.\"\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022China\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
