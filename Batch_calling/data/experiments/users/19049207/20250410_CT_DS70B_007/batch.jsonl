Should We Talk About Them Differently Now?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nHere's what I submitted.\n\nI have guns. At one time I kept them all loaded. Now I still have guns but none of them are loaded because we have grandkids and there is no telling when they might visit.\n\nBut when they do visit we talk about guns by breaking out the BB guns where I can teach them about guns and how to be safe with them. With no real danger. I also hunt with the two older grand sons.\n\nMy grandmother taught me how to be safe with guns and how to shoot them when I was eight years old. And the first thing she told me is guns kill. So you can never be careless with one. Not even once. Because it only takes a fraction of a second to pull that trigger whether you meant to or not and you can never take that fraction of a second back.\n\nAnd I talk about guns the way I always have and teach the same lessons. But at the same time is I am speaking out everywhere I can trying to get people to understand we have now reached a point where we have more \"gun rights\" than we have gun sense and responsibility to go with them.\n\nWhich means what we really need to do is change the way we see guns. Not something romanticized. Not some equalizer. Not an extension of your penis. We need to get back to understanding guns as a tool. A lethal tool.

Should We Talk About Them Differently Now?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nHere's what I submitted.\n\nI have guns. At one time I kept them all loaded. Now I still have guns but none of them are loaded because we have grandkids and there is no telling when they might visit.\n\nBut when they do visit we talk about guns by breaking out the BB guns where I can teach them about guns and how to be safe with them. With no real danger. I also hunt with the two older grand sons.\n\nMy grandmother taught me how to be safe with guns and how to shoot them when I was eight years old. And the first thing she told me is guns kill. So you can never be careless with one. Not even once. Because it only takes a fraction of a second to pull that trigger whether you meant to or not and you can never take that fraction of a second back.\n\nAnd I talk about guns the way I always have and teach the same lessons. But at the same time is I am speaking out everywhere I can trying to get people to understand we have now reached a point where we have more \"gun rights\" than we have gun sense and responsibility to go with them.\n\nWhich means what we really need to do is change the way we see guns. Not something romanticized. Not some equalizer. Not an extension of your penis. We need to get back to understanding guns as a tool. A lethal tool. And end the insane NRA propaganda that a gun is the answer to everything. And everyone should own one.\n\nAnd actually I think people who were raised with guns and still have them may be the best people of all to talk to people about guns.

One of the the advantages of a city -- or at least an east-coast city -- is, it's walkable; you don't NEED a car the way you do in the burbs.  When I lived in NY -- where BTW I didn't mind density or high-rises; in fact, <I>they're among the reasons I moved there</i> -- only about 50% of residents in the city (including outer boroughs) owned cars, and some (like me) didn't even bring them into the city.  Cars <i>aren't necessary</i> in a city, and by the way, traffic in dense suburbs (e.g., NJ, suburban Philly, suburban DC, suburban Boston, and also smaller cities) is often every bit as bad as in the city.\n\nAlso, NIMBYism is a problem pretty much everywhere and in all things.  Sure a city dweller doesn't want a high-rise going in next door, but neither does a suburbanite want a McMansion going in next door, or indeed ANY construction nearby.  And traffic is a universal complaint.  Even a small commercial development -- which might allow WALKING in the burbs (as strange a concept as that may sound) -- is met with complaints about there-goes-the-neighborhood AND traffic.\n\nPlus, economies of scale are real, and they don't stop at a million.  Plus also, \"critical masses\" of certain kinds of talent are next to impossible to build in smaller cities.

Since then Trump has continued to say mass shootings are a \u201cmental-health problem,\u201d not a gun problem.\" ...... http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/every-attempt-to-change-gun-laws-under-trump.html\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n<blockquote>The field has long faced a major challenge with so-called bystanders who may have a bad gut feeling about someone\u2019s behavior but were reluctant to seek help from authorities. That problem is reiterated by the new research: Concerned bystanders only notified law enforcement in 41 percent of the emerging cases.</blockquote>\n\n\nThere are two problems. First, there's a lack of institutional trust. I'm not going to call the cops on a suspicion, only to see them come out and gun down my neighbor within 70 seconds of arriving.\n\n\nSecond, the message to \"see something, say something\" reaches far more irrational people than rational ones. Instead of a few calls about real threats, you wind up with people calling the cops when non-white people \"don't look right to me.\"\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLike Cho at Virginia Tech?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I had no power for 5 days. I survived.\n\nFirst things first.  The local beach communities do NOT want to force those million dollar homes from the beach front.  Why?  Because they pay a large amount in property taxes.  Any beach community that says otherwise if fooling themselves.\n\nSecond - the Federal Government now provides the flood insurance that used to be provided by private industry. Yes the program is Administered by private insurers but the risk is assumed by anyone paying taxes to the Federal Government.  So yes, that little old lady with a small farm in Indiana is supporting those wealthy enough to build those waterfront homes through her taxes.  Why is it that private insurance companies pulled out of the flood insurance  program?  After all, according to conservatives private industry does every thing BETTER than the Federal Government.  The answer is simple.  The insurance companies accepted global warming, along with the associated sea level rise, and decided that no  matter how high the premiums it posed too much risk for them, and their bottom line.  It wasn't a political decision, it wasn't a liberal CEO decision but it was clearly based on money.  so now their profits are guaranteed through the administrative fees imposed in applying the Flood Insurance Program for these homeowners.   This is a sham and a travesty and must stop.\n\nThird - WE are stupid people. We think we can beat back Mother Nature.  Home designers tell beach front property owners that they can limit the damage from storms with walls on the bottom and first living floor that blow out when water comes through protecting the home from being totally washed away.\n\nIt is time.  Time admit that all the money in the world won't stop this devastation from happening.  Hard decisions have to be made. You want a beach front home?  You are on your own for insurance.  You want to ride out the storm?  Don't expect a rescue until the storm passes.  Towns have got to find other sources of revenue. \n\nThat leaves river flooding.  Unfortunately, the same rules may have to apply based upon the topography of the land.\n\nIts a tough subject, that's for sure\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI live in Wilmington North Carolina.

It wasn't a political decision, it wasn't a liberal CEO decision but it was clearly based on money.  so now their profits are guaranteed through the administrative fees imposed in applying the Flood Insurance Program for these homeowners.   This is a sham and a travesty and must stop.\n\nThird - WE are stupid people. We think we can beat back Mother Nature.  Home designers tell beach front property owners that they can limit the damage from storms with walls on the bottom and first living floor that blow out when water comes through protecting the home from being totally washed away.\n\nIt is time.  Time admit that all the money in the world won't stop this devastation from happening.  Hard decisions have to be made. You want a beach front home?  You are on your own for insurance.  You want to ride out the storm?  Don't expect a rescue until the storm passes.  Towns have got to find other sources of revenue. \n\nThat leaves river flooding.  Unfortunately, the same rules may have to apply based upon the topography of the land.\n\nIts a tough subject, that's for sure\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nTypically in the Midwest when flooded out and Insurance pays when in a floodplain, if you want to remain at that location, you have to mitigate future flooding by elevating the house higher than the base flood level, or move it to a higher location.\n\nIf that has no appeal, tough. You then get to demolish, and buy a different house elsewhere\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I don't get why WaPo dropped the story about Thomas just because he'd been sworn in. Isn't impeachment an option? Maybe they knew they couldn't get a majority vote to do so. Just like we're unsure about Kavanaugh. But really, if these people don't have ulterior motives or some other agenda, what's the harm in waiting until a full investigation is done? Why wouldn't they want an honest person as SCOTUS? Oh wait...don't answer that.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI still believe that the angry old white guys are making a really stupid mistake by pushing ahead with the confirmation of a nominee who's clearly unfit to serve on the SCOTUS and who's galvanizing women voters to rise up and oppose republicans all across the country. \n\nIf they were much more clever and much less stubborn, they'd see that the the astute political move would be to (a) allow Kavanaugh's nomination to fail, (b) use the whole nasty debacle as an electoral cattle prod to get their brain-dead base to the polls to protest the democrats' \"con job\", and then (c) nominate another activist loon from the Federalist Society list. \n\nIt's not like there's a shortage of ultra right wing jurists out there.

The only way for high-speed rail to succeed is if it works with the transit system, never as a standalone construction. It is very much intended to complement and support other systems.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nChina can do more, because anyone who tries to NIMBY gets reeducation  on why that makes them Enemies of the State.

The project yielded 14 prosecutions, representing 0.000017 percent of the votes cast. (There were only four voters convicted for misdemeanors, three were republicans)\n\n(2) The National Association of Secretaries of State, which represents most of the nation's top election officials (many of whom are Republicans), released a statement saying, \u201cWe are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by President Trump.\u201d\n\n(3) Trump's assertion of widespread voter fraud contradicts statements by his campaign's own lawyers, who stated unequivocally that \u201call available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.\u201d The statement was made in a filing opposing Jill Stein's recount efforts in Michigan.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/25/here-are-nine-major-investigations-on-voter-fraud-that-found-virtually-nothing/?utm_term=.edc2e3a7a41b\n\nThe republicans know that voter fraud is a myth.

Anyone?\n\nThat's right: Zero. Zip. Nada. Not one.\n\nCote d'Ivoire had all the legal frameworks in place. The minimum age for work is 16. The minimum age for dangerous work is 18. Education is compulsory through age 16.\n\nAnd Ivorian authorities have absolutely no intention of implementing those policies. While there is some degree of trafficking going on, the vast majority of children slaving away in Cote d'Ivoire, and around the world, have been placed there by their caregivers. There's only so much outsiders can do in that environment.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n'Although the lawsuit notes that Nestl\u00e9 and Cargill do not own the cocoa farm where the children were abused......\"\n\nThat's a very convenient relationship.

People have talked themselves out of an overdose a few pills in. One trigger pull, it\u2019s done. If you survive a gunshot to the head, you\u2019re pretty much dead anyway. \nAs for the accidental... less guns= less accidents.\nBtw, the presence of a gun increases the severity of crimes. This study has \nbeen done. They compared US cities to their equally sized peers. Some like London even larger than any US city. They found that rates of interpersonal crimes ( theft, burglary, assaults, etc) were actually similar across the board. But. In the US, you were exponentially more likely to end up DEAD because there are so many guns here. An argument in France over a parking spot MIGHT end up in a fist fight. In Florida it ends up with somebody dead or maimed.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnd Knives.

If you survive a gunshot to the head, you\u2019re pretty much dead anyway. \nAs for the accidental... less guns= less accidents.\nBtw, the presence of a gun increases the severity of crimes. This study has \nbeen done. They compared US cities to their equally sized peers. Some like London even larger than any US city. They found that rates of interpersonal crimes ( theft, burglary, assaults, etc) were actually similar across the board. But. In the US, you were exponentially more likely to end up DEAD because there are so many guns here. An argument in France over a parking spot MIGHT end up in a fist fight.

NONE.  AT ALL.  And since there was no attempt made, the Russians could not have attempted to help President T win.  But even if they did, so what?  We've interfered with the elections of lots of other countries, so it's okay when someone does it back to us (as long as it helps a Republican win, of course - otherwise it's librocommiefascism!)\n\nAnd even if it did happen, and even if people from President T's inner circle shared polling and demographic data with the Russians, that's not collusion.  And even if it is, collusion isn't a crime anyway (unless it's done by CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON, who totes colluded by the way, and should be locked up).\n\nAnd anyway, the Mueller report TOTALLY EXONERATED President T of any and all wrongdoing, so it would be pointless for the Dems to subpoena the report anyway.  They have Barr's completely trustworthy summary, which should be more than enough.\n\nThese are the alternative facts.  They cannot be refudiated or dispudiated.

The 1,336 lb (606 kg) urea nitrate\u2013hydrogen gas enhanced device was intended to send the North Tower (Tower 1) crashing into the South Tower (Tower 2), bringing both towers down and killing tens of thousands of people. It failed to do so but killed six people and injured over a thousand.\n\n\nThe attack was planned by a group of terrorists including Ramzi Yousef, Mahmud Abouhalima, Mohammad Salameh, Nidal A. Ayyad, Abdul Rahman Yasin, and Ahmed Ajaj. They received financing from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,Yousef's uncle. In March 1994, four men were convicted of carrying outthe bombing: Abouhalima, Ajaj, Ayyad, and Salameh. The charges includedconspiracy, explosive destruction of property, and interstate transportation of explosives. <i>\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Then they need to get this going, ASAP. There is no good reason to wait at this point. You can't wait for the public's approval for impeachment hearings to begin. The public needs to SEE impeachment hearings in action to realize how corrupt trump is.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n48 hours ago I was firmly on the fence about impeachment because I was concerned about (a) riling up Trump voters for 2020, (b) dividing the democratic party ahead of the elections, and (c) risking so much for a purely symbolic act that the republicans in the Senate will never vote to uphold. But after hearing and reading all the arguments in the MSM and here on this forum. I no longer think the obvious political risks of undertaking impeachment proceedings are sufficient reason to not move ahead. \n\n(1) Impeachment is about more than removing a sitting president. It's about defending the presidency from a man who is without a doubt the most dangerously corrupt and deranged man to ever hold the office. Even if he remains in office, he must be exposed.\n\n(2) It's about showing the American people in excruciating detail just how cowardly and feckless the GOP has become in their mindless defenses of Trump's lies, his crimes and his traitorous behaviors. Even though the Senate will never vote to impeach, make each and every republican Senator stand up and defend their votes.\n\n(3) t's about drawing a line in the sand and putting a stop to the ongoing assaults on our system of government that can only lead to an even more badly damaged and diminished republic, and to the rise of a right wing totalitarian government.\n\n(4) And for the democrats, it's about honoring the same demands they've been making of the GOP for many, many years to \"put country before party.\" They need to \"leave it all on the field\". \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLdtG7KZvw\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLying under oath is more crime than what Cheeto's underlings signed plead deals for.\n\nBubba did commit a crime.

Family living expense is not replaced so you are in debt for that also. Every time you use the insurance you insurable yield is lowered by that amount. Fields are insured on individual plots, a poorly performing field may be uninsurable.\n\n\nIn my area the EPA already mandates how and how much fertilizer is applied. Farmers can no longer use liquid nitrogen and the dry fertilizer has to be applied in three separate stages instead of just two larger amounts. If more stringent control is warranted combines can be equipped with yield monitors and GPS so the poor performing areas can be mapped.

In less that two minutes I found \"America\" as a meaning the \"United States\" in the Federalist papers and in an 1818 letter of by John Adams. I would have searched for more examples but it seemed rather silly: America has been the common shorthand for the United States since its inception.  In the late 1970's  I first heard the idea that, somehow, the term should apply to all inhabitants of the Americas. This idea came from well-meaning  Americans with less than perfect understanding of how languages work and and even less understanding of the feelings of people of other nations. I would suggest due caution before walking into a working class bar in Toronto and loudly announcing that all the patrons are really Americans.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nIt also confuses the TRUMPIANS, who don't realize, that those are Americans trying to get to the \"United States\" for Asylum. \ud83d\ude0f\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nStill not seeing proof that they talked about it\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
