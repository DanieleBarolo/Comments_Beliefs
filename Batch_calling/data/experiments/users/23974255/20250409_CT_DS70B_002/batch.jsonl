Hannah and her older sisters, Mary Alice, Emily, Edith, and Martha, as well as her younger ones, Jane, Elizabeth and Rose Olive, loved it when he came to call.  Hannah would tell them how Frank was sweeping her off of her feet and how much she would love to marry him.  This is his Quaker side and courting was taken very seriously. \n\nRichard Nixon is a distant cousin of mine on my dad's side.  We share 6th great grandparents, Ben and Lydia (Roberts) Mendenhall.  I think all the Mendenhalls were Quakers, even back in Mildenhall, England.  In fact, we go back to Col. Thomas Ballard, who founded Yorktown PA and donated (for $1) all of the land that serves as William and Mary College.  Another Mendenhall named Jamestown after his dad, James Mendenhall.  So sentiment and love of each other run high in our line.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\ndont forget Hitlary was involved too.The left likes tp portray Nixon as \"the most hated President of all time\" but they seem to forget he was elected by huge majorities twice.He wasnt the best president ever, but he was no obama thats for sure.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\nAbraham Lincoln....\n\n\"\"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\"\nThe idiots in DC are doing their best to destroy it !!!!!!!!!!!\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\njust remember, all real Americans support you and what you are doing.my nephew just got back from Afghanistan thanks and God bless.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

REPUB MCs see the women's march and they want to hide in their \"water closets.\"\n\nMany REPUBs MCs look at the numbers and try to figure out how they can \"walk the line.\"\n\nImho, no matter how large \"the rift\" grows, many REPUB MCs will try \"to reach across the aisle\" to reach a \"bi-partisan solution.\"\n\nWhich is why Planned Parenthood is still funded, notwithstanding REPUB Leadership promises to cut such funding. Let's face it: Speakers Boehner and Ryan did nothing.
