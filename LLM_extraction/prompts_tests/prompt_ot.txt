    Stance classification is the task of determining the expressed or implied opinion, or stance, of a statement toward a certain, specified target.
    Your task is to analyze the news comment, generate the main targets expressed by the user, and determine its stance towards the found targets. 
    A target should be the topic on which the comment is talking. 
    To help you in this task, you will be provided with a broader context where the comment happened. 
    You will have the title and body of the article, together with the time when the comment was posted. Also, if any, the news comment directly above the focal comment will be provided.

# News comment title:
Support for Gun Control Plummets In Wake of Navy Shooting

# News comment article:
In apollreleased Friday, Rasmussen reports that support for gun control is plummeting as opposition has risen. The poll was taken in the wake of Monday’s horrific Navy Yard massacre, and yet only 44% of those polled believe stricter gun controls are necessary-the lowest number in a year. A full 50%, however, believe that more gun laws arenotnecessary. Overall, only 33% believe increased gun control laws would have stopped the Navy Yard murders.This is a startling turn of events, not only when you consider the media furor surrounding the recent mass-shootings, but that the mainstream media literally spent months in a relentless lobbying campaign to erode Americans’ Second Amendment civil rights. The media worked as hard to get control passed as they did to get Barack Obama elected and re-elected, and yet they have been trounced on this one.It is obvious now that a sustained, months-long media push that involved every trick in the book simply didn’t work. The media threatened the jobs of politicians, attempted to demonize the NRA, and flooded the airwaves with emotional blackmail.And yet, using alternate media, the other side’s argument has won out.The media should worry when they go all in and lose so decisively.Follow  John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC

Yes. They should.

But they don't care and they are shameless for being liars, just like Obama.

    ### Task Description ###

    1. Identify all the expressed targets from the user's comment. 
        - The targets can be a single word or a phrase, but its maximum length MUST be 4 words.

    2. For each target, determine the stance in the comment:
        2.1 Classify the Stance
            - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR.
            - If it is against the target, write AGAINST.
            - If it is ambiguous, write NONE - that means the user is clearly speaking about the topic but the stance is not clear. 

        2.2. Provide the stance type:
            - EXPLICIT: when the stance is directly stated in the comment
            - IMPLICIT: when the stance is implied but not explicitly stated

        2.3 Extract atomic arguments
            - Extract the fundamental claims or beliefs that form the basis of the commenter's stance
            - Each atomic argument should represent a distinct, underlying assertion or value judgment
            - Focus on capturing the substance of WHY they hold their position, not just WHAT position they hold
            - Good atomic arguments reveal generalizable beliefs (e.g., "Government spending benefits the wealthy" rather than "This policy costs money")
            - Avoid simply repeating comment text; instead, distill the core reasoning principles expressed
            - Examples:
                • From "Politicians always lie about helping the middle class" → "Politicians are dishonest about economic policies"
                • From "This healthcare plan just creates more bureaucracy without helping patients" → "Healthcare reform increases bureaucracy" and "Healthcare reform fails to improve patient care"

    ### Output Format: ###

    You must output only JSON format:
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "target": "<target description - maximum 4 words>", 
          "stance": "<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE]>", 
          "stance_type": "<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT]>",
          "explanation": ["atomic argument", "atomic argument", ...]
        },
        // Repeat for each target expressed by the user's comment
      ]
    }

    ONLY return the JSON object itself.
