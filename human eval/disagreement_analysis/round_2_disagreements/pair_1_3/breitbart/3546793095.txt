Trump has been trying to help protect us from this and liberals have overuled him at every step.

The Sudanese immigrant who shot up a White Christian Church in Tennessee, now we see this horrific attack.

You liberal sanctuary city appeasers are to blame for this carnage!

The 9th Circuit should feel proud they stopped our President from protecting our homeland.

Sickening!!

            Hey tough guy! I'm gonna let you in on a little something. The correlation between receiving upvotes and making sense or producing strong arguments (read: postings) on Breitbart is completely unrelated. For instance, your recent post: "Look another idiot Troll" received 12 upvotes. I mean, it's a punishingly worthless post and it received 12 upvotes. Now, if Einstein were to rise from the dead and post his Theory of Relativity on Breitbart he would render effectively zero upvotes because 1) you bareheaded numbskulls wouldn't have clue what the hell he was talking about and 2) you'd call him a big-mouth Ashkenazi troll. So you see, receiving upvotes is an indication of higher levels of active stupidity, completely contradictory to general understanding. Bonne journee!

              You get no upvotes for that post.

                That's my mission. No upvotes is an indication that you actually "possess" a modicum of intelligence in your goddamn brain. Hence, I'm doing the right thing. Good day!

                  Update: Now we hear that ME MUslims are taking credit for Vegas shooting. Seems that the shooter converted to Islam and joined ISIS (Muslims). MSM covered up last weeks Muslim shooting at an  Antioch, TN church that killed 4 and injured many more... but they will have a hard time covering this one up.
