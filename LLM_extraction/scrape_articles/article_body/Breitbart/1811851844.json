{"title": "Bob Woodward: History Books Will Blame Obama for Shutdown's Effects", "body": "Bob Woodward: “[Obama] said he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling. A reasonable position. ‘I will not be blackmailed,’ he said. But he should be talking. They should be meeting, discussing this, because as I think Steve Ratner showed earlier, the American economy is at stake and the president, if there is a downturn or a collapse or whatever could happen here, that’s bad, it’s going to be on his head. The history books are going to say, we had an economic calamity in the Presidency of Barack Obama. Speaker Boehner, indeed, is playing a role on this. Go back to the Great Depression in the 1930s. I’ll bet no one can name who was the Speaker of the House at the time. Henry Thomas Rainey. He’s not in the history book; it’s on the president’s head. He’s got to lead. He’s got to talk. And the absence of discussion here, I think, is baffling element.”", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2013/09/30/Bob-Woodward-Blasts-Obama-History-Books-Will-Blame-Him-For-Not-Leading"}
