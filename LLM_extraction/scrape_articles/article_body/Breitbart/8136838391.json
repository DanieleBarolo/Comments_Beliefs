At 1:45 a.m., Federal Police Officers once again were forced to disperse the crowd west from the building. During the dispersal, a large fire was started in the middle of Lownsdale Square.Portland Police did not respond to any of the incidents and made no arrests.Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, has defended the presence of federal law enforcement in the city.“If you did your job from a local perspective, we wouldn’t be there,” hesaidTuesday. “What we have in Portland is very different than what we have in any other city.”Despite that, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) has remained obstinate.
