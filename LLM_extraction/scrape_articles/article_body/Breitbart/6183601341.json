John Kasich (R-OH) said President Donald Trump’s tweets about the response to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria were “not appropriate.”Kasich said, “Well, it’s not appropriate. When people are in the middle of a disaster, you don’t start trying to criticize them. I don’t know what to say. It’s just not the way that I think it ought to be handled. It’s not the way that we handle disasters here. I mean, they’re challenging. You have to get it right. And we’ve watched people who were leaders, I think, Governor Scott down in Florida did a terrific job warning. You just don’t get into who’s bad or who’s good, no matter what they say. You have to ignore it and be bigger than the nonsense.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter@pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/10/01/kasich-trumps-puerto-rico-tweets-not-appropriate-bigger-nonsense/"}
