And like Scotland, Catalonia’s borders were drawn by centuries-old agreements and conflicts, later maintained and reinforced by 20th-century post-war politics.Unlike Scotland, the northeast region of Spain is not recognized as a separate country cooperating in a union, rather it is legally considered a part of, and is taxed and controlled by, Madrid, with virtually no influence over its own laws. This proves especially frustrating for Catalans as their region generates a significant portion of both Spain and Europe’s economies.""The size of the Catalan economy — 19% of GDP and 26% of Spanish exports — means it is systemically important, or risky, within Spain, in the same way Spain — as the fifth largest European economy — is within Europe,"" explains the Spain Report in an editorial published the day before the Scottish referendum.""If the Catalan question becomes problematic for Spain, Spain will become problematic for Europe, at the same time as Europe attempts to deal with the ramifications of the Scottish question, whichever way Scots vote tomorrow.""""Catalonia’s not Spain,"" former resident Kaitlyn Delaney explained to UPI. Delaney moved to the region in 2012 from the United States to teach English. After a year, she relocated to the main country.""[Catalans] have a different culture and language — everything from their business to their lifestyle is different from Spain.""A week prior to Scotland’s vote, Catalans took to the streets of Barcelona to celebrate their National Day, forming a massive 7-mile-long ""v"" for ""vote,"" in the hope of drawing attention to their own feelings of unrepresented occupation.""It’s very important that Sept. 11 be a big success [to] pressure the Catalan government to hold the referendum,"" Carme Forcadell, head of the Catalan National Assembly, Catalonia’s largest pro-independence group, told the Wall Street Journal.Foreign Minister JosÃƒ © Manuel GarcÃƒ ­a-Margallo dismissed the separatist notions, warning, ""The only thing the government can do is use all the means at its disposal … only the law, but the full force of the law.""GarcÃƒ ­a-Margallo went on to caution Scottish independence would set ""an unlawful precedent.""""[The Spanish government] shouldn’t think that with this they will stop the course of history,"" countered Catalonia Regional President Arthur Mas.""[Thursday’s vote] means hope that nowadays freedom is possible,"" Catalonia native Joel Canyigueral echoed to UPI. Despite increased optimism, Canyigueral cautioned only history will determine the impact of Scotland’s potential independence on the region.""[Scottish independence] is important but it won’t really mean anything here unless Catalonia becomes free."""
7056230901,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2012/03/23/october-baby-faith-reviews/,NY Times,"“Oh, the horror.” No, this is not an homage to Francis Ford Coppola and “Apocalypes Now”; it’s the reaction ofNew York Timesfilm reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis to the pro-life movie “October Baby.” On the verge of mild hysteria,Catsoulis writes:More slickly packaged than most faith-based fare, “October Baby” gussies up its anti-abortion message with gauzy cinematography and more emo music than an entire season of “Grey’s Anatomy.” But not even a dewy heroine and a youth-friendly vibe can disguise the essential ugliness at its core: like the bloodied placards brandished by demonstrators outside women’s health clinics, the film communicates in the language of guilt and fear.Catsoulis is a bridled leftist; she makes her sympathies clear but seems to make sporadic efforts at even- handedness. Witness her review of “The Iron Lady,” the biopic of Margaret Thatcher starring Meryl Streep:[T]his demeaning biopic of Margaret Thatcher reduces one of the 20th century’s most important political figures to a bossy, intractable scold. . .Watching it, you would never know she was a strong-willed beacon for many young British women who aspired to more than housekeeping and child-rearing: Even when we loathed her policies, we could not help but long for her spine.But the leftist venom sometimes does occasionally burst forth, as when she vilified Ben Stein’s documentary “Expelled” as “an unprincipled propaganda piece…One of the sleaziest documentaries to arrive in a very long time …”So what do “Expelled,” a documentary that championed Intelligent Design, and “October Baby,” a film that decries abortion, have in common?Religious faith. That’s what makes leftists like Catsoulis crazy. What they see as attempts at inculcating guilt and fear are, in reality, attempts to forward a message about the goodness of faith. The left may attempt to play movies like “October Baby” as a war on women, but in reality, the reviewers have declared a war on religion."

It borders on pedophilia. Sadly, this is just the latest example of the overt sexualization of young girls in entertainment,” PTC President Tim Winter said.The McKinley High ladies definitely vamp it up for the camera. On the cover, Monteith is flanked by both “Glee” divas — including a pants-less Michele and a scantily clad Agron — with his hands squarely on their bottoms. In other shots, Michele can be seen posing in tiny underwear and thigh-high socks, sucking on a lollipop by a set of lockers, and in another scene, perched on a bench with her legs spread-eagle. Agron dons a thigh-grazing skirt and belly-baring T-shirt as she thrusts pom-poms in the air in one picture. In another photo, the girls hit the library in skimpy outfits and throw books around the room.The PTC also charged that the racy photos disproportionately focus on the ladies’ sexuality while Monteith spends a lot of the shoot fully covered up in jock-chic looks.Full article ishere."

They ride to a lake, where he convinces her to strip off her tight leather jumpsuit and jump in the cold water.One of his generation’s most influential and prolific musicians, Prince died suddenly on April 21 at the age of 57 at his Paisley Park estate outside Minneapolis.The cause of death is not yet known.The June 29 auction will also include costumes from Britney Spears, Katy Perry and Alicia Keys, as well as a glove inlaid with Swarovski crystals that Michael Jackson wore during his “Dangerous” tour in 1992.Prince’s death has revived interest in his work and “Purple Rain” is currently showing in more than 150 theaters in the United States. The movie won Prince an Oscar for best soundtrack.His next two films, “Under the Cherry Moon” (1986) and “Graffiti Bridge” (1990), were flops that ended his screen career.Prince also co-directed the concert documentary “Sign o’ the Times” (1987)."
7059040258,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2013/04/09/streaming-revolution-fox-television-threatens-to-go-off-the-air/,Streaming Revolution: Fox Television Threatens to Go Off the Air,"The slow-motion streaming-television revolution continues with a device called Aereo, which allows consumers to stream any local television station already available over their airwaves. This includes what is known as the Big Four: ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.After winning a major court battle last week, Aereo has Fox Television so freaked, the network is considering becoming a cable channel, which would mean yanking their broadcast fromthe public airwaves:At the National Association of Broadcasters’ annual trade show on Monday, Carey, the News Corp. president, said, “We will continue to aggressively pursue our rights in the courts, as well as pursue all relevant political avenues, and we believe we will prevail.”Carey added: “One option could be converting the Fox broadcast network to a pay channel, which we would do in collaboration with both our content partners and affiliates.”That might seem like a counter-intuitive move if you are still under the naïve belief television revenue is all about eyeballs. But that is simply not the case anymore. Television networks and those who own them (like News Corp.) make a fortune from cable television. That is the golden goose these days, not ratings.Let me explain:Right now, you and I pay outrageously expensive monthly cable bills because we are forced to pay for dozens of channels we never watch. Even if you never watch MSNBC, you are still subsidizing Rachel Maddow and every other channel in your cable package, because most every network in your cable package receives a monthly fee for every customer forced into a cable package that includes them.How do you think all these lousy networks manage to stay alive? Trust me, MSNBC is not making a whole lot of money from advertisers with fewer than a million viewers. What keeps junk like Oprah and MSNBC afloat is the monthly fee we involuntarily pay when we are forced to purchase packages that include 200 channels, even though all we really want is Fox News and Turner Classic Movies.And what keeps many of us from running away screaming from the bundled cable racket is that there is a lot of programming we cannot yet get on the internet: Sports and the latest episodes ofModern FamilyandNCIS, for example.Aereo changes much of this. Basically, Aereo removes a major obstacle for anyone desperate to get out from under their cable bill but still hanging on because ofAmerican Idoland the Super Bowl.For $10 a month you get every local channel available over the air (including the networks) along with DVR capability. Add another $7 and you can stream Netflix.What more do you need?Though only available in New York City currently, Aereo has thus far won every major court battle against those desperate to hang on to their cable fees and now, according to theWashington Post, plans to expand into Washington, D.C. and 21 other markets this summer.Even without Aereo, there are five million fewer cable subscribers today than there were in 2007. The population might be increasing, but young people are getting used to watching content online.Thanks to the wonders of technology, capitalism, and market choices that brought us streaming, the era of the evil known as bundled cable is coming to an end.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC"

A state-run newspaper in the northeastern province of Jilin last year published a list of tips on how civilians can protect themselves in the event of a nuclear attack."

But it shows that an unidentified contractor figured out how to get snacks without paying.The machines took stored value payment cards from the FreedomPay company.The contractor figured out that if you disconnect the cable that connects the machines with FreedomPay’s cloud-based payment systems, they would accept a card that has no more funds.The culprit told friends who also disconnected the machines’ cords to download snacks for free.But, of course, the agency finally caught up. After suspicions were raised, CIA officials put surveillance cameras on the machines, and figured out the scam.The main perpetrator “admitted to originating the idea of how to effect the thefts based on his knowledge of computer networks,” according to the report.Members of the cabal were rounded up, interrogated and then escorted from the building and fired by their employers."
3745202790,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/05/07/two-approaches-to-reducing-poverty-only-one-works/,Two Approaches to Reducing Poverty—Only One Works,"White non-Hispanics will be a minority in the U.S. in 30 years, demographers say. There are four states, California, Texas, New Mexico and Hawaii, where tomorrow is a reality today. Statistics indicate that demographics are predictive of poverty levels. So, which states have less poverty?There are two ways the federal government gauges poverty, the 50-year-old Official Poverty Measure and the new Supplemental Poverty Measure. The old poverty yardstick neither accounts for the cost of living from state-to-state, nor does it consider all government benefits, such as food stamps and housing vouchers. The U.S. Census Bureau’s new poverty measure is more comprehensive, even including work-related expenses and taxes.The official poverty rate from 2011 to 2013 was 21.5 percent in New Mexico; 17.2 percent in Texas; 16.0 percent California; and 12.4 percent in Hawaii.But things cost more in California and Hawaii—far more, much of which can be laid at the doorstep of liberal public policies such as restrictive zoning laws that drive up the cost of housing, burdensome regulations, and high taxes.The Supplemental Poverty Measure counts these costs and tells a different story showing 23.4 percent of Californians in poverty—the nation’s highest rate—followed by 18.4 percent in Hawaii; 16 percent in New Mexico; and 15.9 percent in Texas, the same as the national average.According to the Tax Foundation California’s state and local taxes were 52 percent higher than Texas’ as a share of state income in 2011; Hawaii’s taxes were 28 percent higher; New Mexico’s were 15 percent higher.Proportionately, California had 47 percent more people in poverty per capita than Texas; Hawaii, 16 percent; and New Mexico, just under 1 percent more.There are two competing poverty reduction concepts.The longstanding liberal approach is to levy high, progressive taxes to redistribute wealth from the haves to the have-nots; implement large government programs to assist the poor; and meddle with housing markets, using government rules to force the construction of low income housing. This is the California model. Government statistics, which measure results, not intentions, indicate this method doesn’t work well.The Texas model emphasizes work over welfare. Lower taxes, a lighter regulatory burden, and less restrictive zoning laws that allow builders to more adroitly meet housing market demands combine to generate jobs while keeping shelter more affordable for both the middle class and the working poor.Several bills pending before the Legislature would strengthen the Texas model, making the American dream more accessible for all.Leading the pack are the tax cut bills in both the House and the Senate. If enacted, permanent, broad-based tax reductions would stimulate the economy and boost employment, lifting more Texans out of poverty through the dignity of work.A good education is one sure path to prosperity. Proposals to allow school choice in Texas or to authorize teachers to start their own charter schools would open the gates of opportunity for a wider array of Texans.But government rules can discourage gainful employment.Texas’ occupational licensing laws frequently serve more to protect existing businesses than public health and welfare. A statute that requires 1,500 hours of training to practice African hair braiding or touch up hair before a wedding photograph is one extreme example—1,500 hours, by the way, is the amount of training time needed to fly a commercial airliner! Bills are pending to relax these barriers to work and others like them.Similarly, some Texans who committed one low-level offense, done their time, and stayed out of trouble, can still find it difficult to get work and provide for their families. There are bills in both houses that would expand nondisclosure for certain ex-offenders to increase their employment prospects by allowing those who have made a single mistake to have the record of the incident sealed, while still preserving access for law enforcement, prosecutors, schools, banks, and the like.Strengthening the Texas model will further reduce poverty.The Hon. Chuck DeVore is Vice President of Policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation."

Elenis,Gorsuch challenged Olson’s assertion that there have been no cases in the past several years in which the state failed to protect religious liberty.Gorsuch cited the caseMasterpiece CakeShop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission,in whichthe Supreme Court notably reached a 7-2 decision in 2018 that the commission acted with hostility toward religion when it ordered Phillips to make cakes for same-sex weddings and conduct so-called sensitivity training for his employees. In his exchange with Olson, Gorsuch characterized those trainings as a “reeducation program.”The exchange went:Gorsuch:Mr. Phillips did go through a reeducation training program pursuant to Colorado law, did he not Mr. Olson?Olson:He went through a process that ensured he was familiar with —Gorsuch:It was a reeducation program, right?Olson:It was not a reeducation program.Gorsuch:What do you call it?Olson:It was a process to make sure he was familiar with Colorado law.Gorsuch:Someone might be excused for calling that a reeducation program.Gorsuch’s use of the term “reeducation program” is significant, given the authoritarian left’spenchant for such programsin the United States surroundingmarxist racialandgender ideologies, as well as in China, where “reeducation” is applied tothose seen as disloyalto the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and otherpurportedly undesirable minority groups.The exchange took place during oral arguments in a case about a Christian website designer who alleges that Colorado law would force her to design wedding websites for same-sex couples in spite of her convictions.The case involves artist Lorie Smith, owner of graphic design firm 303 Creative LLC, and Director of the Colorado Civil Rights Division Aubrey Elenis (and several other division officials). Smith wants to expand her business to include designing wedding websites, “promoting her understanding of marriage.” She also wants to post a statement on her website “explaining that she can only speak messages consistent with her faith,”accordingto the cert petition. Attorneys argue that the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA) would require her to “create custom websites celebrating same-sex marriage” and would prohibit her statement of faith.The Supreme Court agreed to take up Smith’s case just four years after they ruled in favor of Phillips. However, in Phillips case, the justices did not rule on the central question in his case: whether being made to bake a cake for a same-sex couple violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. In Smith’s case, the Justices have ultimately agreed to answer “whether applying a public accommodation law to compel an artist to speak or stay silent violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.”The case is303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, No. 21-476 in the Supreme Court of the United States."

Movements in the Monday session were influenced heavily by tensions overseas when both a suspected terror attack rocked Germany and the Russian envoy to Turkey was assassinated in the span of a few hours.Platts reported that crude oil may be flowing out of the U.S. market through the Gulf Coast as refiners there look to shed inventory for year-end tax purposes.The price for Brent was up 1.5 percent to start the trading day at $55.72 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark price for oil, was up 1 percent to open in New York at $53.56 per barrel.Industry data from the American Petroleum Institute on inventories is released Tuesday after the U.S. market closes. Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are released about an hour after trading opens Wednesday.Crude oil prices waxed and waned last week on dueling sentiments of balance. A report last week from the International Energy Agency said demand for oil could surpass the level of supplies available on the market at some point during the first half of the year provided members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers honor a production cap starting in January. According to OPEC, it will be the second half, not the first half of next year, that balance returns.Russia, which would be a major contributor to a production cap from the non-OPEC side, has been an influential player in the oil market. Oil company Lukoil said this week it had no directions to cut production from some of its larger operations in Iraq, which initially balked at the production deal citing the need to finance counter-terrorism operations.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday signed off on a federal budget that expects a $45.4 billion deficit next year. The budget is pegged on oil priced at around $40 per barrel."

The rapid firing killed 58 people and injured more than 500.“The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,” NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre and Executive Director Chris Cox added in a joint statement.The NRA, the United States’ largest gun-lobbying group, said though that outright banning of guns would not have stopped the “criminal act of a madman.”Earlier Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said lawmakers would look into the legality of bump stocks.“I think we’re quickly coming up to speed with what this is,” Ryan told MSNBC. “Fully automatic weapons have been banned for a long time. Apparently this allows you to take a semiautomatic and turn it into a fully automatic. So clearly that’s something we need to look into.”Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., planned to introduce legislation Thursday or Friday to ban “bump stocks,” a spokeswoman said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced a similar bill in the Senate Wednesday.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders restated the president’s position, that he wanted to wait until the cause of Sunday’s mass shooting has been determined before the administration starts trying to fix the problem.On the bump stock legislation, she said “we certainly would welcome that” and “would like to be part of that conversation.”Ultimately, Sanders added, “the president’s a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. That hasn’t changed.”"

LEEAssociated PressPYONGYANG, North KoreaNorth Korea is loosening some restrictions on foreign cellphones by allowing visitors to bring their own phones into the country. However, security regulations still prohibit mobile phone calls between foreigners and locals.For years, North Korea required visitors to relinquish foreign cellphones at the border until their departure, leaving many tourists without an easy way to communicate with the outside world.The ritual of handing over phones was part of an exhaustive security check that most visitors face at immigration in North Korea. Many foreigners _ including Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, who traveled to North Korea earlier this month _ choose to leave their phones behind in Beijing before flying to Pyongyang.Now, foreigners can bring wideband, WCDMA-compatible mobile phones into the country or rent a local handset at the airport, and purchase a local SIM card for use in North Korea. The SIM card allows them to call most foreign countries, foreign embassies in Pyongyang and international hotels in the North Korean capital, according to Ryom Kum Dan of 3G cellphone service provider Koryolink.Cellphones rent for about $3.50 per day and SIM cards cost about $67, she said Monday. Satellite phones are prohibited, she said.However, foreigners will not be able to communicate by mobile phone with local North Koreans, whose cellphones operate on a separate network, and they will not have access to the Internet using locally provided SIM cards. They can phone Japan and the United States, but not South Korea.Cellphone use has multiplied in North Korea since Egyptian telecommunications firm Orascom built a 3G network in North Korea four years ago. More than a million people are using cellphones in the country, according to Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, which runs Koryolink as part of a joint venture with North Korea’s telecommunications ministry called CHEO Technology JV Co.The 3G network also provides North Koreans with access to the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper for a fee, but not to the global Internet.On Friday, Koryolink saleswomen were setting up cellphone rental booths at Pyongyang’s Sunan airport. One poster depicting a woman in a traditional Korean dress with a cellphone pressed to her ear read, “Here You Can Buy Koryolink Visitor Line.”During his recent four-day trip to North Korea, Schmidt urged North Korea to provide its people with better access to the global Internet. The Google executive chairman noted that it would be “very easy” for North Korea to offer Internet on the 3G cellphone network.“As the world becomes increasingly connected, the North Korean decision to be virtually isolated is very much going to affect their physical world and their economic growth. It will make it harder for them to catch up economically,” he wrote in a Google blog entry posted Sunday.“It is their choice now, and in my view, it’s time for them to start, or they will remain behind.”___Kim Kwang Hyon contributed to this report.

Wasfi Alshdaifat and Eng. Farah Qassab, decided that the development by international companies for flexible, manually foldable tablets also need a further developed automatic folding and unfolding mechanism.The main inventor, Wasfi Alshdaifat, said, “The international search and examining authorities have written in their reports that the 55 claims in the four inventions are totally industrially applicable, novel, and inventive, compared to the searched patents, which were referring to Samsung, LG, Toshiba and other companies.From her side, Eida Muhairbi stated that according to the PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty), the major competent companies capable of developing their prototypes into marketable products, based on the positive results of the high-quality international search reports from WIPO, had requested them to enter into the international phase, to get their patents granted from the relevant patents offices in USA, China, Japan, Europe, and South Korea. Almuhairbi added, “Now, it will be easy to get the patents granted from these offices, but we need to file 20 national patent applications in these offices, which costs around AED 2,000,000 as fees for the agent offices’ service charges and patents filing fees.WIPO has published 15 international patent applications for the UAE so far this year, including 6 (40%) for the Almuhairbi and Alshdaifat team, who now have thirty registered international patents applications with the WIPO making them the top inventive body in the country, ahead of UAE university which has eight.WAM/TF/CM"

WALKERAP Sports WriterNASHVILLE, Tenn.Tennessee Titans president and CEO Tommy Smith had not made any decisions Friday night after reviewing every part of the team with coach Mike Munchak and his general manager.Smith said in a statement that he planned all along to review every aspect of the team’s football operations when the season ended and did just that in his meeting with Munchak and Ruston Webster.“We had good discussions, but no final decisions were made,” Smith said.Munchak and Webster flew to Texas on Friday morning and met all day with Smith before returning late in the afternoon. Munchak’s truck was moved onto the tarmac at the Nashville airport, and he eluded reporters by driving out a different gate.The Tennessean cited sources Friday that Smith had decided to keep Munchak as his coach for 2014.Munchak, who has a season left on his contract, is 22-26 since being hired Feb. 7, 2011. His only winning season came in 2011 at 9-7 slumping to 6-10 in 2011. Owner Bud Adams spent more than $100 million in the offseason on 13 new free agents, but the Titans went 7-9 for 2013 with quarterback Jake Locker missing 14 of 32 starts to injuries.But Munchak has said the Titans are close to being a playoff team needing only a few more players.Webster said in a statement that they had a good conversation about moving the Titans forward.“Nothing final has been decided at this point, but we hope to have a decision soon,” Webster said.Munchak said Monday he loves this job and the challenge of bringing the Titans together to win a championship. The Titans have missed the postseason five straight years and haven’t won a playoff game since January 2003.___AP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org"
1149632161,http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Sports/2013/03/19/Mississippis-colorful-Henderson-hits-big-stage,Mississippi's Colorful Henderson Hits Big Stage,"(AP) Mississippi’s colorful Henderson hits big stageBy DAVID BRANDTAP Sports WriterOXFORD, Miss.The Marshall Henderson road show has at least one more stop.Mississippi’s polarizing and high-scoring guard averaged more than 23 points per game in the Rebels’ run to a Southeastern Conference title. Along the way, he dumped 27 points on Missouri, flummoxed Vanderbilt’s defense and mocked Florida’s crowd by doing the school’s gator chomp after making a big 3-pointer in the championship game.Ole Miss coach Andy Kennedy isn’t always crazy about Henderson’s antics. But he usually can’t argue with the results.Love him or hate him, Henderson can alter games in his hurry.Now he’ll try to help 12th-seeded Ole Miss (26-8) pull off a few upsets in its first trip to the Big Dance in more than a decade. First up is a game against No. 5 seed Wisconsin (23-11) on Friday in Kansas City, Mo.Opponents and their fans may loathe Henderson, but his Ole Miss teammates don’t have anything bad to say. Fifth-year senior Murphy Holloway said Henderson’s moxie is one of the main reasons the Rebels have finally progressed from the NIT to the NCAA tournament.All of the attention on Henderson has also revealed his checkered past, which includes multiple run-ins with police and a jail stint in Texas last year after a probation violation. Kennedy knew about Henderson’s past issues before he signed, and says there have been no problems at Ole Miss.Now the 6-foot-2 guard–who started his career at Utah and then played at a junior college in Texas before transferring to Ole Miss–has turned the Rebels into one of the most offensive-minded teams in the country.Henderson averages 20.1 points per game, leading an Ole Miss team that is among the nation’s leaders with nearly 78 points per game.Though his reputation as a long-range gunner is largely earned–367 of his 507 shot attempts have come from behind the 3-point line–his game has proven to be more diversified as the season’s progressed. He ranks second on the team with 59 assists and 47 steals.Henderson said one reason he came to Ole Miss is because of Kennedy. The 45-year-old played in college at North Carolina State and Alabama-Birmingham in the 1980s, had many of the same skills and even a little bit of added personality.Kennedy agrees with the comparison–to a point.Now Kennedy will try to prepare Henderson and the rest of the Rebels for a Wisconsin defense that knows few peers. The Badgers are also battle-tested after navigating a brutal Big Ten schedule and making it to the Big Ten tournament championship before losing to Ohio State.And if the Rebels are going to have a chance to knock off one of the Big Ten’s best teams, Henderson will almost certainly have to play well. He’s scored at least 20 points in five straight games.___Follow David Brandt on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP"

7637820089,https://www.breitbart.com/news/time-ticking-for-pochettinos-tottenham-to-prove-they-are-winners/,Time ticking for Pochettino’s Tottenham to prove they are winners,"London (AFP) – Tottenham’s improbable rollercoaster run to the club’s first ever Champions League final last season has masked a steady decline in results for Mauricio Pochettino’s men stretching back to February.The tension, emotion and elation of the late drama that saw Spurs past Manchester City in the quarter-finals and Ajax in the last four will live long in the memory.But having ultimately fallen shot in the final against Liverpool, Pochettino remains without a trophy after five seasons in charge.That does not diminish the impact the Argentine has had in transforming Tottenham from Europa League regulars to Champions League contenders.Yet, it may well be that the window for this Spurs squad to win the Champions League closed with defeat to Liverpool on June 1.Last season’s remarkable Champions League campaign began in the group stages when Pochettino’s men seemed down and out after picking up just one point from their opening three games against Inter Milan, Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven.A far kinder draw this time around sees Spurs travel to Olympiakos on Wednesday with Bayern Munich and Red Star Belgrade to come in Group B.Tottenham should be confident of progress to the last 16 for a third straight season, but their form over the past seven months means they can take little for granted.Prior to undoubtably their best performance of the season so far, a 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday, Spurs had mustered just 16 points from their last 16 Premier League games.Pochettino  has pointed to a myriad of reasons for that slump.The amazing Champions League nights in Manchester and Amsterdam drew the very last sources of energy from a stretched squad that wore down during a 57-game season and were missing talisman Harry Kane for much of the second half of the campaign.Spurs were also in the midst of moving from Wembley to a sparkling new 62,000 capacity stadium and had not signed a player in 18 months.Most of those problems have now been addressed. Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani lo Celso and Ryan Sessegnon have bolstered the squad, although all three have suffered injury problems early in their Spurs careers. Kane is back fit. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is beginning to feel like home.However, Pochettino was still unhappy as the futures of Christan Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen cast a cloud over their start to the season.“I think it showed that the team was unsettled. When the team is unsettled, when the squad is unsettled, it is so difficult to perform in the way you want to perform,” said Pochettino on Saturday.“I’m not complaining or blaming anyone, but in football it’s so easy to describe situations and the focus wasn’t on playing football and it wasn’t on trying to improve. The focus wasn’t on the places we wanted it and it’s not easy to perform that way.”All three are into the  final year of their contract suggesting a break up of the squad Pochettino has assembled is coming sooner rather than later, but a dismantling of Palace in the first 45 minutes on Saturday provides hope they have one more chance of realistically competing for trophies ahead.“If we show that intensity in all our games for sure we are going to fight for big things,” added Pochettino.“I am so happy to recover that feeling. We all needed it but now it’s to keep pushing. This is the first step of the season.”"

Maxine Waters (D-CA) on Monday went on a social media tirade against President Donald Trump over his administration’s response to the spread of the Chinese coronavirus in the United States, describing him as an “incompetent idiot” and demanded that he pray for forgiveness.“Trump, stop congratulating yourself! You’re a failure & you’ve mishandled this#COVID19disaster! You’re not knowledgeable & you don’t know more than experts & generals,” Waters, who serves as chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, wrote on Twitter. “Your ignorance & incompetence are appalling & you continue to demonstrate that every time you open your mouth!”“Trump, you incompetent idiot! You sent 18 tons of PPE to China early but ignored warnings & called COVID19 concerns a hoax. You’ve endangered doctors, nurses, aids, [sic] orderlies, & janitors – all risking their lives to save ours. Pray 4 forgiveness for the harm that you’re causing!” she added.Waters’ comments come after she accused President Trump on Sunday of ignoring early warnings of the pandemic.“As you know, we had an office of pandemic affairs basically in the office of the president that was shut down, closed down, not funded by the president of the United States,” the California DemocrattoldMSNBC host Joy Reid. “That’s the kind of office that does the planning, that anticipates, that makes sure that supplies and everything that’s needed can be readily available when you have this kind of disaster. And so even though we didn’t have that kind of planning in addition to that, the early notifications I’m told were ignored.”Despite Waters’ accusations, the Trump administration has made significant progress in boosting testing nationwide and launched a public-private partnership called“Project Airbridge”in an effort expedite the delivery of medical supplies to the U.S. On Sunday, the first flight landed in New York carrying 130,000 N95 masks, 1.8 million face masks and gowns, and over 10.3 million gloves.Additionally, Fordannouncedon Monday that it will partner with GE to build 50,000 ventilators 100 days. White House Defense Production Act Coordinator Peter Navarro lauded the announcement. “Just as Ford in the last century moved its manufacturing might seamlessly from auto to tank production during World War II, the Ford team is working with GE Healthcare to use its awesome engineering and manufacturing capabilities to voluntarily help this nation solve one of its most pressing problems. We salute that effort and look forward to the first ventilators rolling off the Michigan assembly line in record time – and we’ll be there to salute that milestone,” Navarro said in a statement.As of Tuesday morning, the U.S. has 164, 719 coronavirus cases and 3,170 deaths, according to data via John Hopkins University."

(AP) — People have scoured evacuation centers, called 911 and posted desperate online pleas for help finding relatives they haven’t heard from since a fast-moving wildfire devastated a Northern California town.A day after tens of thousands evacuated the town of Paradise and the nearby community of Magalia, dozens of people, many of them elderly, remained unaccounted for. Anguished relatives flooded social media asking for help locating their loved ones.Cherri Rolla’s family hasn’t heard from her 83-year-old aunt, Sylvia Johnson, who lives in Paradise with at least six dogs and three horses. Rolla says a grandson living nearby saw Johnson on Thursday and tried to get her to leave, but she refused.“When he went back, they wouldn’t let him in,” said Rolla, who lives of North Dakota. “The hardest part is to be so far away and not figure out what we’re going to try to do to find her.”On Friday, they got a call that a woman at a church in Oroville may be Johnson.“We don’t have 100 percent confirmation that it’s her,” Rolla said. “I’m trying not to get too terribly excited.”Social media sites were filled with gut-wrenching pleas for help, including one from the relatives of Jean Forsman.Diane Forsman, who lives in New Hampshire, said her 83-year-old mother can’t walk on her own and relies on oxygen. Her caretaker wasn’t able to reach her Thursday morning when the fire swept through Magalia.“It’s terrifying,” Diane Forsman said by telephone. “We’re trying to remain hopeful until we get word. We don’t know what the outcome will be.”She and her brother posted on social media to see if anyone had seen her. They tried calling 911 and other numbers. They were told officials had a list of 300 to 400 welfare checks to do.Finally, they got word through Facebook on Friday morning that someone in her neighborhood had picked up a woman with disabilities. But the Forsmans haven’t been able to confirm yet whether it’s their mom.Many of the missing are seniors without cellphones or social media accounts who had moved to the Northern California area that’s known as a refuge for retirees.“Paradise, unfortunately, is just one of those (places) — there’s a lot of elderly, a lot of immobile people, some low income with no vehicles,” Chico police Officer John Barker said.The missing included Richard Wayne Johnson and his wife, Suzanne Johnson, who live in an RV park in Paradise that is believed to have burned, said his daughter Dawn Johnson of Independence, Oregon.“He has Stage 4 prostate cancer, she’s in her 70s and mostly confined to her bed due to fibromyalgia,” Dawn Johnson said.The couple moved from Texas to the California foothill town about a year ago and were probably not prepared to evacuate in a wildfire, she said.Johnson hasn’t been able to reach them by cellphone, and fellow members of the couple’s Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation in Paradise told her they have not seem them at shelters.“I checked all over Red Cross, anything you can think of I’ve tried to do,” she said.Families sought help on Twitter from the actor James Woods who began posting and retweeting messages from relatives looking for loved ones using two hashtags he started.Sarah Slate and her family were terrified when it had been more than a day since they heard from her 39-year-old brother, Richard Slate, who has special needs and lives alone.“All you want to do is cry because you don’t have an answer either way,” said Slate, who lives in central California. “Not knowing is driving us crazy. You’re hoping for the best but in this situation, you’re left wondering: ‘Is he alive?’By Friday afternoon, Slate said someone had found him, though she didn’t know all the details. “Praise Jesus,” she said in a text message.Jessica Van Amber, 18, who lives in Magalia but was 15 miles (24 kilometers) away in Chico when the fire broke out, searched several shelters, called friends and appealed to people on social media to help her find her aunt and mom.About 24 hours after she heard they were rushing to flee Magalia, Van Amber posted on Twitter: “UPDATE: MY MOM HAS BEEN FOUND!!!!!!”Van Amber said by telephone that she was so relieved they were safe, but “it doesn’t look like there’s anything left of our home.”___Le reported from Seattle.

He is in a good moment and his development so far has been really good, he has adapted well,” Klopp said.“He is a really good player but it is how it is with specialist left full-backs, it is difficult; you play or it is possible you are not in the squad.“He is on a really good way and everything is fine from my side. It is very early, he came in late and he has to adapt to our style of play.“The rule is if you train really good, if you work really hard, if you improve, if you develop, everything will be good at the end.”Klopp said he is eagerly anticipating Liverpool’s first match of the season at Anfield, even though it’s against a Palace team who have often proved tricky opponents for the Reds.“I’m really looking forward to Anfield,” Klopp added.“It was a long time ago that we played there and that’s our place, that’s where we want to play, that’s where we want to be, especially after these two first games. We already showed we are ready again.”Liverpool have been boosted by the availability of England striker Daniel Sturridge after he recovered from a thigh injury picked up in pre-season.– Transitional stage –However, Klopp is still without Brazil forward Coutinho, ruled out with a back problem, at the end of a week that saw Liverpool reiterate their desire to hold onto their wantaway star amid continued interest from Barcelona.“Phil is not available; he is not training so far, so there is nothing new. It is always how it is with injured players, there is no real time on when he is back,” Klopp said.Frank De Boer’s career as Crystal Palace manager could hardly have got off to a worse start with the Dutchman’s side slumping to a 3-0 home defeat to promoted Huddersfield Town.The scoreline was bad enough, but worse was to come for De Boer when he learned that winger Wilfried Zaha will be out for a month with a knee injury sustained in that opening day clash.Defender Joel Ward insists there is no lack of confidence among the Palace squad as they attempt to stage a repeat of April’s victory at Liverpool that helped keep them up.“It’s a transitional stage for us. It’s great, it’s going to be exciting,” he said.“Obviously the weekend was disappointing, but we’ll dust ourselves down and we’ve got 37 games to make up for it.“I think we can go there with confidence and the belief that we can do what we’ve done before and take it to them again.”"

Being able to carry out the re-programming in vivo makes it possible to imagine a future in which we form new cells directly in the human brain, without taking a detour via cell cultures and transplants,"" Parmar said."

It was supposed to highlight Dodge volunteer program Ram Nation.But it was criticized by viewers and ad experts alike for forging too tenuous a connection with the civil rights hero.On Twitter, most people expressed the idea that using King’s speech to “sell trucks” crossed a line between a heartfelt message and exploiting emotions just to push a vehicle.“They pushed it over the edge,” said Kelly O’Keefe, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Brandcenter. “You wanted to root for it because the cause is good, but it just didn’t end up fitting the brand, so you ended up feeling a little bit manipulated.”“The use of MLK to promote Ram trucks strikes many people as crass and inappropriate,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University.Watching at home, some viewers expressed distaste for the ad as well.“I liked being reminded of Martin Luther King’s speech (but) I’m not sure it was fitting for a truck commercial,” said Kimberly Stites, who was watching the game in Gretna, Nebraska. “I would have liked it better if they had said something like, ‘This reminder of all that we can be brought to you by ….'”Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that it worked closely with the King estate on the ad.The firm managing King’s intellectual property, Intellectual Properties Management, said in a statement that it approved the ad because it embodied King’s philosophy.The ad is not the first one to use a King Speech.

Trump had wholly pulled out of the multi-country nuclear deal last year, saying it was “defective at its core.”On Tuesday, U.S. think tank on Middle East policy The Washington Institute said there have been eight “Iranian proxy attacks” against U.S. personnel including military and diplomats under the Trump administration.The most recent aggression occurred May 19 when Iraqi Shia militia members allegedly fired a rocket toward the Baghdad’s International Zone, landing half a mile away from the U.S. embassy.As a close ally to both the United States and Iran, Iraq should play the role as mediator, especially since no other country would be greater affected by conflict between the two countries, Abdul Mahdi said.“This is our national duty,” Abdul Mahdi said. “This is our responsibility in defending, in protecting, Iraq and its people.”The announcement came two weeks after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unannounced trip to Iraq to meet with leaders in response to Iran “escalating their activity,” he said.Abdul Mahdi said there are those who want to inflame the situation, but Iraq is not one of them.“On our side, we haven’t seen an Iraqi party in the political process that wants to push things towards a crisis or extremity, except for individual behavior,” he said. “We didn’t find any Iraqi party inside the political process that wants to push things to the directions of war.”"

Forty percent of Americans can’t afford a $400 bill, whether it’s medical or fixing their car. Fifteen percent of Americans make minimum wages, 70,000 die from opioids” annually, he said.“Companies have to be involved,” Dimon said. “Businesses can bypass all these parts of society that have been suffering a little bit because they do it themselves. They have their own schools, their own training, their own everything.”Of the $350 million set aside for the initiative, $125 million will go toward strengthening education and training systems, directly linking employers and educators to ensure students are learning the job skills needed to succeed. Some $200 million will go toward developing new training and education programs, and $25 million will go toward distributing labor market data to assist investment decisions.Jamie Dimon says the U.S. economy has left the poor behind from CNBC."
5458575641,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/12/obama-cuban-shutdown-scrambles-immigration-politics/,Obama’s Support for Cuban Dictatorship Scrambles Immigration Politics,"President Barack Obama’s decision to shut down the 51-year-old pathway for Cuban immigration into the United States is being praised by his usual enemies, and slammed by his usual friends.“It is long overdue,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, who support the Cuban shutdown. His group wants to reduce the worldwide annual inflow of 2 million legal migrants and contract workers into the United States, who compete for jobs against the four million Americans who turn 18 each year.“We should never deny a Cuban refugee fleeing a brutal regime entry into the United States,” said a statement from Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who worked with Obama in 2013 to pass a law that would have sharply increased legal immigration of foreign workers into the United States.“Obama’s just scrapped the “wet foot, dry foot” policy,” lamented a tweet from an pro-migration advocate at the Cato Institute. “Terrible move,” added advocate, Alex Nowrasteh, who frequently urges increased migration into the United States, and has backed Obama’s effort to expand immigration.David Bier, another pro-immigration advocate at Cato also lamented the shut-off.Matthew Kolken, an immigration lawyer in Buffalo, N.Y., suggested Obama’s shutdown was done for electoral advantage.The reason for this apparent flip-flop among immigration advocates, however, is that Obama’s immigration policy change is being driven by foreign policy, not by immigration policy.Since 2014, he has tried to reduce American and international diplomatic and economic sanctions on Cuba’s national-socialist dictatorship.The decision “grows out of the normalization of relations between our countries,” Obama’s foreign policy spokesman, Ben Rhodes, told reporters Thursday afternoon. The shutdown decision was secretly prepared because “we did not want to speculate publicly about the likelihood of this change for fear of inviting even greater migration flows,” he said.That move to reduce immigration is a big shift for Obama, who has repeatedlysaid that Americans don’t have the right to limit foreign migration into the United States. In November, 2014, for example,he declaredthat:Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, ‘Well, I don’t want those folks’ — even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans.Obama’s decision to shut down the path for migrating Cubans “is the obvious corollary of Obama’s normalizing relations with Cuba,” said Krikorian. “This should have been part of the original [2014 U.S-Cuban] deal … but better late than never,” he added.Krikorian supports the shutdown, partly because Cuban migration has increased the supply of low-wage labor, and so reduced Americans’ wages. The greatest impact was seen in 1980, when a massive movement of Cubans into Miami sharplyreduced wages for unskilled Americans, including African-AmericansMenendez — who worked with Obama to pass the 2013 “Comprehensive Immigration Reform” bill that would given work-permits to roughly 33 million foreigners in 10 years — also blamed Obama’s foreign policy for the Cuban migration shutdown.“The Obama administration seeks to pursue engagement with the Castro regime at the cost of ignoring the present state of torture and oppression, and its systematic curtailment of freedom,” said Menendez.Some left-wing groups agree with Obama’s decision to favor the Cuban dictatorship over Cuban migrants.Geoffrey Thale, at the left-wing Washington Office on Latin America, also endorsed the shutdown while alsosupporting greater immigrationfrom Cuba.“The Obama Administration has taken a positive step toward a more sensible Cuban immigration policy, one that ends preferential treatment for Cubans compared with others who arrive without visas,” said his statement.Cubans have been seeking entry into the United States primarily because of economic stagnation at home. The U.S. embargo is one of many factors that has contributed to that stagnation, and so WOLA and many colleagues have recommended to the Administration that it should both end preferential treatment for Cubans and increase the number of visas available to Cubans who pursue regular immigration routes.”Similarly, an author at the American Immigration Council recently promoted a pending bill that would shut down the path. “As our country moves closer to normalizing relations with Cuba, the calls to re-examine our Cuba policy will only continue to grow. Instead of waiting until the last minute to act, Congress should begin looking at this issue now,”the article said.During Obama’s terms in office, he has allowed a growing inflow of migrants from Central Americans and Cuba.Since 2012, for example, he allowed more than 350,000 migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to apply for asylum.Since 2012, more than 100,000 Cubans have also claimed asylum under the 1966 anti0communist law that first set up the Cuban pathway.According toPew Research Center, “Overall, 43,159 Cubans entered the U.S. via ports of entry in fiscal year 2015, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data obtained through a public records request. This represents a 78% increase over the previous year, when 24,278 Cubans entered. And those 2013 numbers had already increased dramatically after the Cuban government lifted travel restrictions. By comparison, in fiscal 2011, just 7,759 Cubans came into the U.S.”"

And that could be a “big problem” for his wife Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, Scarborough said.According to Scarborough, previous allegations of Bill Clinton’s indiscretions, particularly in the 2008 presidential cycle when Hillary Clinton ran against Barack Obama, were not discussed in public forums. However, this time will be different because of Trump’s ability to promote a story line and force the media to talk about it.“By the way, we’ll do what other news shows don’t do,” Scarborough said. “What we do all the time and we’ll actually say what people say off the air and not saying off the air and not attribute anything to the — I am talking about over the past — since 2008. Leading into 2008, everybody that came on the air talked about the same three women that Bill Clinton was having an affair with in 2008 and said, ‘It’s going to destroy his campaign.’ And, ‘It’s going to this and it’s going to that and it’s going to come out and everybody can repeat, give the three women’s names, where they’re from, their positions. That’s the thing that’s kind of remained quiet. The same thing with John Edwards and the affair he was having.”“You’re right,” he continued. “Everybody was too gentile. There are some people that were smooching Hillary Clinton left-and-right right now that were running around the Washington bureau saying this is going to blow up. It’s kill her campaign. Nobody ever talked about it because everybody played by the rules. The same thing has happened in the lead up to this campaign. Everybody’s talking about, I don’t know this Jeffrey Epstein guy. Is that his right name? People in the know always talk about Jeffrey Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein. I don’t even know who that dude is but I know that people in the know that are in this media area that don’t do what I do which is go to work and go home and hang out with their kids, they talk about Jeffrey Epstein.”“There’s going to be a big problem because of Bill Clinton and there’s always a swirl and it’s not by right wingers, it’s by the most powerful people in media and they’re always going like these would be really bad, bad issues for Hillary and Bill if anybody had the guts to bring it up,” Scarborough added. “Nobody does. That’s what makes Donald Trump more dangerous than any person out there. He will bring up stuff that nobody else will bring up and anybody thinking in the Clinton campaign that they’re going to get a break because it’s Donald Trump doing this instead of Jeb Bush, you are in lala land because there are no rules when it comes to Donald Trump for any of us, for any of us, anybody, anywhere.”Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter@jeff_poor"

Draghi said in September the bank could push interest rates further into the negative and continue “quantitative easing” to help the economy.The ECB’s decision kept the ECB’s benchmark borrowing rate at zero, while leaving banks with interest rates of -0.5 percent. The bank agreed to restart its stimulus program on Nov. 1, saying it will buy more than 20 billion euros worth of bonds each month until growth and inflation normalize.Draghi’s eight years as head of the ECB were marked with successes and failures, announcing a rate cut of 25 basis points in his first two months and famously vowing in July 2012 to do “whatever it takes” to save the Euro.“He arrived to the recession and ballooning peripheral spreads,” Kit Juckes, of French investment bank Societe General, said. “He delivered a de facto guarantee to the Eurozone bond markets that dismayed some of his colleagues but which has removed one major structural failing of the single currency system.“He revived growth without reviving inflation much, delivering an average of 1.2 percent real GDP growth and 1.2 percent CPI inflation over the course of his term,” Juckes added.Nick Wall, of Merian Global Investor, said Draghi’s inflation goals, though, were not met during his tenure and Europe still faces challenging demographic trends.“Draghi’s now famous ‘whatever it takes’ moment saved the Eurozone by finally allowing the ECB to become a credible lender of last resort, a key facet for any central bank,” Wall said. “Sovereign spreads have converged ever since, allowing for the odd political wobble, with Draghi’s ECB loaning money to banks, buying up sovereign and corporate debt, and taking interest rates below zero.“His legacy is the survival of the euro during its toughest test to date using methods that were previously anathema to a central bank steeped in the traditions of the Bundesbank,” he added."

Some refer to operations that in some cases involve countries not publicly allied with the United States.The Post said the process of informing officials about the risk of disclosure is delicate because in some cases, one part of the cooperating government may know about the collaboration, but others may not.National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the U.S. takes the concerns of the international community seriously “and has been regularly consulting with affected partners.” She declined to comment on diplomatic discussions."

What is important is the language of the statute and our rights as parents.”This is not the first time the state has rejected a request to name a child after a religious figure.A Tennessee judgerejected a family’s request to name their son “Messiah” in 2014because she believed Messiah could only describe Jesus Christ and placed an “undue burden” on the child that he could not fulfill. That judge was later fired, and the judge’s decision was overturned."

The new program aims to help less privileged students access the Internet and continue learning when they get home from school.The 27 cities the Department of Housing and Urban Development selected for ConnectHome are: Albany, Georgia; Atlanta; Baltimore; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Boston; Camden, New Jersey; Cleveland; Denver; Durham, North Carolina; Fresno, California; Kansas City, Missouri; Little Rock, Arkansas; Los Angeles; Macon, Georgia; Memphis, Tennessee; Meriden, Connecticut; Nashville, Tennessee; New Orleans; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Philadelphia; Rockford, Illinois; San Antonio; Seattle; Springfield, Massachusetts; Tampa, Florida; and the District of Columbia.Obama was spending the night in Oklahoma and continuing a weeklong focus on making the criminal justice system fairer.He planned to meet Thursday with law enforcement officials and inmates during a historic tour of the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution, a medium-security facility west of Oklahoma City that holds about 1,300 male offenders. “I will be the first sitting president to visit a federal prison,” Obama said Tuesday as he addressed the annual NAACP convention in Philadelphia.El Reno once housed Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.___Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap"

5949853703,http://www.breitbart.com/news/sky-steamroller-crushes-froomes-rivals/,Sky ‘steamroller’ crushes Froome’s rivals,"Düsseldorf (Germany) (AFP) – When Chris Froome’s Tour de France rivals roll up to the start line in Dusseldorf on Saturday, they will be worrying not only about how to beat the Briton, but also his Sky team.Sky have won four of the last five Tours and in each the team, as much as the victor (Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and Froome three times since) have proved too strong for the opposition.Never was that more evident than last year when Sky managed to all but kill any suspense and drama by taking a stranglehold of the race from start to finish.Froome only looked vulnerable twice during that race, once after being knocked off his bicycle on Mont Ventoux by a photographer’s motorcycle, and then after crashing on a wet and slippery descent on the 19th stage.However, he hardly lost any time from either incident while he usually had his all-powerful Sky team-mates surrounding him to keep him out of trouble.On that 19th stage when disaster could have struck, Dutchman Wout Poels remained alongside Froome to guide him safely to the finish.On the 11th stage he had Welshman Geraint Thomas to thank for helping him latch onto an attack from Peter Sagan to take advantage of crosswinds and steal some time on his rivals.Once again Sky look to be bringing a formidable force to the race, even if the injured Poels is not amongst them.“Not having Wout here is a big change, he was a big part of my victory last year and certainly we’re going to miss him,” said Froome.Former world champion Michal Kwiatkowski of Poland will be riding as a domestique for Froome while Thomas and Spaniard Mikel Landa, who had led the team at May’s Giro d’Italia, will provide chief support in the mountains.Those two suffered from crashes at the Giro that wrecked their overall hopes and have quickly switched to domestique duties.– ‘Extremely strong’ –Alongside them, Froome will also be able to count on Spanish veteran Mikel Nieve and Colombian talent Sergio Henao to help him negotiate the toughest climbs.“We have an extremely strong team in the mountains, if you look at the other GC teams, I definitely feel confident going into the climbs.”On the flat, former world time-trial champion Vasil Kiryienka of Belarus, Briton Luke Rowe and German Christian Knees will supply the power to keep Froome out of trouble.It is a imposing outfit which the French describe as a “steamroller”.And while Sky’s strength may not make for great racing, it is crucial to helping Froome dominate.“It’s true that Team Sky’s most common tactic is to impose a tempo at the front of the peloton that discourages my rivals from attacking me,” said Froome in the official race guide.“This doesn’t necessarily produce the best spectacle but, from our point of view, it’s the ideal way to keep events under control.”Last year Sky sucked the life out of the race but despite their strength, there are at least enough unknowns in bike racing to keep things interesting.In 2014, for example, Froome’s team could do nothing as he crashed three times in the wet over two days and was forced out of the race with a broken wrist.He was also badly exposed once in 2013 when he lost all his team-mates on a crazy stage, although his rivals failed to capitalise as they raced each other for the minor placings rather than trying to put Froome under pressure.If Froome’s rivals are going to have a chance this time around, they need to first find a way to negate the strength of Sky, and that’s not something that has happened often these last five years,"

6828035011,https://www.breitbart.com/news/us-official-detention-center-like-summer-camp-for-migrants/,US official: Detention center like ‘summer camp’ for migrants,"Washington (AFP) – US lawmakers assailed the Trump administration Tuesday for its controversial border policy, as one immigration enforcement official pushed back against charges of abuse to say that family detention centers are like a “summer camp.”The description was the latest disconnect between officials charged with carrying out a controversial “zero tolerance” policy that has led to the separation of thousands of children from their migrant parents, and outraged lawmakers and members of the public who accuse President Donald Trump of creating a child safety crisis.Republicans and Democrats grilled immigration and border enforcement officials at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over a series of decisions in recent months that led to the separation of more than 2,500 undocumented migrant children from their parents or guardians.And while they warned that many young children in US custody have suffered abuse during their detention, Matthew Albence, an executive associate director at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified that conditions at family residential centers were not as bad as described.“I think the best way to describe them is to be more like a summer camp,” Albence told the panel, as he described “24/7” access to fresh food and water, educational classes, outdoor recreational opportunities and exercise.Authorities have struggled to reunify families who were separated after being arrested for illegally crossing the border from Mexico.The detention of separated children, including infants, in cage-like enclosures set off a global outcry, and Trump last month ordered an end to the separations.Under a court order, the government has reunited some 1,800 migrant children with their parents.But 711 children remain in custody, and Senate Democrat Dianne Feinstein warned they may never be reunited with parents.“It’s not an exaggeration to say that the policies of President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions may essentially orphan hundreds of immigrant children,” she said, blasting the policy as “deeply immoral and haphazard.”The panel’s Republican chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley, also offered harsh words, saying the government “is failing miserably” at providing humane treatment.“Mothers have suffered unimaginable physical, mental and emotional and even sexual abuse while in federal custody,” Grassley said. “Obviously that’s unacceptable.”Lawmakers and activists have also focused on some 400 children who remain in detention because their parents were deported.While Grassley and others worried that deportees may not have made informed choices about leaving their children behind, the administration said the departing parents did exactly that.“A great many of these individuals do not wish to have their child return home with them,” because their goal “in the first place is to get their children to the United States,” Albence said.The hearing follows a federal judge’s order to remove many migrant children from a Texas detention center after a lawsuit accused the facility of placing children on psychotropic drugs that acted as “chemical straight-jackets” to control children rather than treat actual health needs."

The majority of those children are now under the age of 15, which is a very different pattern to previously. The majority are now in combat roles being used on the frontlines, and the majority are forced to join, often abducted. They are being used as uninformed, armed checkpoints, and sometimes as forced labour.He also claimed forces pushed more than “several hundred children” to fight in 2015, and at least 400 died as a result.Salama pointed out that strikes destroyed 47 schools in 2015, pushing the total attacks on education to 4,000 since the civil war broke out five years ago.“We are seeing children killed and maimed in schools and playgrounds by all parties to the conflict,” he continued.In November, Human Rights Watch (HRW)reportedthat Shiite militias in Iraq used child soldiers to fight against the Islamic State. Christophe Wilckereported:Many militias in Iraq train or recruit children. Mytham al-Nuri was under 18 when he joined the PMF’s Badr Brigades – his father Karim is the brigades’ spokesman — and fought on the front lines in 2014. He finished high school this September. The Ali Akbar brigades’ Abbas Fighting Team unit provides military training to 15 to 18 year olds in Basra, according [to] a member of the group who spoke to Human Rights Watch in July. The Peace Brigades, another militia group from Basra affiliated with the Sadrist Trend, trains 15 to 18 year olds, according to one of the trainers, but had not sent them to the front line “yet.”The use of child soldiers by anti-ISIS militias has not made headlines like the “Caliphate Cubs” have because these groups do not advertise their use of children the way ISIS does. They boast about their efforts with videos and pictures on social media. Militants often show off the “Cubs” in specialized training camps for kids. In October, authoritiesuncoveredone camp in Istanbul, Turkey.Hürriyet Daily Newsreportedthat “24 of around 50 suspects of Tajik and Uzbek origin” are children who trained in those basement camps. The officers raided 18 homes in the “Pendik and Başakşehir’s Kayaşehir neighborhood.” The houses contained “battlefield maps as well as documents describing the group’s contacts in both countries.” Other evidence led authorities to believe the group intended to meet ISIS in Syria and Iraq.UNICEF also announced an appeal to raise $2.8 billion for children in conflict areas. The organization discovered that one in nine children reside in these zones.At least 25 percent of the funds will be used for education.“Millions of children are being robbed of their education,”declaredAfshan Khan, UNICEF’s director of Emergency Programs.She added:Education is a life-saving measure for children, providing them with the opportunity to learn and play, amidst the carnage of gunfire and grenades. This year, a quarter of our appeal is devoted to education. By educating the minds of children and young people we are building hope so they can envisage a better future for themselves, their families and their societies and help break the cycle of chronic crisis."
1000251115,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA3G8V8O0,NY plaintiff: Gay benefits 'bigger than marriage',"(AP) NY plaintiff: Gay benefits ‘bigger than marriage’By LARRY NEUMEISTERAssociated PressNEW YORKAt age 83, Edith Windsor gets plenty of compliments for her courage to take on the federal government in a landmark case that has put attitudes about gay America squarely before the Supreme Court.But the Philadelphia-born former IBM executive scoffs at how much gumption was necessary to go to court at a time when society seems to be getting more conscious that a closed-minded approach to differences in sexuality appears to do more harm than good.“The world has progressed,” Windsor says. “At the beginning of World War II, they really did think we had horns.”Windsor’s lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan is one of two that the Supreme Court agreed to take up Dec. 7 when it announced it would hear arguments over California’s ban on same-sex unions and Windsor’s dispute about federal benefits for legally married gay couples.“It’s very joyous,” Windsor said in a recent interview at her apartment on Fifth Avenue in lower Manhattan. “I feel like everybody’s treating me like a hero. Everybody thinks it takes enormous courage.”It was a moment she could not fathom when her heart nearly gave out after the 2009 death of her spouse, Thea Clara Spyer, less than two years after their marriage in Canada.Windsor suffered an attack of stress cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome, that was so bad that her heart stopped.“I was ready to go. I didn’t care,” she recalls. “I had a wonderful life.”Now, she’s found new reason to live.“I keep saying, `Keep me alive until after the Supreme Court'” arguments in March, she said. “It’s a very important case. It’s bigger than marriage, and I think marriage is major. I think if we win, the effect will be the beginning of the end of stigma.”The court case was a simple set of facts. Windsor maintained that the federal government’s insistence in the Defense of Marriage Act that a marriage can be only defined as a relationship between a man and a woman meant she was not entitled to a marital deduction on Spyer’s estate.That meant, she said, that she owed $363,053 in taxes that she would not have to pay if the law did not unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.The threat of discrimination was not new. Early in her life, she kept her sexuality from her family and friends, mindful of the dangers. Eventually, revelation of the truth brought sharp criticism from a sister.For a time, she was married to a man she considered her hero after he left the Army just as she was about to enter college. But she told him she was gay, and they eventually divorced.In the early 1950s, she moved to New York City from Philadelphia and obtained a master’s degree in mathematics from New York University in 1957. She then joined IBM and worked for 16 years in senior technical and management positions.In 1963, she met Spyer at a Greenwich Village restaurant known for its friendly attitude toward lesbians. Though they arrived with others, Spyer and Windsor were almost inseparable on the dance floor that night and by evening’s end, Windsor had danced a hole in her stockings.The dancing marathons continued sporadically over the next two years, usually when Spyer and Windsor met by chance at parties and usually to the frustration of their dates.It was not until the spring of 1965 that they got together. Windsor suggested they date for a year and consider engagement for another year if that went well.And, as she said in an affidavit in her court case, Windsor told Spyer: “`And if it still feels this goofy joyous, I’d like us to spend the rest of our lives together.’ And we did.”The engagement stretched for 40 years.Spyer, worried an engagement ring would unintentionally reveal Windsor’s sexual orientation to her IBM colleagues, gave her a circular diamond brooch she wears to this day.“Our choice not to wear traditional engagement rings was just one of many ways in which Thea and I had to mold our lives to make our relationship invisible,” Windsor said in her affidavit.“We both faced pressures not only in the workplace and in society at large, but also from family and friends,” she added. “Like countless other same-sex couples, we engaged in a constant struggle to balance our love for one another and our desire to live openly and with dignity, on the one hand, with our fear of disapproval and discrimination from others on the other.”In 1968, Spyer, a psychologist, and Windsor brought a small house together on New York’s Long Island and traveled frequently.They hosted parties where Spyer displayed her culinary skills and grew ever closer, a tight bond tested repeatedly after Spyer was diagnosed in 1977 at age 45 with multiple sclerosis.Spyer went from using a cane to crutches to a manual wheelchair and eventually to a motorized wheelchair she operated with one functioning hand. When Spyer could no longer swim, Windsor held up her body in the water so she could at least feel the water and splash.Windsor, who had heart trouble, said they went to Toronto to marry when they realized they might not live long enough to wait for New York to approve same-sex marriages.Windsor’s apartment is filled with photographs of the couple, including a life-size picture of a youthful Spyer, and Windsor’s favorite, a picture of them dancing together ago when Spyer was in a wheelchair, swiveling with Windsor in her lap.Windsor marvels at how their lives, once hidden from nearly everyone they knew, are increasingly accepted. She never really expected such changes in her lifetime.“Did I ever think we would be discussing equality in marriage? Never. It was just so far away,” she said.Still, she said, she hopes the Supreme Court rules in a way that can lift the gay community, especially those who are plagued by the effects of prejudice.“I grew up knowing that society thought I was inferior,” she said.Now, Windsor hopes to enjoy a legal victory with a street party in front of a gay center, aware that it would be too large to be held beneath a roof.“There are hundreds and thousands of people who would want to celebrate,” she said."
7010664683,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/06/05/klukowski-trump-should-cancel-senates-august-recess/,Klukowski: Trump Should Cancel Senate’s August Recess,"President Donald Trump should make history by using his constitutional power to recall the Senate (but not the House) in August, canceling the August recess, and force the Senate to stay in session five (or six?) days per week until the Senate confirms a record number of federal judges and fills key positions in his administration to enact his America First agenda.Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that the president has the power to “convene both Houses, or either of them.” President Trump can call the Senate back into session while leaving the house in recess. No president has ever used that power to recall just one chamber—the Senate—for the specific purpose of confirming nominees.Congress goes on recess every August, which in election years is critical campaigning time in their home states, especially in years when (as in 2018) voters are particularly (and rightly) fed up with Washington, DC. Every day back home is a day when a senator or congressman can attend town halls and backyard barbeques, promising the voters that the lawmaker stands with those voters, and railing against the Swamp that many of them actually belong to as card-carrying members.President Trump is not shy about taking unprecedented action (for example, moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem). Forcing senators back to D.C. to confirm his well-qualified nominees would be a historic move that would be an unmitigated victory.Even though the Senate has confirmed a record number of appellate judges at this point, there are even more judicial vacancies today than on January 20, 2017, when President Trump was inaugurated. With the exception of 1991—when Congress created 85 new judgeships—there are more judicial vacancies today than at any point in American history: There are 142 current vacancies with 30 more than are verified to open up in the coming months, for a total of 172 judgeships that need to be filled immediately.President Trump is also rightly frustrated that the Senate has failed to fill key positions in his administration, part of Democrats’ strategy to slow down the president’s America First agenda by depriving him of the political appointees who supervise more than two million federal workers to produce results for the voters.Take the Department of Justice (DOJ) for example. Many of the key divisions have lacked a head since Obama left office. The assistant attorney general positions in the Civil Division, Criminal Division, Civil Rights Division, and others, have been vacant for 17 months, despite the fact that Jody Hunt, Brian Benczkowski, and Eric Dreiband have been waiting since last year for a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.Personnel is policy. When the president orders a new policy direction, it takes political appointees in the relevant agencies to direct their civil-service subordinates to implement that new policy. Without those appointees—both Schedule PAS (Senate-confirmed) appointees in the senior ranks and Schedule C appointees in the junior ranks—the Swamp continues to do whatever it wants, ignoring the commander in chief and the will of the American people.This is a perfect example of how good policy can make good politics. The politics on this situation would be solid gold. President Trump has exactly the right communication style to rally the American people by saying, “I told those lazy bums to get back to D.C. and do their job!”And confirming judicial and executive nominees is a winning issue. In 2016, 21 percent of voters said the Supreme Court was their top issue. Those voters went for Trump over Clinton by a margin of 57 to 41 – a 16-point margin.President Trump can be the no-nonsense CEO that the American people hired, who refuses to be tied down by tradition and conventional wisdom, demanding results for the American people. Trump voters in Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Michigan, Missouri, Florida, and other Trump states with vulnerable Democratic senators would love it. There is nothing those Democratic senators can say in protest that would not dig their hole even deeper.The Constitution grants him the power to fix this. President Trump should let senators know by tweet: “Start working full five-days weeks and get my nominees confirmed, or enjoy spending August on Capitol Hill!”Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Salem, 59, of Westlake, with food stamp fraud, laundering money, operating an unregulated slaughterhouse, and improper possession of firearms for running a $2.7 million food stamp fraud scheme at several gas stations he owned in the Cleveland area between 2010 and 2016, according to astatementfrom the Department of Justice.Investigators say Salem used the illegal terminals inside his gas stations to process fraudulent Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in his son’s name since he could not operate stores that administer SNAP benefits due to previous convictions of food stamp fraud.Authorities alsodiscoveredthat Salem sold uninspected meat and allowed customers to use their food stamp benefits to purchase the meat, which had not been presented before the Department of Agriculture (USDA) for inspection.Salem often slaughtered lambs and goats at a farm on his home’s property, then sold the meat from those animals to SNAP recipients for a profit while disposing the blood and bodily fluids from those slaughtered animals into the Black River, investigators said.The profits from the illegal meat sales and food stamp transactions would then bedepositedback into the gas station accounts, which allowed Salem and his son, Mohamed Salem, 32, to place the funds into bank accounts in their names, investigators said.Amin Salem — who had prior convictions of food stamp fraud, money laundering, and mail fraud — also had an AR-15 rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun in his possession.Mohamed Salem and family business partner Zahran al-Qadan, 55, also face money laundering charges in connection with the scheme.Mohamed also faces additional charges, including trafficking counterfeit goods and using laundered money to carry out real estate transactions.“This father and son duo engaged in various illegalities to include stealing from every taxpaying citizen by engaging in food stamp fraud, a program designed to help those in need,” said FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Robert E. Hughes. “Salem put others at risk by selling unsanitary, unregulated food.”"

6638734931,http://www.breitbart.com/news/ap-fact-check-pruitt-takes-credit-for-obama-era-cleanups/,AP FACT CHECK: Pruitt takes credit for Obama-era cleanups,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Scott Pruitt has something to boast about when it comes to the Environmental Protection Agency’s record on cleaning up toxic sites since he took over the agency. But it’s a boast only made possible by achievements of the Obama administration.A look at his statement on the subject at a House hearing Thursday:PRUITT: “We have removed over three times the number of polluted sites of contaminated communities across the country as compared to the previous administration for 2017.” — House testimony.THE FACTS: He is taking credit for work largely completed when Barack Obama was president.The EPA declared seven cleanups complete from its Superfund priority list last year, compared with two sites delisted the year before.But records show that construction work at all seven sites cited by Pruitt’s EPA, such as removing soil or drilling wells to suck out contaminated groundwater, was completed years before Pruitt was confirmed as the agency’s chief in February.Removing sites from the list is a procedural step that occurs after monitoring data show that remaining levels of harmful contaminates meet cleanup targets, which were often set by the EPA decades ago.An analysis of EPA records by The Associated Press in January shows that the seven sites delisted last year fell short of the average pace set under the administrations of Obama and George W. Bush, even in their opening years. Pruitt told lawmakers “we are on pace to remove (meaning delist) as many as 10 times the number of polluted sites” in 2018.Trump’s proposed 2018 budget sought to cut the Superfund program by 30 percent but Congress did not go along. EPA lists more than 1,300 Superfund sites that are at various stages of cleanup.___Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bdFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheckEDITOR’S NOTE _ A look at the veracity of claims by political figures"

1883115542,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA9IKC501,Neglected old Australian woman suffers brutal fate,"(AP) Neglected old Australian woman suffers brutal fateBy KRISTEN GELINEAUAssociated PressSYDNEYBy the time the ambulance showed up to the house, the old woman’s screams were, as the paramedics would later tell it, already at a 10 out of 10.On a bed in the foyer lay 88-year-old Cynthia Thoresen, her eyes screwed up in agony, her skin covered in feces, with a broken leg gone untended for weeks.The fact that Cynthia even lived in the house was a surprise to the neighbors. None had seen her. None had any idea she’d spent her final days in hellish pain after a fall. None knew that her daughter and caretaker, Marguerite Thoresen, had waited at least three weeks, and up to three months, before calling for help.In the end, Cynthia Thoresen joined a large and growing cohort of elderly people across the world who live, and increasingly die, in silence, left to fend for themselves against a problem society has barely begun to notice: Elder abuse.This type of abuse, which often includes neglect, is still so hidden that it is hard to quantify. But the broad picture gleaned from hundreds of interviews and dozens of studies reviewed by The Associated Press is clear: Tens of millions of elders have become victims, trapped between governments and families, neither of which have figured out how to protect or provide for them.___EDITOR’S NOTE _ As the world ages faster than ever, who will care for the old? This story is part of an occasional series about elder neglect and abuse worldwide.___Most of the elderly live with family or at home, and researchers estimate at least 4 to 10 percent of them, and probably a lot more, are abused. Even by the lowest count, that means 30 million people.The demographics alone show the problem is growing. By the year 2050, there will be more old people than children for the first time in history.Australia, where Cynthia Thoresen lived, is a wealthy nation and considered progressive, but even in high-income countries, the abuse rate is 4 to 6 percent, according to the World Health Organization. And even here, the system repeatedly failed Cynthia, in life and in death.“Nothing in the past has disturbed me like this job disturbed me,” paramedic Christopher Curtis told police. “I’ve not seen anyone, regardless of their age, that could withstand the level of pain inflicted by a fractured femur for five seconds, let alone three weeks.”___In a way, aging in today’s world can be a slow slide into invisibility: Older people often say they exist in the shadows, their words dismissed, their cares unheeded.Information on elder abuse lags decades behind research on child abuse. Only a handful of countries legally require the reporting of suspected elder abuse, compared to dozens for child abuse. In the U.S., the government passed the Elder Justice Act in 2010, compared to 1974 for its counterpart on child abuse.The data varies wildly across cultures because researchers can’t agree on who is an elder, let alone what elder abuse is. But other statistics are telling: Only one in five older people worldwide has a pension. Elders figure prominently among the more than 100 million who fall into poverty each year because of health-care expenses. And the suicide rate among men over 75 is the highest in the world.Cynthia Thoresen’s story can be pieced together through legal documents, newspaper clippings, interviews and police testimony. Marguerite Thoresen did not answer repeated requests, by phone, email and letter, for comment.Cynthia’s world began to shrink with a fall that left her dependent.She moved into Marguerite’s home in Perth, and in 2001, Marguerite applied for a government carer’s benefit that came to around $500 every two weeks. Once the payments started, the government welfare agency, Centrelink, never asked for further medical updates on Cynthia, Marguerite said.Cynthia vanished from the health care system. Medicare records show that for years she saw doctors and took prescription medications. But in 2003, Cynthia’s medical treatment stopped.Marguerite’s explanation: “Well, she didn’t say she was ill.”___In 2007, Marguerite moved with her husband, daughter, grandsons and mother to a Brisbane suburb.There, Cynthia’s world shrank to a pinpoint.In the 18 months Cynthia lived there, no visitors were invited inside. Cynthia did not talk on the phone or write letters. Her only other close relative, her son Thorolf, lived nearly 1,700 kilometers (1,000 miles) away, and dementia left her confused at times.One morning, probably in late November 2008, the family found Cynthia on the floor next to a pool of liquid.Marguerite figured she’d sprained her knee and kept her in bed, with a towel underneath to soak up excrement. She said she called an ambulance on Dec. 17, 2008 because her mother had stopped eating.She said the screaming only began when she moved Cynthia to a bed near the front door.Up until this point, she said, her mother seemed fine.___When Cynthia arrived at the hospital, her chafed skin was covered in bedsores and feces. Her toenails were overgrown and curling. Her swollen right leg was 10 centimeters (4 inches) shorter than her left, the result of a fracture healing improperly.Marguerite didn’t ride to the hospital with her mother. She did not show up for three days.The break appeared to be between three and 12 weeks old. The fracture was too severe and the delay in treatment too long to operate.Cynthia died at 6:15 p.m. on Jan. 3, 2009. She was one week shy of her 89th birthday.The coroner would not hold the inquest hearing into her death until four years later.___In Australia, as in many places, experts say the legal system is not set up to prevent, catch or punish elder abuse.The few regions with mandatory elder abuse reporting laws _ including most U.S. states, some Canadian provinces and Israel _ still catch only a tiny fraction of cases. And even then, the victims seldom see justice.Only one case out of the hundreds Diane Pendergast investigated as Queensland’s Adult Guardian was prosecuted.“People won’t prosecute _ whether it’s police, whether it’s family members _ because it involves family business,” she says. “Because it’s private. Because there’s a level of abuse that’s tolerated in the community that none of us wishes was there. We all turn a blind eye.”The autopsy concluded Cynthia died from a blood clot in her lung, sparked by the leg fracture. Dr. Stephen Morrison, the medical expert, concluded Cynthia’s condition and the delay in treatment was “neglectful to the point of cruelty in a distressed, demented and totally dependent patient.”Police contemplated charges of manslaughter, failure to provide the necessities of life, negligent acts causing harm, torture. But they decided the doctors couldn’t say beyond a reasonable doubt that Marguerite’s care had caused Cynthia’s death.So they closed the case.The key to Cynthia’s story lies with her daughter, Marguerite.The few people who know her describe her as introverted, odd but compassionate. She took in unwanted rabbits and ran an information service dedicated to their care. In a poem on the website, Marguerite writes:“Miserable howling pierces the night as the pet shop puppy cries a lament that nobody hears … The solitary victim left to cry alone.”___At the inquest on May 13, 2013, the coroner, Christine Clements, and the lawyer, Emily Cooper, grilled Marguerite for two hours. Through it all, she seemed detached.The excrement? There wasn’t that much. Cynthia’s screams? They weren’t that loud. The stench of urine? The result of her grandson running around without a diaper.She hadn’t accompanied her mother in the ambulance because she didn’t think it was allowed. She hadn’t visited for three days because her husband was too busy to join her.Marguerite finally conceded that perhaps she should have called an ambulance a week earlier. But no sooner.Cooper asked point-blank: Had Marguerite provided Cynthia appropriate care?“I believe that up to that last fall, she had very good care,” Marguerite replied. “I did my best.”And after the fall?“I probably could have judged the situation better.”___In the coroner’s 15-page report, the word “pain” appears 30 times.“It is an appalling thought to consider the pain endured by Cynthia Thoresen during this period when she was totally at the mercy of her daughter’s inadequate regime of `care’,” Clements wrote.Marguerite’s brother and sister-in-law declined interviews. Police refused to talk. Centrelink referred AP to the family and housing department, which refused to address possible changes in policy. The state attorney general referred the case to the public prosecutor’s office, which also refused to comment.From all involved: Silence.“With elder abuse, no one wants to touch it. Any nugget of information that might lead to revelations of abuse is always swept under the carpet,” says Lynda Saltarelli, founder of Aged Care Crisis, an Australian advocacy group. “As a community, we should all hang our heads in shame over the fact that it’s remained hidden.”___In the end, the lawyer concluded there was no evidence of malice from Marguerite, but her explanations were “quite ridiculous.”The coroner mused aloud about the troubling death of such a dependent, vulnerable elderly person, and asked, “How as a society can we help such an event occurring?”Did it come down to changing the law? Was it about moral, family, social responsibility? Did Marguerite herself need help?The coroner let out a small sigh. Her voice was resigned.“I don’t know.”Her words were met with silence. Marguerite had left the room.An interactive is available at http://hosted.ap.org/interactives/2013/global-aging/index.html.A portrait gallery is at http://hosted.ap.org/interactives/2013/old-world-portraits/index.html."

The allegations challenge one of Google’s core defenses of its policies, which is that unlike Apple’s iOS rules Android allows both competing app stores and side-loading apps directly.The lawsuit is claiming that Google’s supposed openness is a facade and while customers technically have the choice of where to get their apps from, Google’s business practices have prevented a viable app store competitor from emerging. “Google felt deeply threatened when Samsung began to revamp its own app store, the Samsung Galaxy Store,” the suit claims.The suit describes Google’s approach to the competing store as “a threat it needed to preemptively quash.” The suit outlines a range of tactics Google allegedly used to prevent Samsung’s store from becoming a viable competitor. It claims that Google used revenues hare agreements with Android phone manufacturers that “outright prohibited” pre-installing some other app stores, and that it made “a direct attempt to pay Samsung to abandon relationships with top developers and scale back competition through the Samsung Galaxy Store.”As well as attempting to nullify Samsung’s store directly, the attorneys general claim that Googled worked with app developers to encourage them not to distribute their apps outside of the Play Store, effectively paying them off while imposing distribution restrictions on their apps.Read more atthe Verge here.Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

7566784553,https://www.breitbart.com/news/july-us-jobs-report-shows-solid-gains-amid-trade-frictions/,July US jobs report shows solid gains amid trade frictions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers slowed their hiring in July but still added a solid 164,000 jobs to an economy that appears poised to extend its decade-long expansion.The unemployment rate remained at 3.7% for a second straight month, the government said Friday. Average hourly earnings rose 3.2% from a year ago, up from a 3% year-over-year gain in June.Though the pace of hiring has slowed this year, one reason is that a growing share of Americans already have jobs. Unemployment is near a half-century low. The overall U.S. economy remains on firm footing, and last month the expansion became the longest on record.“This report is a sigh of relief,” said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist for the jobs site Glassdoor. “It had good solid numbers and was largely in line with expectations.”Still, the economy has faced some tumult as President Donald Trump has escalated his trade conflict with China. On Thursday, Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports beginning in September. That move could slow U.S. economic growth if the tariffs remain in effect indefinitely, especially if Beijing retaliates as expected.U.S. consumers will likely feel the pain. Trump’s earlier tariffs had been designed to minimize the impact on ordinary Americans by focusing on industrial goods. But the new tariffs will hit a vast range of consumer products.The Federal Reserve has acted to try to sustain the expansion in part because some of the benefits are only now reaching America’s lower-income communities. The Fed on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in a decade to try to counter the impact of Trump’s trade wars, stubbornly low inflation and global weakness.As Trump’s trade conflicts escalate, the economy and the job market could weaken. Recession fears could increase. But for now, hiring appears solid.“We’re really at a sweet spot despite all the negatives swirling around us,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. Frick said the slowdown in monthly job gains was organic given the size of past gains and the length of expansion.Nevertheless, the trade frictions have been weighing on global financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 300 points in late-morning trading.“The sometimes backward -looking nature” of the jobs data make it less relevant for the financial markets given the possibility of additional tariffs against China that could raise prices for U.S. consumers, said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income.In Friday’s employment report for July, the government revised down its estimate of job growth for May and June by a combined 41,000. Over the past six months, the economy has added jobs at a monthly average of roughly 141,000. That is down from a monthly average of 236,000 during the same period last year.One clear positive is that wage gains have been strongest for poorer workers.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that one reason to cut rates was to sustain the longest expansion in U.S. history because people living in distressed communities finally “are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.”Lower-wage industries reported that average hourly earnings in those sectors jumped 4.6% from a year ago, considerably above the 2.5% pay gain for higher-wage industries, according to an analysis of the jobs report by Martha Gimbel, research director at the jobs site Indeed.In July, several industry sectors posted solid gains. Health care added a robust 30,400 jobs. Restaurants and bars added 15,400 jobs. Local governments contributed 14,000 jobs, primarily in education. The finance and insurance industry added 13,900.The manufacturing sector, though, has been struggling with declines in output. Manufacturers posted healthy gains of 16,000 jobs in July, though most of the growth was in the transportation sector that could soon be hit by auto plant layoffs.Other areas showed some signs of weakness. Construction companies added just 4,000 workers. The transportation and warehousing sector added just 300 jobs. Retailers shed 3,600.Though it is growing consistently, the economy does appear to be sliding into a slower phase. The gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services produced in the United States — grew at a decent if unspectacular 2.1% annual rate in the April-June quarter, down from a 3.1% pace in the January-March period.Consumer spending increased at a 4.3% annual rate and helped propel much of the growth. But business capital investment declined for the first time in three years, a likely sign that Trump’s aggressive use of tariffs against China and other countries has slowed corporations’ expansion plans.Home sales have fallen as high prices have kept many people out despite the benefits of low mortgage rates and job gains. Sales of existing homes have tumbled 2.2% over the past 12 months, according to the National Association of Realtors.Factories have also been coping with a slowdown. In part, that’s because the global economy has weakened and the president’s tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods — and threats to add more — have disrupted supply chains.  The Fed said this month that manufacturing output has improved just 0.4% from a year ago after having declined over the past six months.There are signs, though, that consumers are optimistic. The Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence last month reached its best reading since November. A higher percentage of Americans anticipate pay raises in the next six months.___AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report."

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 420 million hectares (1.6 million square miles) of forest — an area larger than the EU — were destroyed between 1990 and 2020.___Follow AP’s climate coverage athttps://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

5650701921,http://www.breitbart.com/news/macron-le-pen-clash-in-first-french-election-tv-debate/,"Macron, Le Pen clash in first French election TV debate","PARIS (AP) — The two front-runners for the French presidency clashed spectacularly in the campaign’s first televised debate between leading candidates Monday night.All five candidates landed punches during vigorous discussion on the big issues for France: jobs, terrorism, immigration, Europe.But the faceoff between independent centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right populist Marine Le Pen provided political theater, even moments of high drama in pitting two opposing visions of France.Macron’s performance, in particular, was being closely watched. One of the big surprises of the election has been the success of the former economics minister’s new-look campaign, positioning himself as a centrist alternative to France’s traditional left-right politics.But Le Pen, the anti-immigration, anti-European Union leader of the National Front, was looking for opportunities to pounce. With polls suggesting that she and Macron could be direct rivals in the decisive May 7 runoff of the two-round election, both sought to score points against each other.As Macron was discussing foreign policy, Le Pen portrayed him as wishy-washy, muttering: “It’s empty, completely empty.”“We don’t know what you want,” she said.Macron proved during the three-hour evening debate that overran and spilled past midnight that he can defend himself. With limited experience of public office, he sought to portray himself as presidential and hard to push around.Some of the most heated exchanges centered on the place of religion in France and the separation of church and state.Macron reacted vigorously when Le Pen accused him of being in favor of Muslim swimwear — essentially suggesting that her rival isn’t really committed to France’s secular values and policies.“I don’t need a ventriloquist,” he retorted. “When I have something to say, I say it clearly.”He, in turn, accused Le Pen of using Islam to divide the French. Le Pen wants all visible religious symbols worn by people, including Muslim headscarves and Jewish kippahs, banned from public.“The trap you are falling into, Madame Le Pen, with your provocations is to divide society,” Macron said.Macron also used humor to defuse Le Pen’s attacks. After a thinly veiled dig from Le Pen suggesting that the former banker would be beholden to financial lobbies if elected, Macron told her: “You’d be bored without me.”While they were feisty, conservative candidate Francois Fillon was noticeably and unusually restrained. Once considered a leading contender to move into the presidency’s Elysee Palace, Fillon’s campaign has been badly hurt by accusations that his wife and children were paid with public money for jobs they allegedly did not do, which he denies. The ex-prime minister appeared weary and at times absent during the debate.“I may have made mistakes. I have defects. Who doesn’t? But I have experience,” Fillon said.Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon and far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, both looking to boost their poll numbers, were the first to take swipes at Le Pen.Hamon described Le Pen’s attitude as “sickening” after she spoke of French schools as “a daily nightmare,” so dangerous that pupils attend with “fear in their stomachs.”Melenchon interrupted Le Pen as she was calling for boosted French-language teaching.“How do you learn French, dear madam? By speaking it!” he said.Of the 11 candidates in the election, only the five who are expected to be the largest vote-getters in the first round were included in the debate.The first-round vote is set for April 23; the top two candidates go to the May 7 runoff."
9471135128,http://www.breitbart.com/news/climate-tragedy-vanuatu-to-relocate-dozens-of-villages/,Climate ‘tragedy’: Vanuatu to relocate ‘dozens’ of villages,"Vanuatu is drawing up plans to relocate “dozens” of villages within the next two years, as they come under threat from rising seas, the Pacific nation’s climate chief told AFP Thursday.Climate Change Minister Ralph Regenvanu said dealing with the impact of global warming was a major challenge facing Vanuatu’s 300,000 inhabitants who live on a chain of islands strung out between Australia and Fiji.Regenvanu said the response would inevitably involve relocating long-established communities from coastal areas, where climate change is pushing sea levels higher and fuelling more extreme storms.He said Vanuatu’s government has identified “dozens” of villages in “at-risk areas” to be relocated “within the next 24 months” while other settlements have also been earmarked to move in the longer term.“Climate displacement of populations is the main feature of our future. We have to be ready for it and plan for it now,” said Regenvanu, who took over his ministerial portfolio after a snap election in October.“It’s going to be a huge challenge and a huge tragedy for many people who would have to leave their ancestral land to move to other places, but that’s the reality.”Low-lying Pacific island nations, like Vanuatu, are already experiencing the impact of climate change.Half of Vanuatu’s population was affected when Cyclone Pam battered the capital Port Vila in 2015, killing a dozen people, destroying crops and leaving thousands homeless.Vanuatu is ranked as one of the countries most susceptible to natural disasters like earthquakes, storm damage, flooding and tsunamis, according to the annual World Risk Report.Other Pacific nations are also looking to move under-threat communities, including Fiji where dozens of villages have been earmarked for relocation owing to the impacts of the climate crisis.Scientists predict sea levels in the Pacific will rise between 25–58 centimetres (9-22 inches) by the middle of the century.That is a devastating prospect for Vanuatu, where around 60 percent of the population live within a kilometre of the coast.‘All sorts of threats’Regenvanu wants coastal defences strengthened.“Our greatest challenge right now on Vanuatu is basically keeping our populations safe,” he said.“We’re finding more and more that our people are subject to all sorts of threats from volcanoes, flooding, cyclones and so on.“So we have to engage now in moving populations and building resilient infrastructure so that our people are safer in the coming years.”Vanuatu already has experience of moving its people.In 2005, it was one of the first Pacific nations to move an entire community on the northern island of Tegua from a flood-prone coastal area to higher ground.And in 2017, all 11,000 people living on Ambae, an island in the country’s north, were ferried by a rag-tag armada of boats to other isles after the Manaro Voui volcano erupted, raining down rock and ash on villagers.In May, Vanuatu’s parliament declared a climate change emergency and its government is seeking to speed up global action by leading efforts to take the matter to the Hague-based International Court of Justice.Regenvanu attended the UN’s COP27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh last month, where a landmark deal was struck to help vulnerable countries cope with climate change by providing a “loss and damage” fund.The nations attending COP27 repeated a commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels, but Regenvanu said the pledges did not go far enough.“Basically, there’s not enough commitment to reducing emissions,” he said.“And so we’re going to see temperatures increase beyond 1.5 degrees which we know will be disastrous for the Pacific — we have to focus on adaptation and particularly loss and damage.”"
4722844613,http://www.breitbart.com/news/gucci-to-unify-sexes-in-one-catwalk-show/,Gucci to unify sexes in one catwalk show,"Milan (AFP) – Gucci is taking its recent embrace of androgynous looks to its natural conclusion by combining its womenswear and menswear collections into unified catwalk shows from next year.The move, which could herald the end of the current system of separate menswear and womenswear weeks in the style capitals of the world, is the latest bold step by Alessandro Michele, the creative director credited with putting Gucci back at the top of the fashion tree.It was announced by Gucci President and CEO Marco Bizzarri at the New York Times International Luxury Conference in Versailles, France.The first unified show will take place at Gucci’s new Milan headquarters at Via Mecenate — but the crucial issue of the timing of the collection has yet to be worked out.Michele said: “It seems only natural to me to present my men’s and women’s collections together. It’s the way I see the world today. It will not necessarily be an easy path and will certainly present some challenges, but I believe it will give me the chance to move towards a different kind of approach to my story telling.”The Gucci move comes as fashion’s established calendar is under pressure from the “see now, buy now” trend which has seen some leading brands start releasing their clothes immediately they appear on the catwalk rather than at the start of the season they are intended for, typically four months after the catwalk shows.Gucci said it would not be joining that trend, citing “the necessities of the creative and production process in luxury fashion.”Bizzarri added: “Alessandro Michele has in fact always presented his men’s and women’s collections together, so this is a very natural progression. Moving to one show each season will significantly help to simplify many aspects of our business.“Maintaining two separate, disconnected calendars has been a result of tradition rather than practicality.”"

Lon Milka said the parents thought the milkshakes tasted odd and only consumed about a quarter of them, but it was enough to make them fall asleep for the night.Milka said the parents took a drug test and confronted their daughter, who admitted drugging the shakes to circumvent their Internet restriction.The teen and her friend, whose names were not released because they are 16 and 15 years old, were arrested Monday on charges of conspiracy and willfully mingling a pharmaceutical into food."
724529093,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2012/06/13/Russia-presses-Iran-ahead-of-nuclear-talks,Russia presses Iran ahead of nuclear talks,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov flew into Iran on Wednesday for a brief visit to discuss upcoming international talks over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme.The trip preceded a new round of negotiations between Iran and the major powers that is to be held in Moscow next Monday and Tuesday.In a joint news conference after meeting his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, Lavrov revealed little of what they talked about.He reiterated Russia’s opposition to unilateral sanctions imposed by Western countries that are hurting Iran’s oil export-dependent economy.Salehi said he was “optimistic” about the prospects of the Moscow negotiations, despite two unproductive rounds in Istanbul and Baghdad earlier this year.He added: “In this process, it can slow down at times, then accelerate. But we are optimistic about the final result.”Lavrov was also to meet Iran’s lead negotiator, Saeed Jalili, before flying out, according to Iranian officials.US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that the Iranians “are under tremendous pressure from the Russians and the Chinese to come to Moscow prepared to respond” to proposals by the world powers to alleviate the showdown over Tehran’s nuclear activities.She said: “The Russians have made it very clear that they expect the Iranians to advance the discussion in Moscow. Not just to come, listen and leave. We will know once it happens.”Moscow is the most sympathetic to Tehran among the six powers negotiating with it in the talks, although it has sided with the West in expressing fears that Iran could be pursuing the development of a nuclear weapons capability, which has raised the spectre of military strikes by the United States or Israel.The so-called P5+1 group of nations — comprising UN Security Council permanent members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, plus Germany — offered a package of proposals to Iran in the last round, in Baghdad in May.They called for Iran to halt its enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, ship out its stockpile of 20-percent uranium and halt enrichment at its fortified Fordo facility.In return, they offered nuclear cooperation, spare parts for Iran’s dilapidated passenger aircraft fleet and an easing of a EU ban on tanker insurance that hinders oil sales to Asia.Iran’s negotiators rejected the package as grossly insufficient. They countered with a list of their own issues that included many non-nuclear topics such as regional security, and the demand that the P5+1 override several UN Security Council resolutions by agreeing that Iran has a “right” to uranium enrichment.The distance between the two sides’ positions almost caused the Baghdad round to collapse, but last-minute discussions managed to eke out an agreement for the Moscow round, which will take place just two weeks before an EU embargo on Iranian oil imports is due to to be fully imposed.In the past few days, Iranian officials have softened slightly their stance by saying the issue of 20-percent enriched uranium could still be up for negotiation — but only if the concession offered in return was of the same importance."

6555716791,http://www.breitbart.com/news/us-aviation-authorities-review-helicopter-rules-after-crash/,US aviation authorities review helicopter rules after crash,"New York (AFP) – The US Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it will review regulations for “doors off” helicopter flights — popular with photographers — following a crash that killed five people in New York City.The FAA “will conduct a top-to-bottom review of its rules governing these flights to examine any potential misapplication that could create safety gaps for passengers,” it said.Helicopter flights with the doors open provide passengers with a more direct view of the skyline than flights with the aircraft’s doors shut.For now, the FAA has banned “doors off” flights that use restraints that cannot be easily released, which apparently played a significant role in the deaths of five passengers when a Eurocopter AS350 crashed into the East River on Sunday.Only the pilot survived the crash of the helicopter, which was operated by tourism group Liberty.Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said that while the pilot was able to free himself, the passengers were “all tied tightly in harnesses that had to be cut and removed.”"
6513392884,http://www.breitbart.com/news/neymar-arrives-in-brazil-for-foot-surgery/,Neymar arrives in Brazil for foot surgery,"Rio de Janeiro (AFP) – Brazilian superstar Neymar flew into Rio de Janeiro early Thursday ahead of an operation on his fractured foot that will rule him out for up to three months, casting a long shadow over Paris Saint-Germain and Brazil’s World Cup preparations.The world’s most expensive player, 26, arrived on an Air France flight from Paris and left in a wheelchair, a photo taken by one of his fellow passengers showed.Dressed in a black hoodie, a black baseball cap and wearing sunglasses, the PSG star smiled and took selfies with passengers, before leaving on a private jet to an undisclosed destination.Surgery will take place Saturday, national team surgeon Rodrigo Lasmar said. But despite the hurry to put Neymar under the knife at a hospital in Belo Horizonte, he won’t be back on the field soon.“The (recovery) period will be around two and a half to three months,” Lasmar, said after arriving with the player on the same Air France plane.The injury has not only ruled Neymar out of PSG’s do-or-die Champions League clash with Real Madrid but now threatens the much fancied Brazilian national side’s build-up to the World Cup, which starts June 14.On Tuesday, the Brazilian’s father had claimed the player would be out for “at least six weeks”.– Tiny bone, big problem –Neymar suffered a hairline fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his right foot as well as a twisted ankle late in PSG’s 3-0 win over Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday.Speaking to ESPN in Brazil before PSG’s announcement, the player’s father, Neymar Senior, said: “PSG know that they will not be able to count on Neymar for the upcoming matches.”PSG coach Unai Emery had said earlier that there remained a “small chance” of getting him back in time to face Real next Tuesday, March 6. That chance has now gone.PSG lost 3-1 in the first leg in Spain two weeks ago and are in danger of being knocked out of the competition in the last 16 for the second season running.Neymar appeared to be in tears as he was stretchered off the field at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.He has scored 28 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for PSG since his world-record 222 million-euro ($264 million) move from Barcelona last August.– Brazilian jitters –Brazilians care little about the impact on PSG. Their attention is entirely trained on the World Cup, where they have ambitions of walking away with a sixth title.“We just might have lost the World Cup last Sunday,” one radio commentator, Milton Neves of Bandnews FM, said Wednesday.Images of Sunday’s fateful duel between Neymar and Marseille player Bouna Sarr were being shown incessantly on TV, often in slo-mo, before he was stretchered off.Newspapers featured close-up illustrations detailing Neymar’s foot and ankle.“I don’t think we can really talk about fears of him not being at the World Cup. But there is a noticeable haste to find a solution so that Neymar will have recovered in time,” an ESPN Brasil sports commentator, Mauro Cezar Pereira, told AFP."

5868632574,http://www.breitbart.com/news/50-years-after-sgt-pepper-rock-world-still-enjoys-the-show/,"50 years after ‘Sgt. Pepper,’ rock world still enjoys the show","New York (AFP) – Fifty years ago, The Beatles transformed from floppy-haired boy wonders who wanted to hold your hand to abstruse philosophers whose vision spanned civilizations. And the effect is still being felt.“Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” has been called the original concept album and even the greatest album of all time.Either way, its release half a century ago represented a landmark in music history, with stars once focused on churning out radio-friendly singles newly imagining albums as intricate pieces of art.The anniversary of the album, which came out on June 2, 1967 in the United States shortly after its British release, has set off a revival of “Sgt. Pepper” which will include weekend commemorations in The Beatles’s native Liverpool.A reissued edition, with a dynamic mix by the son of Beatles producer George Martin, is forecast to top the next weekly chart in Britain, where “Sgt. Pepper” was already the third top-selling album ever.“We were always being told, ‘You’re gonna lose all your fans with this one,’” Paul McCartney, the driving force behind the album, told British magazine Mojo for the anniversary.“And we’d say, ‘Well, we’ll lose some but we’ll gain some. We’ve gotta advance,’” he said.– Start of modern mixing –The album was rooted in a subtle irony. The Beatles, the quintessential pop foursome, performed in character as another, fictional band — “We’re Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band / We hope you will enjoy the show,” the opening track declares.The album was recorded over a then unthinkable five months as Martin made use of early mixing equipment. The Beatles brought out instruments from an organ to a harmonium to an 18th-century piccolo trumpet, which McCartney had spotted at a televised Bach concert.On “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” likely the album’s most recognizable track, the musical key rapidly shifted and John Lennon’s voice drifted higher as the recording of his voice was slowed down.George Harrison, freshly inspired from a retreat to India, played the sitar to merge ragas with Western pop on “Within You Without You” as he reflected on the spiritual quest to control the ego.Adding to the mystique was groundbreaking cover art. Instead of glossy photos then in vogue, The Beatles appeared as a brass band surrounded by a motley assortment of historical and contemporary figures from composers to writers to actors.Even in an age before the internet, the cover spawned conspiracy theories — in particular that McCartney was dead because of a misinterpretation of a badge he was wearing.Many fans saw hidden meanings in the songs, such as seeing LSD in “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” The quest for secrets was not entirely off the mark, with McCartney later revealing that the album featured a dog whistle inaudible to humans.– Birth of artistic rock –Concept albums were not entirely new. Jazz, not to mention classical music, had long sought unifying themes. The Beach Boys a year earlier had released “Pet Sounds,” whose tracks were tied together by an aesthetic, if not a narrative.Beach Boy leader Brian Wilson was said to have been devastated by the success of “Sgt. Pepper,” contributing to a breakdown as he shelved his mythically unfinished “Smile” album.“Sgt. Pepper” would have a major influence in years to come as more rock artists conceived of concept albums including The Who and Pink Floyd to, in more recent times, Radiohead and Beyonce.Roger Waters, the force behind Pink Floyd’s “The Wall,” said he heard “Sgt. Pepper” for the first time on a car radio and he pulled over to listen in amazement.The Beatles sent a message that “we could be free artists and that there was a value in that freedom,” Waters told US public television.Rolling Stone magazine ranked “Sgt. Pepper” as the greatest album of all time on its widely read, if inherently controversial, list.Yet the influence of “Sgt. Pepper” was not immediate. “Sgt. Pepper” kicked off the so-called Summer of Love, with the freshly psychedelic Beatles offering a soundtrack for free-spirited young people.But by late 1967 rock poet Bob Dylan had returned to his folk roots. The Beatles’s great rivals the Rolling Stones also went experimental with “Their Satanic Majesties Request” but by a year later were back to swaggering blues rock.Stones guitarist Keith Richards remains one unconvinced by “Sgt. Pepper.” In a 2015 interview, he said The Beatles “got carried away” and made “a mishmash of rubbish.”"

Kelley.The 61-year-old writer and producer discussed the possibility of Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley returning on the HBO series in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.“We’re kicking it around,” Kelley said of the prospect. “If we feel that the material warrants it, we’ll do it.”“Everybody’s game for getting the band back together, but we want to make sure that we’ve got the music to justify it,” he explained. “That decision hasn’t been made yet, and it’ll be story-driven when it is.”Big Little Lies is based on the Liane Moriarty novel of the same name, which was adapted as a seven-episode miniseries this year. Kelley confirmed a second season largely depends on Moriarty, who may have a larger role in future seasons.“I’m certainly open to it,” he said. “I think [Liane], for the book, was game to say, ‘Okay, it’s your baby. Run with it now.’ But she’s a great writer, and she also writes excellent dialogue, so if she wanted to jump over to the screenwriting side of the fence, we’d welcome her.”Witherspoon, who played Madeline Mackenzie on the show, previously told E! News a second season is a “possibility.” She reiterated her interest in the project in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Tuesday.“It’s sort of up to Liane Moriarty — she has to figure out if she sees a future for the characters — but we’re definitely open to it,” the 41-year-old actress said.Witherspoon is focused for now on her new TV series with Friends alum Jennifer Aniston. The actresses will team on an untitled project focused on a New York morning show."

6495687334,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2012/04/15/sarah-silverman-abortion/,Shock Comic Sarah Silverman's Latest Tweet Mocks Abortion,"People who enjoy great comedy know that the biggest laughs are rooted in truth, which is why Sarah Silverman, that irreverent purveyor of jaw-droppingly sick humor, is so hilarious – albeit to a tiny group of people.Only a liberal woman of Silverman’s brilliance would have the perverted ingenuity to exploit social media for laughs by mocking the slaughter of innocents. If Hideki Tojo, a man responsible for killing 5,000,000 civilians during World War II, were alive today, he probably would be one of Silverman’s biggest fans.Worried that Roe v. Wade could be overturned, and to call attention to the “Republican War on Women,” Silverman recently made comedic use of two iPhone photos, Twitter, and a burrito.Showing off her abilities, Silverman tweeted side-by-side “before-and-after” photos of herself. One photo, post-burrito, depicted Silverman appearing to be six months pregnant. The “after” photo showed Silverman with her previously-bloated stomach flat as a board.The @SarahKSilverman photograph was accompanied by a caption thatread, “Got a quickie aborsh in case R v W gets overturned.” Now how side-splittingly funny is that?Liberals in general are a comical group. But a high-profile comedian like Silverman throwing her burrito-assisted weight behind the right to choose and making a lighthearted political statement with a pre/post abortion snapshot gag, in liberal circles, is probably heralded as pure genius. Who knows, maybe the edgy Twitter recognition will win Silverman anotherCreative Arts Emmy.Surprisingly, her pro-choice tweet was not her first public commemoration of Roe v. Wade. On her Comedy Central show, Silverman had already starred in anamusing “Abortion Montage”where she reminisced about her own three abortions whileGreen Day’s “Time of Your Life”provided a faux-poignant soundtrack for double the laughs.Furthermore, always fair-minded, Silverman simply refuses to discriminate. In the past, the Jewish comedian has even entertained her fans with genocide jokes. Sarah claims her grandmother survived a Nazi death camp. In her movie “Jesus is Magic” she expressed gratitude that grandma, whom Silverman claimed “sported a vanity tattoo that said ‘Bedazzled,'” stayed at “one of the better concentration camps.”Again – side-splitting!A philosophy that terrifies the pro-choice crowd is that of humorless conservatives who believe violently removing a tiny, living human being from its mother’s womb has no place in civil society, let alone stand-up comedy. Compounding that fear is the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney vowing that, if elected, he would “work to reverse Roe v. Wade” and leave the abortion issue decision “up to individual states and the Supreme Court.”With that in mind, it stands to reason that the more highly evolved connoisseurs of Silverman-style humor would “applaud the high-profile personality for using her trademark sarcasm to directly comment on the possibility the Roe v. Wade decision may be overturned in the U.S.”As a matter of fact, in response to the vile, disturbing “quickie aborsh” tweet, the bawdy Silverman has received a “wave of support from hundreds … voicing liberal pro-choice beliefs,” and kudos from those who appreciate a “strong and simple point about the ongoing War on Women.”More recently, confirming the Democrat view that he’s “wooden and robotic,” Romney expressed the straitlaced, puritanical view that “People of both political parties know that more than a million abortions a year cannot be squared with the good heart of America.” Somebody should inform the stodgy Romney that in liberal circles, abortion is not only a woman’s Constitutional right; it’s also outstanding fodder for some very funny jokesNonetheless, Romney and all his “good heart” claptrap has proven again that, besides being rich and out of touch, he obviously lacks the sense of humor that would have made Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, and Adi Amin enjoy the brand of abortion-based wittiness that has made a star out of Silverman, America’s queen of shock jocularity."

5595412706,http://www.breitbart.com/news/harley-davidson-may-differ-with-trump-on-trade-solution/,Harley-Davidson may differ with Trump on trade solution,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, which President Donald Trump singled out Tuesday when he mentioned trade barriers, may disagree with his proposed solution to the problem.Trump said in his speech to Congress that executives from Harley-Davidson told him they have trouble selling motorcycles outside of the United States because of high taxes.While other countries impose heavy taxes and tariffs on American products, the United States doesn’t do the same when importing other countries’ products, Trump said in the speech. He called for free, but fair, trade.But a lobbyist for Harley warned that imposing additional tariffs on foreign imports could end up hurting sales, in comments submitted to the Office of the United States Trade Representative earlier this year.In a Jan. 30 letter posted on the office’s website, Edward Moreland said Harley-Davidson opposes additional duties on the motorcycles imported from Europe because of the prospect of Europe raising their fees in response.“Harley-Davidson sells tens of thousands of motorcycles in Europe each year and retaliatory tariffs would result in a significant impact to the Motor Company’s business,” he wrote. The letter was in response to a list of products on which the United States was considering imposing tariffs to counter Europe’s refusal to accept U.S. beef.Harley-Davidson spokeswoman Pat Sweeney said Trump was correct that high taxes and tariffs in countries such as India and Indonesia put the company “at a competitive disadvantage.” But she didn’t immediately respond to a question about whether or not Moreland’s letter means the company opposes imposing tariffs on foreign products in other situations.Trump canceled a visit to Harley-Davidson’s Milwaukee facility last month, which was expected to draw a significant number of protesters. Instead, Harley executives traveled to Washington for the Feb. 2 meeting. Trump said the executives told him business was good but mentioned the difficulty of selling motorcycles abroad.“They told me — without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it — that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate,” Trump said of their meeting. “They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.”Harley-Davidson sales in India, which imposes high import taxes on all luxury motorcycles and cars, rose 30 percent in the past two years. The company began assembling some bikes in India in 2011 to reduce tariffs.___Associated Press writer Erik Schelzig contributed to this report.___Follow Cara Lombardo on Twitter at https://twitter.com/CaraRLombardo"

1256833337,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA61J6FG3,Remains of Boston Marathon bombing suspect claimed,"(AP) Remains of Boston Marathon bombing suspect claimedBy BRIDGET MURPHYAssociated PressBOSTONThe body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was the subject of a massive manhunt and died after a gunbattle with police, was claimed on Thursday.Department of Public Safety spokesman Terrel Harris said a funeral home retained by Tsarnaev’s family picked up the 26-year-old’s remains. He said he had no more information about plans for the remains.The medical examiner determined Tsarnaev’s cause of death on Monday, but officials said it wouldn’t become public until his remains were released and a death certificate was filed. It was unclear on Thursday evening whether the death certificate had been filed.Tsarnaev’s widow, Katherine Russell, who has been living with her parents in North Kingstown, R.I., learned this week that the medical examiner was ready to release his body and wanted it released to his side of the family, her attorney Amato DeLuca said days ago.Tsarnaev’s uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Maryland, said Tuesday night the family would take the body.“Of course, family members will take possession of the body,” Tsarni said. “We’ll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.”After the hearse believed to be carrying Tsarnaev’s body departed Boston, television stations reported that their helicopters followed it to the Dyer Lake Funeral Home in North Attleboro. About 20 protesters gathered outside the funeral home. An Associated Press photographer later saw a hearse leaving the home escorted by two police cars.Dyer-Lake Funeral Director Tim Nye told The Sun-Chronicle newspaper late Thursday that the body was only brought to his funeral home temporarily and was transported to another facility, but didn’t say where.Tsarnaev, who had appeared in surveillance photos wearing a black cap and was identified as Suspect No. 1, died days after the bombing.The April 15 bombing, using pressure cookers packed with explosives, nails, ball bearings and metal shards near the marathon’s finish line, killed three people and injured more than 260 others. Authorities said Tsarnaev and his younger brother later killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus police officer and carjacked a driver, who escaped.Authorities said that during the gunbattle with police, the Tsarnaev brothers, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the United States about a decade ago, set off another pressure cooker bomb and tossed grenades before the older brother ran out of ammunition.Police said they tackled the older brother and began to handcuff him but had to dive out of the way at the last second when the younger brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, drove a stolen car at them. They said the younger brother ran over his brother’s body as he drove away from the scene to escape.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured later, wounded and bloody, hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a suburban Boston backyard. He is in a federal prison and faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill.The Tsarnaev brothers’ mother insists the allegations against them are lies.Three of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s friends, college classmates, were arrested and were accused of helping after the marathon bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his dormitory room before the FBI searched it.A top Republican senator on Thursday asked President Barack Obama’s administration to explain how one of the students entered the United States without a valid student visa.Sen. Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, in a three-page letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, asked for additional details about the student visa applications for Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, college roommates from Kazakhstan charged with obstruction of justice in the marathon bombing case, and how Tazhayakov was allowed to re-enter the United States in January.Tazhayakov was a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth when he left the country in December. In early January, his student visa status was terminated because he was academically dismissed by the university.The third student arrested, Robel Phillipos, was charged with willfully making materially false statements to federal law enforcement officials during a terrorism investigation.The lawyers for the Kazakh students said their clients had nothing to do with the bombing and were just as shocked by it as everyone else. Phillipos’ attorney said the only allegation against him was “he made a misrepresentation.”"

Others also danced and shouted slogans in New Delhi.The parents of handlebar-moustached Abhinandan were given a standing ovation by fellow passengers as they boarded a flight to Amritsar near Wagah to welcome their son.In India the experienced pilot’s release was seen as a diplomatic victory, but New Delhi warned that its military remained on “heightened” alert.On Thursday and Friday both countries continued to fire barrages across the Line of Control (LoC), the de-facto border dividing Kashmir, with mortar fire killing four people on the Indian side.They included three members of the same family — a mother and two children — when a mortar shell pulverised their house in Poonch district late Friday, police said.Indian troops also laid siege to a house in Handwara district in India’s only Muslim-majority state, believing they had killed two militants inside.However one survived, a police official told AFP. Hours later, when security forces went in to retrieve the bodies the man emerged from debris and opened fire, killing four soldiers before he was shot dead.“Influence of terrorists and terrorism has been curtailed and it is going to be curtailed even more. This is a New India,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi, facing a tough election due by May, said Friday.“This is an India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest,” he said.After the pilot’s release he tweeted: “The nation is proud of your exemplary courage… Hail to the motherland!”India’s junior foreign minister and former army chief, Vijay Kumar Singh, tweeted that the “welcome” release of the pilot was “the first of many steps that #Pakistan must take to reinforce their commitment to peace”.– ‘We need peace’ –Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule. Both claim it in full and have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory.India has half a million troops in the part it administers, with militants — backed by Islamabad, according to New Delhi — fighting for independence or a merger with Pakistan.Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have died since a revolt that broke out in 1989. Last year was the deadliest in a decade with almost 600 killed, monitors say, sparking anger among locals.“Poor people are getting killed and their homes are destroyed… We need peace,” Nagina Bano, one of 300 locals who attended the funeral on Friday for a woman killed in the cross-border bombardment, told AFP.A civilian was also killed during protests in Indian Kashmir, police told AFP.Alarming the international community, tensions escalated after the February 14 suicide bombing in Indian Kashmir, with the attack claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.Twelve days later Indian warplanes launched a strike inside undisputed Pakistani territory, claiming to have hit a militant camp.An infuriated Islamabad denied casualties or damage, but a day later launched its own incursion across the LoC.That sparked the dogfight which ended in both countries claiming they had shot down each other’s warplanes, and Abhinandan’s capture.The tensions prompted Pakistan to close down its airspace, disrupting thousands of travellers worldwide. Its major airports reopened on Friday.burs-stu/amu"

Miss Mokkedem said the coveralls cost £11 before the pandemic – but they charged £16 as market demand and rising cargo costs pushed up prices.There have been many similar cases of people with little to no relevant expertise suddenly being handed eye-wateringly large contracts. Often the equipment turned out to be useless to the point of unusability.Here isanother examplefromMailinvestigative reporter David Rose:Take Jonathon Bennett. As theMailreported this month, he is a veteran textile importer with extensive contacts in China, where most PPE is made. His bid to supply millions of masks in April was highly competitive – well below the Government’s ‘benchmark’ price.But the £253million contract went to Ayanda Capital, a firm with no experience which was charging almost twice as much. Worse, 50 million of their masks were of the wrong design.Mr Bennett has long suspected Ayanda won its contract because it was brokered by someone who until recently had been an adviser to Trade Secretary Liz Truss – an Ayanda associate called Andrew Mills.The NAO report confirms this. It was thanks to a “referral” by Mr Mills that Ayanda’s bid got the VIP treatment.The excuse being trotted out by the government is that all contracts were awarded with “due diligence” and that any delays in reporting publicly the details of these contracts was the result of problems caused by the pandemic.But Mr Justice Chamberlain, the judge who found against Hancock,saidthat this was “an excuse not a justification.”Where, though, are the consequences?Britain in 2021 appears to have become so detached from democratic transparency or accountability that is now apparently possible for a small number of Conservative government insiders to award multi-million contracts to favoured, but often unsuitable cronies — and get away with it.In any remotely functioning democracy, heads would roll for this scandal. Top of the list would be the power-crazed Health Secretary Matt Hancock who has been found in breach of the law by the High Court and who must ultimately bear responsibility for the billions of pounds’ worth of squandered taxpayers’ cash.The British people really deserve better than the corrupt, cruel, and outrageously authoritarian regime currently in control of their country. It doesn’t look like they’re going to get it any time soon.Follow Breitbart London on Facebook:Breitbart London"

Ending that drought at 26 years took bouncing back from the Capitals tying the score with 1:03 left in regulation and getting another big goal from leading scorer Carter Verhaeghe 2:46 into overtime to move on.Florida will face either the cross-state rival — and back-to-back defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning — or the Toronto Maple Leafs in the next round. They face off in Game 7 of that series Saturday.“They’re going to be big-time challenges,” interim coach Andrew Brunette said. “It will be a different kind of series.”This series included the Panthers rallying from a deficit to win the final three games. After Ryan Lomberg tied it in the second period in his return to the lineup, trade-deadline acquisition Claude Giroux evened things up in the third and captain Aleksander Barkov put them ahead before T.J. Oshie’s power-play goal sent the game to OT.After a league-high 29 comeback victories in the regular season and a dose of adversity in a tougher series than many anticipated, the Panthers were not shaken by the sudden turn of events.“We were just confident,” Huberdeau said. “We know we can score some goals. Obviously they tied it up, but that’s hockey. That’s how it happened the way we won here the last time, so that was the same thing. Obviously we stuck with it, and that’s the kind of team we are and we showed it.”Verheaghe’s OT goal was his team-leading sixth of the series and came after he missed the morning skate and was considered a game-time decision. Brunette said Verhaeghe “dug in deep and found a way to get it done.”That’s true about the entire team. Dogged by the reputation of losing in the playoffs, Florida’s core of Huberdeau, Barkov and top defenseman Aaron Ekblad that had fallen short three previous times finally got to soak in what it’s like to win a series.“It means a lot,” Barkov said. “There’s been a lot of talk about this and not winning any rounds, getting knocked out in the first round and stuff like that. Of course you don’t think about that, but it’s there. It’s not there anymore, so we’re happy about that and happy to be a part of it. But there’s still a long way to go to the point where we actually want to be.”The Capitals got there in 2018, winning the organization’s first Stanley Cup title. They have not won a playoff series since and got knocked out in the first round at home for the third time in that span.“I think you see how we played against the best team in the regular season,” Washington captain Alex Ovechkin said. “We have it, but we just blow it away. It is on us. ”The Panthers’ most recent series win came June 1, 1996, when they beat Pittsburgh in Game 7 to advance to the final. They got swept by Colorado, starting what would begin a 26-year wait between series victories.Other than the expansion Seattle Kraken, every other NHL franchise had won at least two series during that span. Detroit won 27, Pittsburgh 24, Tampa Bay 22 and Colorado won 20. Florida kept waiting and waiting for just one, until Friday.“These things, you’ve got to go through them a few times to really get the feel of it,” Brunette said. “You have to have heartbreaks. You have to have things that don’t go your way and you can find how hard it is and understand it and be resilient and when you see the reward like they saw tonight, it was all worth it.”NOTES: Lomberg played for the first time since Game 1, replacing Anthony Duclair in Florida’s lineup. Duclair was a healthy scratch after putting just one shot on net in the first five games. … Washington was without right wing Tom Wilson for a fifth consecutive game because of a lower-body injury.___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter athttps://twitter.com/SWhyno___More AP NHL:https://apnews.com/hub/NHLandhttps://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

You think you can be prepared for this when you know it’s coming, but you just can’t. The only person who’s comfort I want right now is the one who can’t give it to me. I miss him so much. I know where he is now is so much better, but it doesn’t change how much I miss him,” Lindsay Cappotelli wrote in a Facebook post.The WWE tweeted, “WWE is saddened to learn that Matt Cappotelli, a promising Superstar who was a co-winner of WWE Tough Enough III, passed away Friday at age 38.”An obituary posted on the WWE website said the former player for the Western Michigan University football team was the 2003 co-winner of WWE Tough Enough III with John Hennigan, who later changed his name to John Morrison.“My first best friend in the wrestling business and to this day one of the best people I’ve ever known Matt Cappotelli has passed on.

What kind of players do we need? What kind of football do we want to play?Liverpool like ’25 F1 cars’“The headline of everything was ‘how do we want to play?’ Underneath this headline in every transfer window, they created the team they have in both clubs.”Rangnick described Liverpool’s current squad as “25 Formula One racing cars” compared to the lethargy of the squad at his disposal, many of whom may have run their last races for the club.“The team needs a rebuild, not because some players have to go but because quite a few players’ contracts are expiring,” added Rangnick.“Therefore for me it’s clear that there will be six, seven, eight, maybe 10 new players, and before you sign those players, you need to know what kind of football does the new manager want to play.“Then bring every single player fitting into that profile.”Liverpool are the embodiment of that joined-up thinking.Seven years on from Klopp’s arrival at Anfield, they have never looked better.Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson, Virgil Van Dijk, Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Sadio Mane and Salah remain from the backbone of the team to have already been crowned English and European champions in recent years.January signing Luis Diaz, who opened the floodgates on Tuesday, has added even more firepower.And after an injury-disrupted first season in England, Thiago Alcantara is pulling the strings in midfield like he previously did for Barcelona and Bayern Munich in a glittering career."
752289309,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2011/05/27/The-NY-Times-Lied-About-Israeli-Reaction-to-Netanyahus-DC-Adventure,The NY Times Lied About Israeli Reaction to Netanyahu's D.C. Adventure,"Those who only read theNY Timeswould get the impression that last week’s trip to the United States by   Bibi Netanyahu was an absolute political disaster for the Israeli Prime Minister.The Progressive newspaper of record, the NewYork Timesheadline proclaimed:“Israelis See Netanyahu Trip as Diplomatic Failure.”“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel returned from Washington on  Wednesday to a nearly unanimous assessment among Israelis that despite  his forceful defense of Israel’s security interests, hopes were dashed  that his visit might advance peace negotiations with the Palestinians.”As my friend Dr. Barry Rubinexplains,Israelis have very little hope for peace because unlike the progressive media, they understand that the Palestinians because even though it  makes them unhappy they know thatthe Palestinians don’t want to advance  peace negotiations. But that theme–the Palestinian leadership doesn’t  want peace–is not permitted in virtually all of the American mass  media.Two new polls prove theNY Timesreport about Israeli reaction was totally biased.A poll conduced by the liberalIsraeli newspaper Ha’aretzwhich reported the positive Israeli reaction to Netanyahu’s trip.“Ha’aretz Poll: Netanyahu’s Popularity Soaring Following Washington Trip”“A new poll conducted by Dialog, under the supervision of Prof. Camil  Fuchs of the Tel Aviv University Statistics Department, showed that 47%  of the Israeli public believes Netanyahu’s U.S. trip was a success,  while only 10% viewed it as a failure.”In fact the poll seems to indicate the D.C. trip reversed Netanyahu’s decline in approval:While in a Haaretz poll five weeks ago Netanyahu seemed to be in hot water with the public, with 38 percent expressing satisfaction with his performance and 53 percent disappointed with it, in yesterday’s poll the results were essentially reversed: 51 percent were satisfied, while 36 percent were not.The moderateJerusalem Postconducted its own poll conducted afterObama’s Speech to AIPAC:When asked in the poll whether they saw Obama’s administration as more  pro-Israel, more pro-Palestinian or neutral, just 12 percent of Israeli Jews  surveyed said more pro-Israel, while 40% said more pro-Palestinian, 34% said  neutral and 13% did not express an opinion.Other polls taken after the Netanyahu trip agree withthe other two:A Telesker poll published in Ma’ariv on Wednesday found that the Likud had strengthened against Kadima. The poll predicted that the Likud would rise from 27 to 30 Knesset seats, while Kadima would fall from 28 to 27.Asked who was more fit to be prime minister, 36.9% said Netanyahu; 28.3% said Kadima leader Tzipi Livni; 9.2% said Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman of Israel Beiteinu; 2.6% said Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Independence; and 18.2% answered none of the above.A Sarid Institute poll broadcast on Channel 2 Tuesday night found that 38% of Israelis found Netanyahu most fit to be prime minister, and 35% Livni. The poll found that the Likud had grown in support at Kadima’s expense.Since the last poll taken by the institute during a crisis over gas prices, Kadima fell by five seats and Likud rose by four.The poll found that if an election were held now, Likud would win 34 seats (up seven from the last election in February 2009); and Kadima 29 (up one).A Geocartographic Institute poll broadcast on Channel 1 Tuesday night predicted that the Likud would win 33 seats, and Kadima 22. According to that survey, 61% of Jewish Israelis oppose Obama’s formula of the 1967 lines with land swaps as a basis for an agreement with the Palestinians, while only 27% favor it.If theNY Timeshad any interest in the truth it would have declared that Israelis saw the Netanyahu trip as a success, and as a result the Likud party grew in support. But the truth isn’t the story the progressive media wanted to convey.   TheTimes, like most progressives, wanted to brand the Netanyahu trip as an object failure for the  Israeli PM, because he committed what is to them, a felony, he had dared to “school” the precious infallible  President."
6936972252,https://www.breitbart.com/news/kavanaugh-hearing-runs-red-hot-with-partisan-anger/,Kavanaugh hearing runs red hot with partisan anger,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh devolved into a partisan fistfight Thursday as Democrats and Republicans — and Kavanaugh himself — sparred over explosive allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted an acquaintance while both were teenagers.Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called the hearing a “national disgrace,” while Texas Sen. John Cornyn said it was the most “embarrassing scandal for the U.S. Senate since the McCarthy hearings” in the 1950s.Fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Democrats’ treatment of Kavanaugh was the “most despicable thing” he has seen in politics.On the other side, Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called the hearing fundamentally “unfair” to Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when both were in high school. Kavanaugh denied the allegation. Republicans assigned a female prosecutor to question Ford on their behalf, even though “she’s not on trial,” Gillibrand said.Gillibrand and other Democrats were outraged that Republicans did not force a high school friend of Kavanaugh and other witnesses to testify under oath. Ford says Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge was present when the attack occurred.The charged atmosphere in the room was heightened by Kavanaugh himself, who delivered what has to rank among the most combative testimony ever heard in a congressional hearing room.As partisan as the nominating process has been, so too was the reaction.In Kavanaugh’s angry and tearful opening statement, supporters saw an expression of the frustration Republicans have felt since Kavanaugh was nominated by President Donald Trump in July.But Democrats said Kavanaugh’s 3 ½-hour appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee raised more questions than it answered.Kavanaugh’s testimony “had key gaps in substance and credibility,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and his frequent, angry outbursts “raised questions about his temperament.”Still, most GOP senators were likely to stick with Kavanaugh, especially without corroborating evidence from Ford to back up her story. Trump and Senate Republicans have resisted Democratic calls for an FBI investigation into Ford’s claims.While Ford’s testimony was compelling and her countenance likable — Hatch called her “attractive” and a good witness — her testimony did not appear to dramatically alter the political dynamic on his confirmation vote.The outcome largely sits where it has for weeks, on the shoulders of the few Republican senators who have not indicated how they will vote: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona. But other senators already in the “yes” column could change their minds.Republicans control the Senate 51-49. If all Democrats vote against Kavanaugh, they can lose only one vote and still confirm him, with Vice President Mike Pence expected to cast the decisive vote in the event of a tie.President Donald Trump made clear he was sticking with Kavanaugh, tweeting immediately after the hearing that Kavanaugh’s testimony was “powerful, honest and riveting.”He called Democrats’ “search and destroy strategy” disgraceful and said the process “has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct and resist.”Gillibrand, a longtime advocate for survivors of sexual violence, said the message Republicans were sending to sexual assault survivors — through the hearing and their support for Kavanaugh — was, “We don’t believe you, your voice doesn’t matter and we don’t value you.”Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, pressed Kavanaugh about his high school yearbook and the “drinking” and “sexual exploits” it mentions.After Kavanaugh talked about how he “busted his butt” on academics and played sports in high school, Leahy said: “We got a filibuster but not a single answer.” Leahy said after the hearing that Kavanaugh’s answers were “well-rehearsed.”Graham blamed Democrats for the hearing’s partisan nature, saying they sat on allegations against Kavanaugh for weeks and then sprung them on the nominee at the last minute in a desperate attempt to prevent his confirmation.Democrats’ tactics were “the most unethical sham,” Graham said in a fiery speech.Hatch said the hearing was “worse” than the 1991 hearing for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas — which Hatch also participated in and which led to a surge in the number of women elected to Congress the next year.“I didn’t think it could get any worse than that,” the veteran lawmaker told Kavanaugh. “This is a national disgrace, the way you’re being treated.”During her testimony, Ford, now 51, said of Kavanaugh, “I believed he was going to rape me.” Ford said she was “100 percent” certain a drunken Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, tried to remove her clothes and clapped a hand over her mouth as she tried to yell for help.Kavanaugh said he did not question that Ford was assaulted, but said, “I have never done this to her or to anyone.”Several women in the audience stood up when Ford finished testifying after more than four hours and said loudly, “Thank you, Dr. Ford!”“In the end there is likely to be as much doubt as certainty going out of this room today,” said Flake, one of the few undecided senators.He called for something rarely seen in the Senate: “humility.”____Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Mary Clare Jalonick and Juliet Linderman contributed to this story."

No biggie. This is how the left-wing media and the Republican Establishment have always colluded. What did stand out, though, was this whole Bethany Mandel thing.The Daily Beast opens its diatribe against Breitbart with Ms. Mandel’s personal story, which is not only wildly misleading, but where the evidence appears to provethe exact opposite.A good faith search found that Breitbart News has never attacked or criticized Bethany Mandel, a freelance, right-of-center contributor to sites like The Federalist.However, there are close to a dozen instances of her taunting and smearing Breitbart News and our staffers.The evidence is below. First, though, you must carefully read the Daily Beast’s story of a young woman who “has especially tangled with Breitbart News,” and the end result is her having to purchase a firearm and discuss her problems with local law enforcement.This is how the Daily Beast chose toopen its story:Conservative essayist Bethany S. Mandel, who has been awash in a deluge of social media abuse since she began denouncing Donald Trump, finally purchased a handgun over the weekend.“It’s a .22 magnum revolver,” says Mandel, the mother of two young children, who applied for a firearms permit at her local suburban police department after absorbing a fusillade of vile, anti-Semitic tweets and Facebook messages in recent months.“I’m picking it up,” Mandel says about her firearm, “after the shop’s background check comes back.”Having practiced at a New Jersey firing range, she prefers a revolver to a pistol because “my aim is far better,” she says.“My husband [New York Post Op-Ed page editor Seth Mandel] isn’t happy about it,” she says about her new acquisition.The 29-year-old Mandel, who writes for The Federalist, a conservative/libertarian web site that often inveighs against Trump, is a pugnacious online presence who frequently crosses swords with self-avowed acolytes of the Republican presidential frontrunner.She has especially tangled with Breitbart News, the rabble-rousing, Trump-friendly Web site—named for its late founder, culture warrior Andrew Breitbart—that regularly savages the GOP establishment, the media elite, the Washington consultant class, and the Fox News Channel, which it likes to portray as the willing enabler of all these sinister forces.“When I went to my local police department and applied for the gun permit, they said, ‘Maybe you should stop writing things that make people angry,’” Mandel recounts. “And I said, ‘OK, I’ll give that some consideration.’‘You have kids. Why would you do that?’‘Because I want to leave them a world that is worth living in.’”Here’s the thing, though — and this is important… Breitbart News does not appear to have ever written an unkind word about Bethany Mandel. In fact, all we could find werenice thingswe have written about Bethany Mandel.And here is where things get even more interesting.A good faith search of Twitter found that Bethany Mandel regularly, and without provocation, taunts Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle. In response to these taunts, Boyle has never responded in kind. Moreover, Mandel’s taunts provoke others on Twitter to taunt Boyle, which is what she is accusing Breitbart News of doing to her.Note that some of these taunts are from a week or two ago. Why this is important is detailed below.——Personally, I love to mix it up on Twitter. But a good faith search resulted in only pleasant Tweets from Mandel to me. Until Tuesday, I did not even follow Ms. Mandel on Twitter. The only tweet I could find from me to her was from yesterday, where I ask her to check her Direct Message. That was how I requested her comment on this article.——A search ofMandel’s Twitter handle and “Breitbart”shows that she regularly initiates criticism and smears against our site, which in turn results in more tweets attacking us.Again, many of these unprovoked taunts are from just a week or two ago, which is utterly baffling when she is claiming to the Daily Beast that “tangling” with us has resulted in abuse, and her fearing for her and her children’s safety.——Ms. Mandel appears to have a very friendly personal relationship withBreitbart’s Joel Pollak.There do not appear to be any tweets of any kind between Ms. Mandel andAlex Marlow,our editor-in-chief.As a result of these findings, I have personally, and without being accusatory, reached out to Ms. Mandel asking for any specifics she has to justify these very serious accusations against Breitbart News in the Daily Beast.So far she has chosen not to respond.Should she change her mind, I will update this piece immediately, and readily admit we missed something. All of my searches were in good faith, but it is a big Internet.Let me say again, though, that after a good faith search, we find no record of any kind of attacks or even criticism between Breitbart News, our staffers, and Ms. Mandel.Quite the opposite. All we found is that Ms. Mandel regularly and publicly taunts and attacks us.We have also reached out to the Daily Beast requesting their documentation or a full retraction. No one at Breitbart News interviewed by the Daily Beast recalls being asked about Bethany Mandel.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC"
8325963900,https://www.breitbart.com/news/north-korea-mocks-trump-hones-guam-strike-plans/,"North Korea mocks Trump, hones Guam strike plans","Seoul (AFP) – Nuclear-armed North Korea mocked President Donald Trump as “bereft of reason” Thursday, raising the stakes in their stand-off with an unusually detailed plan to send a salvo of missiles towards the US territory of Guam.The scheme to target the island, a key US military stronghold, was intended to “signal a crucial warning” as “only absolute force” would have an effect on the US leader, the North said.The declaration came after Trump boasted on Twitter that America’s nuclear arsenal was “far stronger and more powerful than ever before”.Earlier, Trump stunned the world with a bold-faced message to leader Kim Jong-Un that appeared to borrow from Pyongyang’s own rhetorical arsenal, saying the North faced “fire and fury like the world has never seen”.The war of words over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes is raising fears of a miscalculation that could lead to catastrophic consequences on the Korean peninsula and beyond.Last month the North carried out two successful tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile, bringing much of the US mainland within its range.Trump’s “fire and fury” remarks were “a load of nonsense”, said General Kim Rak-Gyom, the commander of the North’s missile forces, according to Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency.“Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason,” he added in a statement.The military would complete the Guam plan by mid-August and submit it to Kim Jong-Un for consideration, he said.The distinctively precise statement said the four missiles would be launched simultaneously and overfly the Japanese prefectures of Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi.They would have a flight time of 17 minutes 45 seconds, travel 3,356.7 kilometres (around 2,086 miles) and come down 30 to 40 kilometres away from Guam, it said — which would put the impact points just outside US territorial waters.Japan, which has in the past warned it would shoot down any North Korean missiles that threaten its territory, responded quickly to insist it can “never tolerate” provocations from the reclusive state.The western Pacific island of Guam is home to US strategic assets including long-range bombers and military jets and submarines, which are regularly deployed for shows of force in and near the Korean peninsula, to Pyongyang’s fury.Two supersonic US bombers took off from the island on a fly-over mission to Korea early this week.Professor Yang Moo-Jin of Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies said the level of detail in Pyongyang’s declaration was unusual.“The North appears to be saying what it is going to do is within international laws,” he told AFP. “Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the North may translate this plan into reality.”During the Cold War in the 1980s the Soviet Union sent unarmed missiles to come down in the Pacific within 1,000 kilometres of Hawaii.Analysts said a North Korean launch towards Guam would put the US in a dilemma: if it did not attempt to intercept the missiles, its credibility would be damaged and the North would feel emboldened to carry out a full-range ICBM test.But if an intercept was attempted and any of the rockets got through it would undermine the effectiveness of the United States’ ballistic missile defence.“This is a coercive threat to halt B-1 flights,” Adam Mount, senior fellow of the Center for American Progress said on Twitter.“Unlike Trump’s vague, incendiary threat, DPRK’s is coercive, clear, specific, and has credible escalation potential. Response is difficult.”Thousands of North Koreans marched through central Pyongyang Wednesday, waving clenched fists, as authorities put on a show of support for their stance.One banner proclaimed: “10 million hearts burn with vows to defend the fatherland until death.”Seoul’s military said the North would face “strong and resolute retaliation” in the event of an attack.– ‘Life and death’ –Tensions on the Korean peninsula tend to increase when Seoul and Washington launch major military joint exercises, and the next, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, is set to kick off around August 21.“Pyongyang’s interpretation of rhetoric from Washington is different from the way the West regards the North’s habitual threats. It views such fiery rhetoric from Trump as a matter of life and death,” said Hong Hyun-Ik, a senior researcher with the Sejong Institute.US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday warned the North to “stand down” in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, saying Pyongyang “should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people”.Amid reports that Trump’s comments had taken his inner circle by surprise, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the National Security Council and other officials knew the “president was going to respond… with a strong message in no uncertain terms”.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the Trump administration was all on “the same page”.But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he did not believe “there is any imminent threat” to Guam or other US targets, and expressed hope that diplomatic pressure would prevail in the crisis.The United Nations imposed a seventh set of sanctions on Pyongyang at the weekend that could cost North Korea $1 billion a year, with even the regime’s main ally China voting for the US-drafted proposal."
1029586422,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA3RFNT80,"White House calls NRA video repugnant, cowardly","(AP) White House calls NRA video repugnant, cowardlyWASHINGTONThe White House says a National Rifle Association video that makes reference to President Barack Obama’s daughters is “repugnant and cowardly.”Obama spokesman Jay Carney says most Americans agree that a president’s children should not be used as “pawns in a political fight.” Carney was referring to an online video from the pro-gun lobby that calls Obama an “elitist hypocrite” for having armed Secret Service agents protect his daughters at school while voicing skepticism about installing armed guards in all schools.The NRA released the video ahead of Obama’s announcement Wednesday of proposals for curbing the nation’s gun violence. The president is calling on Congress to enact universal background checks and ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines _ all measures the NRA opposes.The gun lobby has instead called for armed guards in schools.In a nod to calls for more school security, Obama said Wednesday that his administration would provide incentives for schools to hire more police officers as part of his overall package of anti-gun violence initiatives and proposals.In a related matter, NBC news criticized the NRA video for including an image of “Meet the Press” moderator David Gregory, who prompted an investigation by District of Columbia prosecutors after displaying a high-capacity ammunition magazine during an interview with NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre last month. Prosecutors decided not to file charges.“NBC News firmly objects to the use of our journalists in any political ad,” the network said in a statement. “David Gregory’s role as moderator of `Meet the Press’ is to ask tough questions of guests representing all sides of the issues.”"
1330639346,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/28/Fox-News-vs-the-Cult-of-Obama,Fox News vs. the Cult of Obama,"It is impossible to understand the Obama administration’s uniquely hostile treatment of Fox News without understanding the self-image of the Obama team. On the one hand, the targeting of Fox News for isolation and surveillance suggests an administration so lacking in competence that it cannot tolerate criticism or scrutiny. On the other, the attacks suggest hubris, a confidence that few would ever object to its conduct.That contradiction has a religious quality to it. Indeed, President Barack Obama has led an administration that has, at times, been more of a religious movement than a governing body. Obama has made miraculous promises of political and planetary transformation; he has encouraged a cult-like following, even among formerly skeptical journalists; and he has constructed a demonology of his opponents, real and imagined.Most of all, the Obama administration preaches a millenarian idea of history that places it at the apex of a process of moral evolution. In that view, the “long arc of history” that Obamacitedin his victory speech in 2008 does not just bend towards justice in a moral sense, but towards him in a political sense. He and his supporters see his election as both the culmination and transcendence of everything that came before him.Accordingly, Obama and his supporters refuse to be judged on normal criteria, such as the president’s actual record in office. Though he is quick to claim credit on the rare occasion–such as the bin Laden raid–when things go right, President Obama typically adopts a prophetic distance from the office he holds that insulates him from criticism and allows him to attack the very Washington he leads, the very political games he plays.The heresy of Fox News is not just that it criticizes the Obama administration or that it provides a platform for conservative opinion, but that it rejects the attempt to place Obama beyond politics and accountability. It refuses, in other words, to endorse the idea that Obama inhabits a unique category, beyond the obvious (and, for most governing purposes, meaningless) historic fact that he is the nation’s first black president.Democrats use race to defend Obama from criticism, but race is not what makes him special to the left. It is but one way in which he embodies an idea that existed long before him and will persist after he leaves office–namely, the Hegelian notion that the redistributionist state represents the fulfillment of history, that the noble intentions of the left make it morally superior, by default, regardless of their practical consequences.Obama not only shares his party’s belief in its moral superiority but also embodies it in his own person. His preference for the word “I” is but one symptom. In a recent, typical example, hetold the media: “I’ve still got 60,000-plus troops in Afghanistan,” as if those soldiers serve him personally and at his pleasure. The corollary: his critics must be motivated by personal hatred or bigotry, not any independent principles.That conviction, in the Obama inner circle, is what likely justified the hostile treatment of Fox News, which led to the abusive investigation of reporter James Rosen and others. Unlike the Nixon administration, which was suffused with paranoia, the Obama White House suffers from an excess of self-regard. It is threatened less by opposition than by independence–and by the idea that we must be students of, not servants of, history."

7665583367,https://www.breitbart.com/news/india-clampdown-hits-kashmirs-silicon-valley-2/,India clampdown hits Kashmir’s Silicon Valley,"Srinagar (India) (AFP) – The coffee machines have been cold, computer screens blank and work stations empty for two months in Kashmir’s Silicon Valley as an Indian communications blockade on the troubled region takes a growing toll on business.The dozen software development companies in the Rangreth industrial estate on the edge of Srinagar bring tens of millions of dollars of crucial revenue into the region each year.But the cutting of internet and mobile phone links on August 5, when the New Delhi government ended Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status, has crippled business.Rangreth has become a ghost town, a symbol of suffering across the region.The government said the crackdown, backed by the presence of hundreds of thousands of security forces, was needed to head off trouble by Pakistan-backed militants in the Muslim-majority territory.Pakistan also claims Kashmir which the two neighbours divided when they became independent in 1947 and have squabbled over ever since.Markets, banks, schools, clothes stores and the fledgling hi-tech industry have all been closed. Many locals say the shutdown is in protest at the government action. Authorities blame militant threats.Rangreth’s warehouse-style halls, normally packed with young T-shirted programmers, are empty.“It’s a devastating blow to the software business in Kashmir. Internet is like oxygen to our business and it has been taken away,” the owner of one company with clients all over the world told AFP on condition of anonymity.– No computers, no cars –The businessman said clients’ patience was running out. “We’re likely to lose them.”Jahangir Rasool, chief executive of internet provider STC, said he was detained by police for six days for keeping lines open for a few hours to help another company in his building that has clients in the United States.Rasool said his firm and others have the firewalls and protocols to block social media or “political propaganda” on the internet. But he said Indian authorities would not listen.“They sent police and intelligence agencies to inspect our systems. We told them that the IT sector will collapse (without the internet). They said: ‘Let it. We are not taking any risks’,” declared the director of another company with clients in the Middle East.Authorities have unblocked most landlines. But apart from 6,000 mobiles used by police and government officials, most of Kashmir’s 880,000 mobile connections and internet services remain suspended.State governor Satya Pal Malik in August said the lines were mainly useful as a “weapon” for “terrorists and Pakistanis for mobilisation and indoctrination”.Some IT companies have already laid off workers, many are preparing to move their business away from Kashmir.Rasool at STC said his company had lost more than $2.8 million in business since August 5 and has laid off two thirds of its 370 employees.“We can’t function in a total blackout,” said STC’s finance chief Abid Bhat who compared the shutdown to being “blind”.High-tech is not alone in its suffering.Not a single car or truck has been sold in two months by dealers across the Kashmir Valley, said Aawan Ahmad Narwaroo, head of one Srinagar car dealership.He reckoned about 5,000 vehicles and motorbikes were sold in the same two months last year.Official records show no new vehicles have been registered with the authorities since August 5.“It’s a collapse of Kashmir’s economy. It’s not possible to calculate the snowballing losses,” Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry vice president Nasir Hamid Khan told AFP.“About 1,200 trucks carrying Kashmiri produce used to ply daily on the main highway out. Today we hear not even 100 do,” Khan said.At least three top business leaders were among thousands arrested after the August 5 clampdown. The executives are still in detention.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a top police officer told AFP the decision to reopen mobile and internet services would be taken by India’s powerful Home Minister Amit Shah.“He (Shah) is asking for guarantees that no large scale protests will happen if the services are resumed. And there is no official here today confident enough to put his neck on the block,” the police official said."

The winning team of nearly 200 partners will at least match that amount.The private-public partnership will develop smart sensors to make all types of manufacturing more efficient, Obama said at a conference designed to showcase investment opportunities in the United States.The U.S. manufacturing sector has added over 800,000 jobs since February 2010. The industry has benefited greatly from lower natural gas prices. Obama said the creation of the manufacturing hub highlights how the United States is “running up the score” when it comes to the innovation edge companies enjoy when doing business there.“The world is smaller than it used to be because of innovation,” Obama said, adding: “that is something that can work for everyone if we do it right.”Administration officials said the manufacturing industry consumes about a third of the nation’s energy. Chemical production and steel manufacturing are examples of two industries with large energy costs that could benefit through new technological breakthroughs.“One should realize that the future’s manufacturing jobs are fundamentally IT jobs,” Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said.Obama said he recognized that people are concerned about how innovation and trade are leaving some people behind, but globalization also leads to opportunities for nations to learn from each other. He said “innovation spreading and connecting the globe promises prosperity and reductions in poverty and, ultimately, less likelihood of war and violence and conflict.”During a week focused on innovation, Obama will also attend a global entrepreneurship summit at Stanford University later this week. He is participating in a panel discussion with Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg."

That’s a start for us as a team. Now you can trust the system a little bit more and just focus on playing cricket.”An enthralling Test was still in the balance at lunchtime on the fourth day. After a tense morning when England could score only 50 runs in 25 overs for the loss of overnight batsmen Rory Burns (84) and Joe Denly (31), England were 205 runs short of their target of 376 but had their best batsmen, captain Joe Root and Ben Stokes at the crease.Immediately after lunch, with 14 overs to be bowled before the second new ball was due, Root and Stokes upped the tempo, adding 30 runs in five overs. Thirteen of those runs came from one over from left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj but Du Plessis persevered with the spinner.It was Maharaj who made the crucial breakthrough, bowling Stokes for 14 when the left-hander tried to play a cut shot against a ball which pitched in a rough area and deflected off his glove onto the stumps.“We had a lot of confidence in Kesh,” said Du Plessis.“We kept saying that we had a feeling that in the second innings he was going to get Ben Stokes out. He has got him out a few times and the way that Stokes plays he is going to take the game on. We had a gut feeling that it was going to happen. It was a massive wicket for us.”When the new ball was taken seven overs later the end came quickly as Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje blasted out the remaining batsmen.Rabada took four for 103 and Nortje three for 56.The game was effectively over when Du Plessis brought Nortje into the attack in place of Vernon Philander, who sent down three largely innocuous overs, and Nortje had Root caught behind for 48 with his second ball.Earlier Nortje dismissed Burns, also with the second ball of a spell, to make the first breakthrough of the day.– Tourists lack consistency –England captain Joe Root said the match was won and lost in the first innings “both with bat and ball.”He said South Africa escaped from a shaky 111 for five after being sent in, eventually making 284, largely through man of the match Quinton de Kock’s 95.“We could have been slightly more consistent,” he said. ““We gave them too many boundary balls. De Kock likes to score quite quickly and that allowed him to play in the manner he likes to bat.”That was followed by a poor batting performance which meant a first innings deficit of 103.“From that point on we fought very hard to get back into the game and we turned up today with a real that belief we could win the Test match,” said Root.“At lunch me and Ben looked at the scenario and it was pretty much the same equation as it was (against Australia) at Headingley not long ago.”Root said England needed to lift their game at the start of Test matches.“The thing that’s frustrating is that when we are behind the eight ball we show a lot of character, we show a lot of fight and determination and we find ways of getting ourselves back into fixtures. We need to do that at the start of games.”Root said he hoped the bout of illness which had affected 14 members of the squad had run its course.“Hopefully we can all be fighting fit and ready to go for Cape Town and bounce back very quickly.”The second Test starts at Newlands on Friday."
2243617725,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA5ATQS00,Risk and reward at the dawn of civilian drone age,"(AP) Risk and reward at the dawn of civilian drone ageBy JOAN LOWYAssociated PressWASHINGTONThe dawn of the age of aerial civilian drones is rich with possibilities for people far from the war zones where they made their devastating mark as a weapon of choice against terrorists.The unmanned, generally small aircraft can steer water and pesticides to crops with precision, saving farmers money while reducing environmental risk. They can inspect distant bridges, pipelines and power lines, and find hurricane victims stranded on rooftops.Drones _ some as tiny as a hummingbird _ promise everyday benefits as broad as the sky is wide. But the drone industry and those eager to tap its potential are running headlong into fears the peeping-eye, go-anywhere technology will be misused.Since January, drone-related legislation has been introduced in more than 30 states, largely in response to privacy concerns. Many of the bills would prevent police from using drones for broad public surveillance or to watch individuals without sufficient grounds to believe they were involved in crimes.Stephen Ingley, executive director of the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, says resistance to the technology is frustrating. Drones “clearly have so much potential for saving lives, and it’s a darn shame we’re having to go through this right now,” he said.But privacy advocates say now is the time to debate the proper use of civilian drones and set rules, before they become ubiquitous. Sentiment for curbing domestic drone use has brought the left and right together perhaps more than any other recent issue.“The thought of government drones buzzing overhead and constantly monitoring the activities of law-abiding citizens runs contrary to the notion of what it means to live in a free society,” Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said at a recent hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.With military budgets shrinking, drone makers have been counting on the civilian market to spur the industry’s growth. Some companies that make drones or supply support equipment and services say the uncertainty has caused them to put U.S. expansion plans on hold, and they are looking overseas for new markets.“Our lack of success in educating the public about unmanned aircraft is coming back to bite us,” said Robert Fitzgerald, CEO of the BOSH Group of Newport News, Va., which provides support services to drone users.“The U.S. has been at the lead of this technology a long time,” he said. “If our government holds back this technology, there’s the freedom to move elsewhere … and all of a sudden these things will be flying everywhere else and competing with us.”Law enforcement is expected to be one of the bigger initial markets for civilian drones. Last month, the FBI used drones to maintain continuous surveillance of a bunker in Alabama where a 5-year-old boy was being held hostage.In Virginia, the state General Assembly passed a bill that would place a two-year moratorium on the use of drones by state and local law enforcement. The measure is supported by groups as varied as the American Civil Liberties Union on the left and the Virginia Tea Party Patriots Federation on the right.Gov. Bob McDonnell is proposing amendments that would retain the broad ban on spy drones but allow specific exemptions when lives are in danger, such as for search-and rescue operations. The legislature reconvenes on April 3 to consider the matter.Seattle abandoned its drone program after community protests in February. The city’s police department had purchased two drones through a federal grant without consulting the city council.In Congress, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., co-chairman of the House’s privacy caucus, has introduced a bill that prohibits the Federal Aviation Administration from issuing drone licenses unless the applicant provides a statement explaining who will operate the drone, where it will be flown, what kind of data will be collected, how the data will be used, whether the information will be sold to third parties and the period for which the information will be retained.Privacy advocates acknowledge the many benign uses of drones. In Mesa County, Colo., for example, an annual landfill survey using manned aircraft cost about $10,000. The county recently performed the same survey using a drone for about $200.Drones can help police departments find missing people, reconstruct traffic accidents and act as lookouts for SWAT teams. Real estate agents can have them film videos of properties and surrounding neighborhoods, offering clients a better-than-bird’s-eye view though one that neighbors may not wish to have shared.“Any legislation that restricts the use of this kind of capability to serve the public is putting the public at risk,” said Steve Gitlin, vice president of AeroVironment, a leading maker of smaller drones.Yet the virtues of drones can also make them dangerous, privacy advocates say. The low cost and ease of use may encourage police and others to conduct the kind of continuous or intrusive surveillance that might otherwise be impractical.Drones can be equipped with high-powered cameras and listening devices, and infrared cameras that can see people in the dark.“High-rise buildings, security fences or even the walls of a building are not barriers to increasingly common drone technology,” Amie Stepanovich, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Council’s surveillance project, told the Senate panel.Civilian drone use is limited to government agencies and public universities that have received a few hundred permits from the FAA. A law passed by Congress last year requires the FAA to open U.S. skies to widespread drone flights by 2015, but the agency is behind schedule and it’s doubtful it will meet that deadline. Lawmakers and industry officials have complained for years about the FAA’s slow progress.The FAA estimates that within five years of gaining broader access about 7,500 civilian drones will be in use.Although the Supreme Court has not dealt directly with drones, it has OK’d aerial surveillance without warrants in drug cases in which officers in a plane or helicopter spotted marijuana plants growing on a suspect’s property.But in a case involving the use of ground-based equipment, the court said police generally need a warrant before using a thermal imaging device to detect hot spots in a home that might indicate that marijuana plants are being grown there.In some states economic concerns have trumped public unease. In Oklahoma, an anti-drone bill was shelved at the request of Republican Gov. Mary Fallin, who was concerned it might hinder growth of the state’s drone industry. The North Dakota state Senate killed a drone bill in part because it might impede the state’s chances of being selected by the Federal Aviation Administration as one of six national drone test sites, which could generate local jobs.A bill that would have limited the ability of state and local governments to use drones died in the Washington legislature. The measure was opposed by the Boeing Co., which employs more than 80,000 workers in the state and which has a subsidiary, Insitu, that’s a leading military drone manufacturer.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., recently drew attention to the domestic use of drones when he staged a Senate filibuster, demanding to know whether the president has authority to use weaponized drones to kill Americans on American soil. The White House said no, if the person isn’t engaged in combat. Industry officials worry that the episode could temporarily set back civilian drone use.“The opposition has become very loud,” said Gitlin of AeroVironment, “but we are confident that over time the benefits of these solutions are going to far outweigh the concerns, and they’ll become part of normal life in the future.”___Associated Press writer Michael Felberbaum in Richmond, Va., contributed to this report.___Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy"

Opposition parties have complained of a series of irregularities, particularly an electoral board decision to accept ballots without official stamps, as required by Turkish law.Yildirim said the “the path to seek rights” should be limited to legal objections and urged the opposition to accept the vote’s outcome.Thousands have protested in Istanbul and Ankara since Sunday’s referendum, which has set into motion the transformation of Turkey’s system of government from a parliamentary into a presidential one."

Jackson claims he does not care whether his vehement anti-President Donald Trump stance alienates some of his fans, pointing out that he has already made a significant fortune from their support.In aninterviewwithEsquirethis week,theCaptain Marvelstar accused supporters of the President Trump of complicity in “ruining the planet,” and urged them to “burn up” his films if they didn’t like it.“This motherfucker is like ruining the planet and all kinds of other crazy shit,” Samuel L. Jackson said. “And the people think that’s OK. It’s not fucking OK. And if you’re not saying anything, then you’re complicit.”“I know how many motherfuckers hate me. ‘I’m never going to see a Sam Jackson movie again.’ F–k I care?” he continued. “If you never went to another movie I did in my life, I’m not going to lose any money. I already cashed that check. F–k you. Burn up my videotapes. I don’t give a fuck.”ThePulp Fictionstar also hit back at critics who say that rather than weighing in on politics he should focus on his acting career.“No, motherfucker. I’m a human being that feels a certain way. And some of this shit does affect me, because if we don’t have health care … and my relatives get sick, they’re going to call my rich ass,” he explained. “I want them to have health care. I want them to be able to take care of themselves. This is how I feel. And I count to 100 some days before I hit ‘send,’ because I know how that shit is.”During the interview, Jackson alsoclaimedthat Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were the same kinds of people who racially abused him when he was young.“I’m angrier now about it than I was then just because I see these guys and I know these are the same guys: Trump and all those assholes, Mitch McConnell,” he said when asked about his childhood growing up in segregation. “But they’re the same fucking guys. And when I hear their voices, I hear the same voices.

We could see the doughnut hovering above the earth”The brothers said they launched from Askim, Norway, rather than Sweden to avoid the cost of flying permits.“In Sweden it would have cost 11,000 Swedish kroner [$1,245], but it was free in Norway,” Benjamin Jonsson told the Bohuslanningen newspaper.The brothers said volunteers with the Swedish Sea Rescue Society retrieved the camera, balloon and soggy doughnut from Lake Vattern after it made splashdown.There was no word on whether the soggy space doughnut was made into a meal."

Archbishop: Americans Must ‘Share Our Abundance’ with Illegal Aliens,"The archbishop of Washington, DC, Cardinal Wilton Gregory says Americans must welcome, protect, and share the United States with illegal aliens while urging Congress to pass amnesty.During a press conference this week, coordinated by the pro-mass migration group American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC), Gregoryurgedmembers of Congress to pass an amnesty for the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S.“Catholic social teaching upholds the principle that every person has the right to live in his or her own homeland in security and dignity,” Gregory said. “However, when loss of work forces migration, we must welcome them, protect them and share our abundance with them.”“Standing in solidarity with our migrant brothers and sisters means once again raising the question, will we care for our neighbor? After years of delay, the 117th Congress now has an opportunity to be courageous by addressing immigration in a comprehensive and productive way,” Gregory continued.Honduran migrants, part of a caravan heading to the United States, walk along a road in Camotan, Guatemala on January 16, 2021. (Photo by JOHAN ORDONEZ/AFP via Getty Images)The remarks come as senate Democrats areattemptingto slip an expansive amnesty for illegal aliens into a budget via the little-known filibuster-proof reconciliation process, which would only require 51 votes.This week, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said Democrats aregoingto “do the best that we can” in terms of slipping an amnesty through reconciliation.The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which avidly supports mass migration, is also lobbying Congress to pass an amnesty.“All Dreamers, not just those receiving DACA, deserve the opportunity to achieve their God-given potential in the only country most of them have ever known,” Bishop Mario E. Dorsonvillesaidin a statement this week. “This is not only a matter of human dignity but also family unity, considering the 250,000 U.S.-citizen children with Dreamers as parents.”“My brother bishops and I urge the Senate to join the House of Representatives in passing legislation that would provide legal status and a path to citizenship for all Dreamers,” Dorsonville continued.Already, current immigration levels put downward pressure on U.S. wages whileredistributingabout $500 billion in wealth away from America’s working and middle class and towards employers and new arrivals, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has found.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has repeatedlyfoundthat amnesty for illegal aliens would be a net fiscal drain for American taxpayers while driving down U.S. wages.Every year, 1.2 million legal immigrants receive green cards to permanently resettle in the U.S. In addition, 1.4 million foreign nationals are given visas to take American jobs while hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens enter the U.S. annually.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

He said, ‘Derek, it’s me. You don’t need to do this.'”Despite the kind words, though, Jim said that Derek said he wanted to finish the race.Derek added that his father kept trying to encourage him, but he kept thinking, “I can’t believe this is happening.”But as Jim helped his son, stadium security approached with their hands on the guns because they didn’t know what was happening. And Derek noted that he heard his father use some choice words toward the security officers.“It’s the only time I’ve ever heard my dad use bad language,” Derek said. He added, “I’m going to finish this race if it’s the last race I ever run.”“I’d rather be seen to be coming last in the semifinal than not finish in the semifinal,” Derek said, “because at least I can say I gave it my best.”It turned out it was just that. The injury kept Derek from competing at Olympic levels again. He tried to heal and race again, but he repeatedly re-injured his leg and was never able to regain his top status.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at:facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social@WarnerToddHuston"

The script from the story reads:Tonight, with the help of hidden camera footage, we’re going to show you how easy it seems to have become to conceal questionable funds from law enforcement and the public.You need look no further for evidence than the changing skyline of New York City, where much of the priciest residential real estate is being snapped up not by individuals, but byanonymous shell companies with secret owners.There’s nothing illegal about it as long as the money’s legitimate, but there’s no way to tell, if you don’t know who the real buyers are. It is one of the reasonsGlobal Witness, a London-based nonprofit organization that exposes international corruption, came to New York City 19 months ago. It wanted to see how helpful U.S. lawyers would be in concealing questionable funds.Other examples – asIndependent Journalobserves– include Horace Greeley’sNew York Tribune-sponsored undercover reporter Mortimer Thomson, who posed as a slave-buyer to expose the evils of slavery; Elizabeth Jane Cochran who – using the pseudonym Nellie Bly – infiltrated Blackwell’s Island to expose conditions for the mentally ill; and Pulitzer Prize winner Pam Zekman, who set up the fallacious Mirage Tavern in Chicago in order to expose how medical staff at various facilities were “performing abortions” on women who were not pregnant.Colb and Dorf explain that while the Supreme Court has affirmed the First Amendment right to unpopular speech – even if it is false – afederal appeals courthas rejected “a general First Amendment right of journalists to use deception to gain access to private property.” In sum, while freedom of the press exists under the Constitution, journalists and investigators can still be “stifled.”“The Planned Parenthood case reveals that activists — and journalists — might also have to go to prison for undercover reporting if they violate any laws to gain access to the targets of their investigation,” Colb and Dorf continue. “Consequently, the public fails to learn about some important matters.”The authors make their case:We need journalists and activists to investigate. With the Supreme Court seemingly unwilling to protect undercover investigators against general criminal laws, the job of protecting free speech would appear to fall to legislators and state court judges.Colb and Dorf acknowledge the terrain in this area is tricky, particularly in the age of social media when “anyone with a mobile phone can plausibly claim to be a citizen journalist.” However, they maintain that “the criminal prosecution of Daleiden and Merritt, even if they did break the law, could chill undercover journalists and activists everywhere.”"

According to Dempsey, there is no end game for America’s fight against the “radical, anti-Western religious ideology.”Dempsey said, “In terms of the open-endedness of it … the ideology that stretches from the Arab world and into North and West Africa, the ideology which is essentially anti-Western, very conservative, religious and in some cases racial violent ideology, were stuck with that for the foreseeable future, a generation or two.”Earlier in the week after ISIS had secured a section of Iraq and Syria roughly the size of Indiana the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself the “caliph” of the new Islamic state or “caliphate.” al-Baghdadi has previously threaten ISIS will attack America.Follow Pam Key On Twitter@pamkeyNEN"

There’s no doubt that we’re putting CO2 into the atmosphere. There’s no doubt that that increases temperatures and that affects the weather. And so, the ill effects, whether it’s, you know, farming in Texas being changed or wildfires or coral reefs dying off, there’s, you know, super hard evidence of the ocean rising. I do think it’s fair that people have different views on the tactics to deal with climate change. In fact, you know, having both parties thinking about that is going to be very important as we go forward.”He continued, “But this is a real challenge, and it’s great to see that particularly young Republicans are joining in and saying that this is something they care about, beyond their own individual success, morally preserving these ecosystems, allowing a livable planet — they care about that.”“But critics say, you know, it’s easy to talk about getting off fossil fuels, it’s easy to talk about going to a plant-based diet, but the reality is that hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs — that the coal miners in West Virginia or the livestock ranchers in Nebraska will be wiped out,” Wallace stated.“Well, it’s very important, as we solve this problem, that we not cause those community dislocations,” Gates replied. “You know, we have a 30-year transition period. The skill sets involved, whether it’s making clean hydrogen, sequestering CO2, the engineering skill sets, the things that those workers do, will be important. In fact, we’re going to have to almost triple the size of the electric grid and build all that transmission. And so, it’s not like there’s going to be a shortage of jobs overall — it’s just balancing to make sure that each community gets into the plan.”He added, “The CO2 stays in the atmosphere for thousands of years, and that’s what forces the temperatures to go up. And so, it’s really the sum of all those emissions starting in the industrial age that’s causing this temperature forcing with all of its ill effects. You know, there’s no magic date that it’s all great until then, and it’s terrible once you cross that threshold. It’s pretty linear as far as we know. 2050 happens to be the soonest realistic date for the world to change all of these source emissions — which are actually quite broader than most people are aware of because it’s got things like steel and cement, not just cars and electricity.”Follow Trent Baker on Twitter@MagnifiTrent"

Nor do the car companies need the president’s permission to move forward.Neither GM or Ford is building ventilators at present, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Friday that his company was “working on ventilators” but he didn’t specify how long it might take. His tweets also questioned the need and said it couldn’t be done immediately.Redirecting plants to make completely different products, in fact, will take a long time and a huge effort — possibly too long for some companies to help with medical gear shortages.“When you are repurposing a factory, it really depends on how similar the new product is to the existing products in your product line,” said Kaitlin Wowak, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on industrial supply chains. “It’s going to be a substantial pivot to start producing an entirely different item.”GM announced on Friday that it is working with ventilator maker Ventec Life Systems to ramp up production. The automaker said it would help with logistics, purchasing and manufacturing, but stopped short of saying it would make ventilators in its own factories, which have been idled for two weeks after workers who’d been fearful of the contagion put pressure on the company.Any manufacturing at GM would come much later, if ever. GM does have a lot of 3D printers and could make parts and other things to help, but it does not need permission from Trump. In fact, GM manufacturing engineers were at Ventec late last week working on this, well before Trump’s tweet.Ford, which also suspended factory production along with other automakers with operations in North America, confirmed that it too was in discussions with the Trump administration about helping, but had not started.“We’re looking at feasibility,” Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said. “It may be possible, but it’s not you go from Rangers (small pickups) one day to ventilators the next. We’re figuring out what is possible now.”Trump said last week that he invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, which allows the government to marshal the private sector to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. But he did not give examples as to how he was using it.On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, indicated that Trump had not used the act to trigger production of medical equipment.“What the president was saying is that these companies are coming forth on their own,” Fauci told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Peter Gaynor, agreed. “I think it’s an insurance policy. Right? It’s a lever. If we have to throw that lever we will,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”___Yen reported from Washington.___EDITOR’S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.___Find AP Fact Checks athttp://apne.ws/2kbx8bdFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter:https://twitter.com/APFactCheck"

Putin added that a thorough discussion is needed to address the issue.Putin said that some nations, including Austria, have offered to host his summit with Trump.Putin’s remarks follow a report that White House officials were working toward setting up a meeting. Trump has said he was open to having a summit with Putin, who U.S. intelligence officials have said directed Russian meddling in the 2016 election to help Trump win.The American leader has repeatedly said he wants to improve relationships with Moscow.Earlier Sunday, Putin criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal in a speech at the summit.He emphasized that the bloc’s members, who also include China, four ex-Soviet Central Asian nations, as well as India and Pakistan, are worried about the U.S. move.Putin said that Washington’s decision to exit the agreement could “destabilize the situation” in the region. He added that Moscow will continue to honor its obligations under the Iranian nuclear deal.Last month, Trump pulled out of former President Barack Obama’s landmark 2015 nuclear accord with Iran over the objections of European allies and other nations.Addressing the summit, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, whose country has an observer status in the group, said that Iran would expect other participants in the nuclear deal to provide guarantees that they would honor the agreement.Founded in 2001, the Beijing-based SCO has largely served as a vehicle for resolving border issues, fighting terrorism and — more implicitly — to counter American influence in Central Asia following its invasion of Afghanistan."

Brad Ashford in Tuesday’s primary election with a campaign that cast her as a champion of liberal ideals, including supporting a single-payer health care system.Eastman contrasted herself against Ashford, a centrist and former Republican who focused on his legislative experience and willingness to work with conservatives.She will now face Rep. Don Bacon, a first-term Republican who defeated Ashford in the 2016 election.Ashford had been the first Democrat in two decades to win the district, which encompasses much of the Omaha metro area. Although Omaha’s strong Democratic core is balanced out by more conservative suburbs, the district gives Democrats a fighting chance of capturing a congressional seat in a state that is otherwise overwhelmingly Republican.___12:55 a.m.Former state Rep. Paulette Jordan has won the Democratic primary for Idaho governor.She is the first woman to become the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Idaho.If she wins the general election, Jordan would not only be the first woman to serve as Idaho governor but also the first Native American woman to serve in that position in any state.The 38-year-old Jordan, who is a member of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, won Tuesday’s primary against 72-year-old Boise businessman A.J. Balukoff.The last Native American to hold a statewide office in Idaho was in 1990, when Larry Echo Hawk ran as a Democrat for attorney general.The open gubernatorial seat became a top political race when Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter announced he wouldn’t seek a fourth term.___12:30 a.m.Pennsylvania could send at least three women Congress next year, breaking the all-male hold on the state’s 18-member U.S. House delegation.Mary Gay Scanlon won a 10-way Democratic primary and Madeleine Dean won a three-way Democratic primary on Tuesday night for two suburban Philadelphia seats where Democrats are heavily favored in November.Meanwhile, Chrissy Houlahan is the uncontested Democratic nominee for another suburban Philadelphia seat where she’s heavily favored in November.Women won contested Democratic primaries in three other seats in Pennsylvania, although two of those seats are in solidly Republican districts and another is considered a toss-up in November.___12:25 a.m.The Nebraska Democratic primary race for the 2nd Congressional District between social worker Kara Eastman and former Rep. Brad Ashford appears too close to call and could be subject to a recount.Eastman appeared to hold a lead late Tuesday over Ashford, but neither candidate has claimed victory. The winner will face first-term Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who was unopposed in his primary.Bacon narrowly won the seat in 2016 from Ashford, who served one term in Congress.Ashford has presented himself as a centrist in the race, while Eastman has pitched herself as a liberal newcomer in hopes of energizing Democratic voters in the toss-up district.The district includes Omaha and several Republican-leaning suburbs.___12:20 a.m.Pennsylvania state Rep. Rick Saccone has lost a two-way Republican primary in a newly drawn congressional district in Pennsylvania, barely two months after losing to Democrat Conor Lamb in a special election for a different U.S. House seat.Saccone lost Tuesday’s 14th Congressional District primary election to state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler for the open seat in a heavily Republican district.Lamb beat Saccone in a district that President Donald Trump won in 2016 by about 20 percentage points. The president campaigned in the district twice and sent several tweets on Saccone’s behalf.___11:25 p.m.Oregon state Rep. Knute Buehler has won the GOP gubernatorial primary, besting a crowded field vying to compete against incumbent Democrat Kate Brown in November.Buehler, who ran for secretary of state in 2012, was the most centrist of the Republican front-runners.While skeptical of major new spending, Buehler says he is open to increased taxes on electronic and regular cigarettes to pay for budget items like health care, and also to a carbon tax.Buehler was considered a front-runner in Tuesday’s primary, along with retired Navy pilot Greg Wooldridge and businessman Sam Carpenter.___10:30 p.m.Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor has become the first holder of the office to lose in a primary election.John Fetterman won the five-way Democratic Party primary race for lieutenant governor Tuesday, beating incumbent Mike Stack.The Braddock mayor’s victory means he will run on a ticket with Gov. Tom Wolf in the fall. Pennsylvania first started allowing lieutenant governors to serve a second term in the 1970s.Fetterman had made a failed bid in 2016 for the U.S. Senate.Stack, a former Philadelphia state senator, has had a chilly relationship with Wolf in their first term together.Wolf last year ordered an investigation into the treatment of state employees by Stack and his wife and stripped Stack of state police protection.___10:05 p.m.Pennsylvania state senator and waste-hauling millionaire Scott Wagner is the winner of the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.Wagner’s victory in Tuesday’s three-way primary election caps a personal spending spree of more than $10 million that helped make him the front-runner and the GOP’s endorsed candidate.Wagner defeated first-time candidates Paul Mango and Laura Ellsworth, surviving weeks of Mango’s sharp-elbowed attack ads that painted Wagner as sleazy and greedy.Wagner fashions himself as a garbage man coming to clean up a state government that chokes the economy with regulations and taxes. He has compiled one of the Senate’s most conservative voting records.Wolf leads a unified Democratic Party into the fall. Wagner and Wolf live in York County.___10 p.m.Nebraska state Sen. Bob Krist of Omaha has won the Democratic nomination to run for the seat held by incumbent Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts.Krist defeated two other Democratic candidates in Tuesday’s primary election. The veteran state lawmaker campaigned on promises that he would take a less partisan approach to state government than Ricketts.Krist had been a Republican but switched his affiliation to nonpartisan in September when announcing his bid for governor. He reregistered as a Democrat in February because of legal barriers in his bid to qualify for the ballot as an independent.The two other Democrats who ran were Vanessa Ward, a pastor and community activist from Omaha, and Tyler Davis, a University of Nebraska at Omaha instructor.___9:50 p.m.Lincoln City Councilwoman and grocery store executive Jane Raybould has won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Nebraska.Raybould defeated three Democratic challengers in Tuesday’s primary race for the seat held by Republican Sen. Deb Fischer, who is running for re-election. Raybould faces an uphill general election battle in GOP-dominated Nebraska.Fischer won election in 2012 by nearly 16 percentage points.Raybould has served on the Lincoln City Council since 2015 and helps run her family’s grocery store chain. She ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2014 as part of Democrat Chuck Hassebrook’s gubernatorial campaign.The other Democratic hopefuls who ran were retired farmer, attorney and judge Frank Svoboda of Lincoln; retired Fremont real estate broker Larry Marvin; and Chris Janicek, the owner of an Omaha specialty cake business.___9:45 p.m.Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts has easily won the Republican nomination to seek a second term in November.Ricketts enters the general election with more than $1.3 million in campaign cash at his disposal for the general election, far outpacing all other gubernatorial candidates. His only GOP challenger in Tuesday’s primary didn’t raise or spend enough to trigger a reporting requirement.Ricketts defeated Krystal Gabel of Omaha, a technical writer who advocates for medical marijuana and industrial hemp. Gabel previously volunteered for the Nebraska Green Party and the Legal Cannabis Now Party.Ricketts has already started airing television ads to tout his previous efforts to lower property taxes.___9:40 p.m.A four-term congressman who is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump has won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania.U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta had paid little attention to his Republican rival, state Rep. Jim Christiana, during the primary campaign leading up to Tuesday. Instead, he focused his attacks on the candidate he is looking to unseat in the fall, two-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.Barletta is a former small-city mayor who first got national notice for attempting to pass local laws to combat illegal immigration.Barletta endorsed Trump for president. Trump asked Barletta to run for Senate and is expected to campaign for him.Casey is the son of a former Pennsylvania governor and is among 10 Democratic senators seeking re-election in states won by Trump.___9:30 p.m.Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska has won the Republican nomination in her bid for a second term in office.Fischer defeated four GOP challengers in Tuesday’s primary election and will be the strong favorite to win re-election in deep-red Nebraska.Some of Fischer’s primary opponents had argued she wasn’t conservative enough, but Fischer received endorsements from a majority of the state’s elected Republican officials, as well as major farm and business groups. Before being elected to the Senate, she was a rancher and state legislator.President Donald Trump had tweeted earlier Tuesday: “Nebraska – make sure you get out to the polls and VOTE for Deb Fischer today!”She defeated retired Omaha math professor Jack Heidel; writer and retired air conditioning technician Dennis Frank Macek; former finance manager Jeffrey Lynn Stein; and Lincoln businessman Todd Watson.___8:40 p.m.Polls have closed across Pennsylvania, one of four states holding primary elections Tuesday.In Pennsylvania, 84 candidates are vying for nominations in 18 U.S. House districts following the state’s court-ordered redrawing of congressional maps. The new districts are expected to give Democrats their best shot in years of picking up seats long held by Republicans.Republicans are also choosing their party’s challengers to Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and to U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, setting the stage for what is expected to be a hotly contested general election two years after Pennsylvania helped deliver the White House to Donald Trump.Idaho, Nebraska and Oregon are also holding primaries Tuesday.___12:10 a.m.A redrawn congressional map in Pennsylvania just three months ago has left candidates scrambling as four states prepare to hold primaries.In Pennsylvania, primary voters will decide the fate of President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. Senate. Idaho, Nebraska and Oregon are also holding primaries Tuesday.Congressman Raul Labrador is one of three GOP candidates for governor in Idaho, a state so heavily Republican that the primary goes a long way to determining the general election.Ten Republicans are vying for Oregon’s gubernatorial nomination — the most in more than a century. The interest among candidates belies the uphill climb for the party in the Democratic-leaning state.In Nebraska, Omaha-area Democrats will have options for the first time in the state’s lone urban House district, where two liberals are running."
3561956155,http://www.breitbart.com/news/russia-ukraine-reach-gas-deal-to-avoid-cuts-this-month/,"Russia, Ukraine reach gas deal to avoid cuts this month","BRUSSELS (AP) — Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement late Monday to ensure natural gas supplies to war-torn Ukraine for the month of March, averting possible cuts that could have hit supplies to the European Union.The two countries have fought several gas price wars in past years and Moscow had been threatening to turn off the taps to Ukraine on Tuesday unless it received outstanding pre-payments, as agreed in a deal they clinched last October, the so-called winter package.“I am satisfied that we managed to safeguard the full application of the winter package for the supply needs in Ukraine,” said EU energy chief Maros Sefcovic after mediating emergency talks between Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Demchyshyn.Demchyshyn said that both parties had agreed “to obey the rules” until the end of March.Under the deal sealed in Brussels, Ukraine’s Naftogaz will pre-pay and order sufficient quantities of gas to ensure all domestic consumption for March and guarantee undisrupted supplies to the EU. Gazprom commits to supply a set quantity of natural gas each day at agreed on delivery points.The European Union imports around 40 percent of its gas from Russia, half through Ukraine.Complicating the dispute has been deliveries to Ukraine’s rebel-held east, where fighting between Kiev’s forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed more than 6,000 people.Kiev cut gas supplies to rebel-held areas last week, prompting Russia to pump gas there directly. Russia said those deliveries should be counted in gas exports to Ukraine.Under the agreement, Kiev and Moscow acknowledged that the supply issue in eastern Ukraine “is highly complex in legal, technical and political terms”, and they agreed that more discussions would be required, a statement said.The EU’s executive Commission has asked the two to propose possible agenda points for further talks before the end of March aimed at agreeing a new gas arrangement for coming months."

The second and third were renewal applications since a FISA warrant must be renewed every 90 days.All three applications reportedly cited as key evidence against Page the dossier produced by the controversial Fusion GPS firm which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm.  The dossier was authored by ex-British spy Christopher Steele.According to Republican Housecharacterizations, the FISA applications signed by Comey withheld key information raising questions about the dossier, including that it was financed by Clinton and the DNC and had known credibility issues.Speaking at a CNN town hall event thatairedon Thursday night, Comey said the “bureau began an effort after we got the Steele dossier to try and see how much of it we could replicate. That work was ongoing when I was fired.”Yet aside from the general charge that Russia was seeking to interfere in the election, there were questions about the other dossier claims, he said, seemingly referring to the portions that sought to link Trump campaign officials to Russia.Comey stated:Some of it was consistent with our other intelligence, the most important part. The Steele dossier said the Russians are coming for the American election. It’s a huge effort. It has multiple goals that I laid out for the audience. And that was true.There were a lot of spokes off of that that we didn’t know whether they were true or false, and we were trying to figure out what we could make of it.Bruce Ohr, a career Justice Department official,admittedin testimony released in March that he informed the FBI that the anti-Trump dossier was tied to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.Ohr testified that he further warned his FBI superiors that the dossier information was likely “biased” against Trump and that he thought Steele was “desperate that Trump not be elected.”Ohr revealed that he spoke to the FBI about the role of Fusion GPS in producing the dossier, and informed the agency that his wife, Nellie Ohr, worked at the time for Fusion GPS.Critically, Ohr said that he transmitted all of that information in the time period before the FBI under James Comey certified the FISA application to obtain a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former adviser to President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Comey signed the first FISA application in late October 2016.Ohr’s testimony raises numerous immediate issues for the FBI and separately for Comey.Comey’s FISA application to conduct surveillance did not specifically state that the FBI had information that Steele was being paid in connection with any U.S. political party, according to House documents and the redacted FISA application itself.The application also did not say that the FBI was provided with any information that would raise issues of bias concerning Steele. Instead, Comey’s FISA application stated generally that “the FBI speculates” that Steele “was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit” Trump’s campaign — a far cry from informing the court that the dossier utilized as central evidence against Page in the FISA warrant was paid for by Trump’s primary political opponents, namely Clinton and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).The phraseology that the FBI “speculates” on possible bias is at odds with Ohr’s testimony that he directly told the FBI about several possible avenues of bias and that he had reason to believe Steele himself was biased.In other words, Comey may have kept from the FISA court information that would at a minimum raise major questions about the dossier charges that were cited as key evidence against Page in the FISA applications.The House Intelligence Committeememoreleased last February documented that Comey’s FISA applications did not disclose the information tying Clinton and the DNC to the dossier.“Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,” the memo states.Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released arebuttalof the House memo that confirms the key contention that the FBI and DOJ both failed to inform the FISA court that Steele’s dossier was funded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm.The Democratic memo quotes a footnote from the FISA application, which says that Steele:was approached by an identified U.S. person who indicated to Source #1 [Steele] that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1’s ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. person and Source #1 have a long-standing business relationship.) The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into candidate #1’s ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s campaign.That footnote, which does not inform the court of the dossier’s ties to the DNC, Clinton campaign or Fusion GPS, was further confirmed when the Trump administration released a redactedversionof the FISA applications last July.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Four years later in 2013, Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli raised$20.9 millionin a losing campaign in which his Democratic opponent outspent him by more than $13 million.Most of the fundraising dropoff between McDonnell in 2009 and Cuccinelli in 2013 can be traced to two dozen individuals, groups, and corporations who each donated more than $50,000 to McDonnell’s gubernatorial campaign and nothing to Cuccinelli’s. Between them, they accounted for $2.5 million of the $3.1 million by which Cuccinelli’s 2013 fundraising fell short of McDonnell’s in 2009.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was the most visible group that shunned Cuccinelli. In 2009 they donated$972,877to McDonnell. In 2013, they made no donation at all to Cuccinelli. On Thursday, Breitbart News asked Chamber Executive Director of Media Blair Latoff Holmes to explain why the Chamber failed to support Cuccinelli in 2013, but Ms. Holmes had not responded to our inquiry by the time of this story’s publication.R. Ted Weschler of Charlottesville, who donated$125,000to McDonnell in 2009, donated$50,000 to McAuliffein 2013. In 2011 Weschler, a successful money manager, washired by Warren Buffettto manage part of Berkshire-Hathaway’s portfolio.Paul Singer, a wealthy New York investor, donated $100,000 to McDonnell and $25,000 to Cuccinelli in 2009, but gave nothing to Cuccinelli in 2013.William A. Royall Jr. of Richmond gave McDonnell$95,000in 2009. In 2012 he gave Karl Rove’s American Crossroads$100,000. In 2013 he gave nothing to Cuccinelli.One surprising name on the list is the NFL’s Washington Redskins, whodonated $50,000to McDonnell in 2009 and nothing to Cuccinelli in 2013. On Thursday, Breitbart News left a message with the Redskins’ Vice President of Communications,Tony Wyllie, to ask for an explanation of the organization’s record of political donations in Virginia, but as of the time of this story’s publication had not received a response.Cuccinelli’s campaign apparently did little to court the Republican donors who stayed away. One veteran Virginia Republican fundraiser told Breitbart News that the fault was less the candidate’s than his campaign staff, whose style, the source said, was described by alienated high net worth donors as “arrogant.”The entire list of the two dozen biggest2009 McDonnell donorswho shunned Cuccinelli in 2013, included the following, according to the Virginia Public Access Project website:$972,877 –U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, DC$125,000 –R.

7138798696,https://www.breitbart.com/news/national-parks-dealing-with-vandals-human-waste-in-shutdown/,"National parks dealing with vandals, human waste in shutdown","WASHINGTON (AP) — Human feces, overflowing garbage, illegal off-roading and other damaging behavior in fragile areas were beginning to overwhelm some of the West’s iconic national parks on Monday, as a partial government shutdown left the areas open to visitors but with little staff on duty.“It’s a free-for-all,” Dakota Snider, 24, who lives and works in Yosemite Valley, said by telephone Monday, as Yosemite National Park officials announced closings of some minimally supervised campgrounds and public areas within the park that are overwhelmed.“It’s so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules then I’ve seen in my four years living here,” Snider said.The 10th day of the partial federal government shutdown, which has forced furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal government employees, has left many parks without most of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and otherwise keep parks running.Unlike shutdowns in some previous administrations, the Trump administration was leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs, said John Garder, senior budget director of the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association.“We’re afraid that we’re going to start seeing significant damage to the natural resources in parks and potentially to historic and other cultural artifacts,” Garder said. “We’re concerned there’ll be impacts to visitors’ safety.”“It’s really a nightmare scenario,” Garder said.Spokespeople with the Interior Department did not immediately return emails seeking comment on Monday.National Park Service spokesman Jeremy Barnum had said as the shutdown took hold that “national parks will remain as accessible as possible while still following all applicable laws and procedures.”In practice, that meant on Monday that many park toilets were closed or filled to overflowing, despite holiday crowds.Campers at Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California’s deserts were reporting squabbles as different families laid claims to sites, with no rangers on hand to adjudicate, said Ethan Feltges, who operates the Coyote Corner gift shop outside Joshua Tree.Feltges and other business owners around Joshua Tree had stepped into the gap as much as possible, hauling trailers into the park to empty overflowing trash bins and sweeping and stocking restrooms that were still open, Feltges said.Feltges himself had set up a portable toilet at his store to help the visitors still streaming in and out of the park. He was spending his days standing outside his store, offering tips about the park in place of the rangers who normally would be present.“The whole community has come together,” Feltges said, also by phone. “Everyone loves the park. And there’s a lot of businesses that actually need the park.”Some visitors have strung Christmas lights in the twisting Joshua trees, many of which are hundreds of years old, the Los Angeles Times reported.Most visitors were being respectful of the desert wilderness and park facilities, Joshua Tree’s superintendent, David Smith, said in a statement.But some are seizing on the shortage of park staffers to off-road illegally and otherwise damage the park, as well as relieving themselves in the open, a park statement said. Joshua Tree said it would begin closing some campgrounds for all but day use.At Yosemite, Snider, the local resident, said crowds of visitors were driving into the park to take advantage of free admission, with only a few park rangers working and a limited number of restrooms open.Visitors were allowing their dogs to run off-leash in an area rich with bears and other wildlife, and scattering bags of garbage along the roads, Snider said.“You’re looking at Yosemite Falls and in front of you is plastic bottles and trash bags,” he said."
6508733915,http://www.breitbart.com/news/less-is-more-as-companies-explore-shopping-by-voice/,Less is more as companies explore shopping by voice,"NEW YORK (AP) — When the world shifted from personal computers to smartphones, websites had to slim down to work on smaller screens and slower wireless connections. A similar shift to voice-centric services is again forcing businesses to rethink how they present information to consumers — and spurring new efforts to help them do so.The software company Adobe, for instance, announced on Tuesday a new suite of tools that could help airlines, retailers and other companies create simple voice interfaces for travel and shopping. It’s not a simple task, since a voice-based digital assistant can’t really list dozens of flight options or hundreds of products.That means companies have to figure out how to winnow down those choices to the travel options or products people are most likely to want — an inherently fraught undertaking.The technology is still in its infancy, and Adobe doesn’t have any actual corporate partners to showcase yet. But its announcement, made in conjunction with a tech show in Barcelona, Spain, shows that voice assistants are becoming important channels for reaching consumers.Amazon’s voice-shopping feature already boils down shopping requests to one or two options and makes buying easy because it already has payment and shipping information for voice-eligible customers. But smaller businesses don’t have the computing resources and expertise to match that, which is where companies like Adobe come in.Analyst Carolina Milanesi with Creative Strategies says she’s not aware of another service trying to help companies improve how they reach their customers through voice.In practice, making voice capabilities useful means anticipating what customers want. Travel sites, for instance, let people limit a search to, say, nonstop flights, but that’s more cumbersome when they’re talking to a service. Adobe promises to help narrow those options automatically, so that someone who earns points in United and likes early morning flights might hear only those matches.Adobe’s new voice service will work with all major voice assistants, not just Amazon’s. It will limit its analysis to data provided by the particular company people are shopping at, instead of trying to pulling together a more comprehensive personal profile from multiple sources.That will limit the accuracy of its personalization compared to what Adobe says it could provide. But the company believes consumers aren’t going to be comfortable with that broader profiling yet."
5982847840,http://www.breitbart.com/news/german-police-arrest-2-suspects-in-brazen-gold-coin-heist/,German police arrest 2 suspects in brazen gold coin heist,"BERLIN (AP) — German special police units raided several homes in Berlin early Wednesday in connection with the brazen heist of a 100-kilogram (221-pound) Canadian gold coin stolen from one of the city’s most famous museums earlier this year.Heavily-armed masked police arrested at least two suspects, one wearing a hood over his head, during early morning raids in the city’s Neukoelln neighborhood.“We assume that the two suspects match the ones seen on the video footage from surveillance cameras” during the burglary, police spokesman Winfrid Wenzel told The Associated Press.He said searches of the apartments were still continuing, but so far the coin hadn’t been found. Experts think the coin may have been melted down to cash in on the gold, Wenzel added.The Canadian “Big Maple Leaf” coin, worth several million euros (dollars), was stolen from the Bode museum in March.At least two burglars broke into the museum at night, using a ladder to climb to a window from elevated railway tracks. They grabbed the coin, loaded it onto a wheelbarrow and then carted it out of the building and along the tracks across the Spree river before descending into a park on a rope and fleeing in a getaway car.In July, police published still photos made from surveillance video asking the public for help in finding the thieves.Police say the three-centimeter (1.2-inch) thick coin, with a diameter of 53 centimeters (20.9 inches) has a face value of 1 million Canadian dollars ($750,000). By weight alone, however, it would be worth almost $4.5 million at market prices. The coin was likely damaged in the theft.The coin, which has an image of Queen Elizabeth II on one side, was on loan from a private, unidentified person, the German news agency dpa reported. There are maple leaves on the back of the coin. It’s one of only five that were made by the Royal Canadian Mint."
3572420403,http://www.breitbart.com/news/ringling-bros-says-circuses-to-be-elephant-free-in-3-years/,Ringling Bros. says circuses to be elephant-free in 3 years,"POLK CITY, Fla. (AP) — Animal rights activists were stunned when the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced it would eliminate elephants from its circus performances by 2018.“Monumental and long overdue,” was how the Animal Welfare Institute put it.“Startling and tremendously exciting,” The Humane Society of the United States said in a statement.And the International Fund for Animal Welfare called it “a giant step in the right direction.”But activists soon focused on the timing, questioning why it will take three years to phase out the elephants from the traveling circus shows.“Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis, so their retirement day needs to come now,” wrote Ingrid E. Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, in a statement. “If the decision is serious, then the circus needs to do it NOW.”Executives at Feld Entertainment, Ringling’s parent company, say it will take three years to build proper facilities for them on the 200-acre plot of land in central Florida that’s already being used as an elephant conservation center. They have repeatedly denied that the elephants are mistreated in any way in the circuses.“Each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area,” said Stephen Payne, Feld’s spokesman, adding that permits, drainage issues and other logistics must be worked out. The company intends for the elephants to live out their years on the property, and since one elephant is 69, they must plan for the long haul to care for the crop of gentle giants.The decision to phase out elephants from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus comes at a time when cities across the United States are cracking down on exotic animal displays.Even before Thursday’s announcement that the elephants will be phased out of Ringling’s performances by 2018, company officials already said they were pulling out of certain cities because of newly enacted restrictions.Feld executives said the decision to end the circus’s century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length. Elephants have often been featured on Ringling’s posters over the decades.“There’s been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers,” said Alana Feld, the company’s executive vice president. “A lot of people aren’t comfortable with us touring with our elephants.”Feld owns 43 elephants, 29 of which live at the company’s 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida. Thirteen animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018. One elephant is on a breeding loan to the Fort Worth Zoo.Another reason for the decision, company President Kenneth Feld said, was that certain cities and counties have passed “anti-circus” and “anti-elephant” ordinances. The company’s three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year, and Feld said it’s expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction. It’s also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations, he said.“All of the resources used to fight these things can be put toward the elephants,” Feld said during an interview at the conservation center. “We’re not reacting to our critics; we’re creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the Asian elephant.”Carol Bradley, the author of the book “Last Chain on Billie: How One Extraordinary Elephant Escaped the Big Top,” which is about a non-Ringling circus elephant, said she believes the Feld family “realized it was a losing PR battle.”“This is an enormous, earth-moving decision,” she said. “When I heard the news, my jaw hit the floor. I never thought they’d change their minds about this.”In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal-rights groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year legal battle over allegations that Ringling circus employees mistreated elephants.The initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former Ringling barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $190,000 by the animal-rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit. The judge called him “essentially a paid plaintiff” who lacked credibility and standing to sue. The judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial.Kenneth Feld testified during that trial about elephants’ importance to the show.“The symbol of the ‘Greatest Show on Earth’ is the elephant, and that’s what we’ve been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years.”When asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants, Feld replied, “No, it wouldn’t.”The circus will continue to use tigers, dogs and goats, and a Mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders joined its Circus Xtreme show this year. More motorsports, daredevils and feats of human physical capabilities will likely be showcased as well. In 2008, Feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties, including monster truck shows, motocross and the International Hot Rod Association, which promotes drag races and other events. In 2010, it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz. Roughly 30 million people attend one of Feld’s 5,000 live entertainment shows every year.Ringling’s popular Canada-based competitor, Cirque du Soleil, features human acts and doesn’t use wild animals.And while Ringling is phasing out the elephants, other, smaller circuses in the U.S. — and in countries such as Russia, France and Thailand — still use elephants.Feld owns the largest herd of Asian elephants in North America. It costs about $65,000 yearly to care for each elephant.Kenneth Feld said initially the conservation center will be open only to researchers, scientists and others studying the Asian elephant.He said he hopes it eventually expands “to something the public will be able to see.”____Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush."

I mean, it’s mostly bullshit right now.”And there you have it, a CNN producer, caught on camera, frankly admitting that “fake news” isn’t some regrettable accident of the 24-hour news cycle.“Fake news” is CNN’s entire business model. (The business model of quite a few other liberal MSM outlets too, if the tantalizing hints being dropped by James O’Keefe are to be believed…)As a fellow human being I feel sorry for the poor guycaught on camera by Project Veritasadmitting this stuff — because he’s probably going to lose his job.But as a fellow journalist I feel about as much sympathy for him as I do for all those idiot jihadists who go out to fight in Raqqa and Mosul, lured by the cool videos of the beards, black flags, and AKs with the wailing soundtrack. Did they seriously imagine when they joined ISIS/CNN that it was all just going to be about the glamour and the hot chicks and the purity of the noble cause?And I’m really not being high minded here. It just seems to me that one of the most basic, entry-level precepts that any serious news organization ought to be observe – and that CNN most patently never has observed, or not for a very, very long time – is this:Facts are sacred. The truth always makes the best story. Youdo notmake shit up.Not only ought this stuff to be obvious, but it ought to come instinctively. Isn’t the whole attraction of joining an unglamorous, overworked, underpaid trade like journalism that you want to discover the truth about the world: all the stuff thattheywould rather you didn’t know?That’s certainly been my own experience in the last few years covering the climate change/enviro-lunacy beat. I’ve never much enjoyed all the flak I’ve got from the left-wing media; still less have I liked being rejected by so many friends. But the thing that has kept me going through the hard times is that I know I’m doing good and making a real difference: there are some devious bastards out there doing terrible stuff and I’m exposing their knavery and holding them to account.For any self-respecting journalist, I’d call that “job done.”Sometimes I get asked by people on the other side of the argument: “What if you’re wrong?”Here’s the first thing I’ll do if I’m wrong about climate change. I’ll write a big piece explaining why I’m wrong. Then I’ll find someone who is prepared to pay me for writing the opposite of what I do now.This isn’t because I’m a moral paragon. It’s because I’m lazy and because I prefer the easier life: writing journalism where you have to keep making up your “facts” is much, much harder than doing what I do now, which is basically, copying out true facts and then adding a few nice adjectives and thinking up a snarky final sentence.That said, I would have to concede that this is much easier to do if you’re politically on the right rather than on the left.Margaret Thatcher once said “The facts of life are conservative.” And as in so many things, she was absolutely spot on. This, as you can imagine, makes life very, very difficult for people in the overcrowded left-wing media. (It’sovercrowdedbecause so many journalists think they’re left wing).Every day, they wake up to a world where: Israel is the only functioning democracy in the Middle East with the best human rights record; socialism is failing everywhere it is being tried from Venezuela to North Korea; the worst, most fascistic acts of violence and intolerance are being committed by left-wing people calling themselves “anti-fascists”; Islam is not a “religion of peace”; Trump is doing a great job as president — way, way better than his predecessor Obama; man-made climate change is the biggest scam in the history of science, politics, or economics…And somehow they’ve got to construct stories demonstrating the opposite because it’s what their dumb-assed audiences want to hear.How, if you’re running a left-wing media organization, do you reconcile this yawning gulf between the facts on the ground and your preferred political narrative?Simple: you remake the world so that black is white and white is black; you create your own facts.The liberal media has achieved this in myriad ways: selective reporting; emotive storytelling where opinion masquerades as news; targeting and vicious demonizing of anyone on the other side of the argument; the extensive quotation and celebration of people on the left who have successfully infiltrated schools, universities, branches of government, and other institutions both public and private, so that their skewed version of events becomes the official narrative.But perhaps the deadliest weapon in the liberal media’s armory is this: the continual pretence it makes that its news reporting is fair, balanced, and honest; that it is constantly striving after objective truth; that only its enemies in the malign right-wing press are guilty of biased journalism.And for years organizations like CNN — not to mention theNew York Times, theWashington Postand their various UK counterparts like theGuardianand the BBC — have been getting away with this because, as someone once said (maybe Churchill, maybe Lenin, maybe Mark Twain — no one is quite sure), “a lie is half way round the world before the truth has got his boots on.”One of the malign consequences of this deliberate and cynical lie (which comes straight out of the Leninist playbook) is that conservative media outlets have been continually forced onto the back foot, forever having to defend themselves against the charge that they serve up politicised news designed to advance their right wing agenda.Which they do, of course. Fox News does it. Breitbart does it. The Daily Caller does it. TheSunand theDaily Maildo it. Every one of them is undoubtedly guilty of serving up journalism with a right wing slant.The key element missing from this particular calumny is that the left wing media demonstrates at least as much bias, if not more. It just won’t admit it.I had a taste of this myself only a few months ago during a panel discussion in London at Chatham House which included senior editors from theNew York Timesand CNN. It was titled Media, Democracy and Political Influence: Does the Fourth Estate Still Matter?What amazed me that, while I was perfectly frank with the audience that Breitbart was a conservative media organization which catered for a largely conservative readership, both the guy from CNN and the guy fromNew York Timeswere adamant that they were objective seekers-after-truth. I had a similar experience at another media event which included a very unfriendly panellist — a lawyer who had worked for the Obama administration, who clearly thought very poorly of Breitbart.Perhaps they believed they were paragons of objective truth. But if they did, it was a truly absurd position to take, which hardly reflected well on their intellects.Name almost any issue: Israel/Palestine; government spending v low taxation; environmentalism v economic growth; what we should do in Syria; the genius of Donald Trump. On any one of them, there at least two and often several clearly very different positions you could take which would inevitably slant the way you covered them in a news story.The difference between right-wing outlets like Breitbart and left-wing ones like CNN is that we’re honest about what we do.And apart from making us more trustworthy, it also — a hostage to fortune, I know — makes us more bullet proof.I simply can’t imagine the left managing to pull off a hit job on Breitbart in the way that Project Veritas has pulled off against CNN, because we don’t have anything to hide.First, we’re extra, uber-careful about cleaving to the facts as closely as we can because we’re fully aware of how much grief we get from our left-wing opponents if we get stuff wrong.Second, we don’t need to make stuff up. You’re never going to get undercover recordings of me wondering how best to rig the facts in order to make climate change look like a massive global scam put together by shyster businesses, dodgy politicians, corrupt or stupid or greedy scientists and over zealous green activists, because I don’t need to do such things. The facts are on my side already. Which, given that I’m in the business of honest journalism, is just great."
7069522347,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/05/11/ca33-candidates-face-off-in-young-turks-internet-debate/,CA33 Candidates Face Off In Young Turks Internet Debate,"Most of the candidates vying for California’s 33rd Congressional District seat were on hand Saturday to endorse themselves, slam each other, and discuss policy in an unusually formatted Internet debate hosted by moderator Cenk Uygur and theYoung Turks, an online news show.Some candidates were notably absent from the debate; Democrats Wendy Greuel and Ted Lieu and Republican Lilli Gilani didn’t participate, and Uygur told the audience just before the debate began that Brent Roske, the Independent TV producer, had just dropped out and endorsed Marianne Williamson.Due to the sheer number of candidates debating, the Young Turks adopted an unorthodox strategy in their presentation: the debate was split into three hour-long segments, each featuring a different group of candidates. The first segment featured the Republican Kevin Mottus; Democrat Zein Obagi, Jr.; and the popular Independent Marianne Williamson. The second segment featured Democrats Kristie Holmes, David Kanuth, and Vince Flaherty; and Libertarian candidate Mark Matthew Herd. The last segment included Democrats Matt Miller and Barbara Mulvaney, Independent Tom Fox, Green Party candidate Michael Ian Sachs, and Republican Elan Carr.After brief opening statements, all three groups were asked the same five key questions, although the follow-ups in each segment were different. The five questions explored, in order, each candidate’s number one campaign priority; his or her opinion of Obama’s presidency thus far; their views on California’s transportation problems; their foreign policy ideas; and finally, each candidate’s position on campaign finance reform. Each candidate then had sixty seconds for a closing statement.The debate’s tone turned confrontational early in the first segment, when Williamson slammed several of Kevin Mottus’ transportation policy ideas as “naive”; Mottus, in turn, called Williamson naive for her proposal of a constitutional amendment aimed at reforming campaign finance law. Williamson, who said in her opening remarks that campaign finance reform is her first priority, asserted in the debate that a constitutional amendment would be the only way to significantly change campaign finance practice.Democrat Vince Flaherty also listed campaign finance reform as his top priority; for Carr and Kanuth it was education; for Fox, Miller, and Holmes it was the economy. Barbara Mulvaney said her top priority is the environment, while Obagi said providing immigrants with a pathway to success was tops on his list. Mottus said he is running on transportation issues and removing the dangers of radio-frequency radiation caused by mobile technology.In his opening statement, Miller took a swipe at Wendy Greuel and Ted Lieu: he said it was nice to participate in a forum where candidates have to answer tough questions, and questioned both candidates’ reasons for not appearing.Next came the candidates’ opinion of the President’s tenure; most candidates said there was a mix of good and bad in Obama’s presidency to this point, although Libertarian candidate Mark Matthew Herd said, “Are you kidding me? This guy’s gotta go and he can’t go any sooner. We gotta have a President that doesn’t lie about [the ACA].”Kristie Holmes said she was disappointed with the President’s lack of progress on immigration reform, saying Obama has deported more people than Bush did. “I want to see more humanity in the process,” she said.In his transportation questions, the moderator asked each candidate whether they supported the $68 billion high-speed rail currently being built in California. Most candidates indicated their support of the project, but almost all supporters noted they would have to revisit their support in light ofrecent reportsof rising costs. Carr, Kanuth, Holmes, and Herd all mentioned in some form that they do not support the project.On the question of Iran, almost all of the candidates had the same ideas; Uygur asked each candidate whether military options would be on the table if Iran refused to stop their uranium enrichment program. Each indicated that military options would necessarily be considered last, although Elan Carr stood tough on the question: “We must maintain a real, credible, threat of force to deter Iran.” Williamson said we “shouldn’t even have the idea of [military intervention] in our minds,” calling the Iranian people “our friends,” and noting that the President’s sanctions plan on Iran is plenty tough.During the questions on campaign finance reform, Mark Matthew Herd issued a challenge to the other candidates; he dared everyone in the race not to raise any more money for their campaigns. When Uygur followed up and asked the candidates whether they’d accept Herd’s challenge, Holmes and Flaherty explained they’re already running on very little money; Kanuth said the way to lessen money’s impact on politics is to have an engaged electorate, but ultimately turned down Herd’s challenge.Williamson and Obagi said early on that public financing of elections is necessary in the fight for campaign finance reform; Fox, Carr, Sachs, and a few others said transparency was the key to the election process. Mostly, the candidates with little campaign money slammed those with large money stashes, as the well-funded candidates tried to downplay their fundraising success.In the last segment, Uygur asked some of the candidates directly if they would legalize marijuana. Tom Fox and Barbara Mulvaney said yes; Miller said he would adopt a wait-and-see approach, looking for how Colorado and Washington handled their legalization of the drug; while Elan Carr adamantly rejected legalization, saying his experience as a prosecutor taught him that marijuana can “sap people of their ambition.”In their closing statements, many candidates mentioned their websites and asked for votes. Tom Fox noted this would be an important election, and made an appeal to millennials to get involved in the process. Miller hit Greuel and Lieu again before claiming he has the necessary qualifications to “shake up” the status quo in Washington, while Carr said that Washington has “descended into total dysfunction” and deserves solutions instead of hyper-partisanship. Obagi claimed to be the young successor Waxman would endorse, while Williamson reiterated the need for a pro-democracy movement in America. Herd spoke the only curse-word in the debate and provided a laugh when he said if voters don’t want the same old “bullshit” they should vote for him.The California primary will be held on June 3rd."

9317918796,https://www.breitbart.com/news/after-years-of-scrutiny-of-ny-detective-a-case-gets-retried/,"After years of scrutiny of NY detective, a case gets retried","Prosecutors in Brooklyn are for the first time retrying a long-ago case they won with the help of a former homicide detective whose work has been questionedAfter years of scrutiny of NY detective, a case gets retriedBy JENNIFER PELTZAssociated PressThe Associated PressNEW YORKNEW YORK (AP) — In the bloody years when killings peaked in New York City, Detective Louis Scarcella built a reputation for closing cases.A second-generation cop who smoked cigars, ran marathons, worked a side job at a Coney Island amusement park and jokingly put “adventurer” on his business card, the now-retired sleuth has been frank about lying to suspects, even praying with them, to elicit information. In the 1980s and ’90s, he got confession after confession. Prosecutors got conviction after conviction.But in the past nine years, nearly 20 murder and other convictions have been tossed out after defendants accused Scarcella of coercing or inducing false confessions and bogus witness identifications, whichhe denies. The same prosecutor’s office that won those convictions ended up repudiating most of them.Yet the Brooklyn district attorney has stood by many other cases the detective worked on. For the first time, prosecutors are now retrying one of those long-ago cases.“This defendant is still guilty,” prosecutor Chow Yun Xie said at the retrial of Eliseo DeLeon, who says he is innocent. DeLeon’s murder conviction was overturned in 2019 after he spent 24 years behind bars.With a verdict due Aug. 31, the retrial illustrates the tricky line the Brooklyn district attorney’s office has been walking through a decade of doubts about the work of a onetime star detective.Scarcella worked homicides as they soared to over 2,200 a year citywide in 1990. There were under 500 last year.After retiring in 1999, he told the “Dr. Phil” show that he’d done “whatever I have to do within the law” to get confessions or cooperation.“The bad guys don’t play by the rules when they kill Ma and Pop,” he said. “I don’t play by the rules, but I play within the moral rules and the rules of the arrest in Brooklyn.”Years later, the DA’s office becameknown for its Conviction Review Unit, which has scrutinized hundreds of cases and agreed to exonerate over 30 people after individual investigations. (Additionally, 90 drug convictionswere dropped en massebecause of police corruption allegations unrelated to Scarcella.)So far, 17 people in cases involving Scarcella have effectively been cleared when prosecutors disavowed convictions or declined retrials after judges overturned guilty verdicts.In two other cases — including DeLeon’s — convictions have been overturned, but prosecutors are fighting to restore them. Prosecutors have also concluded that convictions should stand in dozens of other Scarcella-related cases, though some defendants are trying to persuade courts otherwise.“In every case involving this former detective, CRU exhaustively reviewed all evidence, and the decision as to whether to vacate or uphold the conviction is based on the facts of the individual case, mindful of past findings regarding Scarcella’s conduct,” DA Eric Gonzalez’s office said in a statement to The Associated Press.Prosecutors say Scarcella and his partner played only a minor role in DeLeon’s case. And prosecutors emphasize that two eyewitnesses — the victim’s wife and a stranger — returned to court 27 years later to identify DeLeon anew as the killer of victim Fausto Cordero.“We were compelled to present that evidence” again, the DA’s office said.A would-be robber shot Cordero as he headed home from a 1995 religious confirmation party with his wife and other relatives, including the couple’s 7-year-old son. A tip led police to DeLeon, then 18. Detective Stephen Chmil was assigned to the case, and his partner, Scarcella, got involved.Just how involved is a key issue in the retrial.Case paperwork shows that Scarcella accompanied Chmil and co-lead Detective Anthony Baker to arrest DeLeon. As they took DeLeon to a police station, he said he was out of town when the shooting happened.At the stationhouse, Scarcella was on hand as DeLeon was read his rights, paperwork shows. But there’s dispute over whether the detective participated in an interrogation that, police and prosecutors say, produced a confession documented in a few brief sentences. DeLeon says detectives made it up.When Baker and some prosecutors later turned on a video camera, DeLeon asked for a lawyer to “make sure that my situation is right.”“I’m not going to just go and be a fool, put myself on tape and say I did something I didn’t do. I’m not stupid,” he said in the video, which jurors at his initial trial weren’t allowed to see.Scarcella testified last month that he didn’t remember the case but believes he wasn’t at the interrogation, though Baker said Scarcella was there but said nothing, and Chmil said his partner wasn’t the type to stay mum.DeLeon’s lawyers don’t buy that Scarcella was a bit player.“Everything in this case has been tainted” by Scarcella and Chmil, defense attorney Cary London said in a summation last month. He argued that the confession was fabricated and that the witness identifications were inaccurate and questionably obtained.Xie said that the case “withstood the test of time” and that the focus on Scarcella and Chmil was misplaced.The verdict is up to Judge Dena Douglas, who is hearing the case without a jury.Scarcella and Chmil, also retired, have now spent years defending their investigations as court hearings and news stories picked apart their cases. Their lawyers say that the investigators used techniques that are legal and endure today and that prosecutors signed off on every homicide arrest and vetted all the evidence.“The detectives worked diligently to apprehend the correct perpetrator and stand by their work,” attorneys Alan Abramson and Joel Cohen said in a statement to AP.At DeLeon’s retrial, Scarcella made clear he isn’t second-guessing himself.“You prided yourself on being a good homicide detective in the ’80s and ’90s?” London asked.“I still do,” Scarcella said."

So I am standing in front of you today to tell you, the British people that they are wrong. The doubters, the doomster, the gloomsters, they are going to get it wrong again.The people who bet against Britain again are going to lose their shirts, because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on the 31st of October, no ifs, no buts.”And we will do a new deal, a better deal, that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit… based on free trade and mutual support. I have every confidence that in 99 days we will have cracked it.Carrie Symonds (C), girlfriend of Britain’s new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, waits for the prime minister’s arrival with members of staff in Downing Street in London on July 24, 2019 on the day he was formally appointed British prime minister. TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty ImagesMr Johnson has previously vowed to take Britain out of the European Union “do or die” by October 31st — in 99 days time — but clearly prefers agreeing to a new deal if possible. While the European Union has repeatedly rejected this as a possibility, the new Prime Minister signalled his optimism, when he said:I say to our friends in Ireland, and Brussels, and around the EU. I am convinced we can do a deal. Without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop. It is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate, and we are forced to come out with no deal.Not because we want that outcome, of course not. But because it is only common sense to prepare. And let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted, and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready. At some point in the near future, to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control.[We will be] fully determined to take advantage, at last, of Brexit. Because that is the course this country is now set, with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready.In a clear message to Europe that he did not intend to hand over the so-called Brexit divorce payment to Brussels in a case of a no-deal departure, and would instead use the money to boost the economy upon Brexit, Boris said: “…and don’t forget, in a no-deal situation we will have that extra lubrication of the £39 billion pounds.”While Mr Johnson’s campaign to become Prime Minister focussed clearly on the issue of Brexit, he then moved onto his domestic agenda, promising improved delivery on health, education, and law and order.Mr Johnson was speaking shortly after meeting with the British monarch Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, where she formally invited him to form a government. Photographs released by the Palace showed Mr Johnson bowing his head to the Queen and shaking her hand as they met.The arrival of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister ends three years of Theresa May, a remain-supporting politician who promised to deliver Brexit. Yet despite making that promise repeatedly both in the chamber of the House of Commons and elsewhere, she ultimately failed, leading to her eventual departure from office Wednesday morning."
7052749062,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/12/07/liberals-praise-hillary-clintons-new-ad-sex-couples-kissing/,Liberals Praise Hillary Clinton’s New Ad With Same Sex Couples Kissing,"The Hillary Clinton campaign is out with an ad highlighting her record as an advocate for LGBT rights. The spot includes images of gay couples kissing each other.The liberal website Slate praises Clinton for including same-sex kissing in her campaign ad, saying, “Given the distressingly puritanical rules that govern gay PDAs, it’s both impressive and heartening that Clinton includes gay kisses in her official campaign spots.”“The ad forces viewers to confront images that might make them feel slightly uneasy, then encourages them to view such affection as a normal, healthy manifestation of adult intimacy.”The Slatewriter complains that, “it is a depressing but incontestable fact that most straight people—including many LGBT allies—are uncomfortable with the sight of same-sex kisses. Some straight people defend their disgust by pretending to be repulsed by all public kissing.”In the ad, Clinton says that she’s “running for president to stand up for the fundamental rights for LGBT Americans and all Americans.”However, Clinton has had a shaky record when it comes to same-sex marriage. In 2010 the State Department changed the passport application forms from “Mother” and “Father” to “Parent 1” and “Parent 2,” in order to accommodate and recognize same-sex parents.Emails released by the State Department show that then-Secretary of State Hillary was furious over the decision to give out gay-friendly passports. She sent an angry email to a staffer saying she wouldn’t defend the decision, “which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress.”It was alsoreportedthat in 2000, then-President Bill Clinton told historian Taylor Branch that Hillary experienced “discomfort” around “gay people who were king of acting out.” He told the historian that Hillary was, “a little put off by some of this stuff” and found gay rights “harder to swallow.”Clinton did not come out in favor of same-sex marriage until 2013."

Bannon, onBreitbart News Sundayand explained that he, lead author Lord Monckton, physicist Dr. Willie Soon, and David Legates, professor of Geography at the University of Delaware, developed a simple climate model that exposed the errors in the more complex computer models used by the IPCC. Thereportwas released in a joint article titled: “Why Models Run Hot: Results from An Irreducibly Simple Climate Model.”Dr. Briggs, who has a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics from Cornell, was assistant editor for theMonthly Weather Review, and is widely published on matters concerning climate. He explained that for decades “the computer climate models on which the IPCC and others rely, make forecasts where the temperature will be way up there. But, the reality is the temperature has been way down here. So these models are running hot!”The reason that the models are running hot is based on a “firm scientific principle,” says Briggs. “If a model is making bad predictions, which these climate models are, the theory that underlies them must be wrong. So these models must be wrong.”Briggs explained that atmospheric reaction to carbon dioxide, known as climate sensitivity, is probably too high for these models. “If you take this climate sensitivity model and tone it down, you get a much closer match to reality.” He contends that the computer models are overcompensating for the addition of CO2’s to the atmosphere.Although their findings weren’t that controversial scientifically, it was “unwelcome news” to the IPCC and other “Global Warmists”—“and that’s when the whole thing began to blow-up,” Briggs said.Chairman Bannon asked Briggs how he reacts to all the “smug” entertainers, celebrities, personalities, and others who assert that global warming is a settled science. Briggs responded by explaining that what is settled, “is the fundamental, unshakable scientific principle, that if you have a theory that makes bad predictions, that theory must be wrong. And we have had lousy predictions from these climate models for years and years and years. Something must be wrong. This is undeniable.”Briggs  elaborated that his paper has been downloaded 10,000 times, making it one of the most downloaded reports on climate change ever. But the statistician acknowledged that a lot of money and careers are on the line, largely relying on the premise that the planet is heating up.Consequently, he said, reporters from the aforementioned media outlets have done their best to smear the authors’ names. Moreover, they made attempts to get Soon and Legates fired from their jobs. Accusations were made that the authors wrote the paper for financial gains. Yet, no money was ever given or received for writing it. Briggs said the reporters “did not want to believe the truth I was telling them.”Greenpeace was able to access all of eminent solar physicist Willie Soon’s emails from his employer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center regarding the paper. But they found nothing suggesting any kind of foul play, deception or receiving of illegal funds.  Mr. Bannon mocked the Harvard-Smithsonian center for having released Soon’s correspondence, sarcastically referring to the institution as a “profiles in courage” for providing all of Soon’s private emails.Eventually, Greenpeace sent the emails to the media in a desperate attempt to unveil some sort of mistake in the study, or deception on the part of the authors. Bannon observed, “so they were trying to smear you, ruin your reputations?”  Briggs said that they tried, but every point was refuted entirely.Briggs emphasized that “if you don’t remember anything else from this radio program listen to this: If you have a theory and that theory makes bad predictions, that theory is in error….Climate forecasters have made, for decades, lousy predictions. They are therefore in error….People should not rely on them to make decisions. Certainly, they should not rely on them to make legislation.”"

7025839003,https://www.breitbart.com/news/one-of-our-islands-is-missing-japan-loses-a-bit-of-land-4/,One of our islands is missing: Japan ‘loses’ a bit of land,"Tokyo (AFP) – Missing: A tiny island in northern Japan. Or so authorities fear, prompting plans for a survey to determine if the outcrop has been washed away, ever-so-slightly shrinking the country’s territorial waters.The island, known as Esambe Hanakita Kojima was only officially surveyed and registered by Japan’s coastguard in 1987, who couldn’t even say exactly how big it was.Until recently, it rose 1.4-metre (four-and-a-half feet) above sea level, and was visible from the very northern tip of Japan’s northern Hokkaido island.But now, it has disappeared.“It is not impossible that tiny islands get weathered by the elements,” a coastguard official told AFP.The disappearance of the island “may affect Japan’s territorial waters a tiny bit,” she added, but only “if you conduct precision surveys”.Japan pours resources into protecting its outer islands, particularly the remote Okinotori islands in the Pacific, which secures a significant portion of the nation’s exclusive economic zone.It is also locked in disputes with neighbours, including China and South Korea, over the sovereignty of several islands in the region.Prone to earthquakes and severe weather, Japan has found itself not only losing, but sometimes gaining territory thanks to natural disasters and extreme weather.In 2015, a 300-metre strip of land emerged from the sea and attached itself to the coast of Hokkaido.Initially, the phenomenon raised fears of mysterious seismic activity, but geologists said it was probably the result of a landslide that pushed the underwater surface up.And in 2013, a volcanic island appeared around 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) south of Tokyo, engulfing an existing island and continuing to grow."

This is Texas’ first six-game slide at home since July 20-Aug. 3, 2005.“I didn’t sense any frustration,” Texas outfielder David Murphy said. “We’re past that point. Things didn’t happen. With the amount of talent we have here, we’re very close to turning this thing around.”Texas rookie Jurickson Profar started at third base for the first time in his career. All-Star Adrian Beltre had a scheduled day off in the field and was the designated hitter.Before the game, Profar spent time on the field working with infield coach Dave Anderson.Ian Kinsler batted third for the first time since May 22, 2011. He batted in that spot 60 times in 2010.The changes didn’t make a much of a difference as the Rangers finished the series 2 for 24 with runners in scoring position. They’ve scored only eight runs during their losing streak.Texas will complete its homestand with a four-game series starting Monday against the AL West-leading Oakland Athletics.“They’re leading the division,” Washington said. “If we’re ever going to get back on track, this is the series to get back on track with.”The last-place Blue Jays extended their winning streak to five games.In his second start with the Blue Jays, Wang (1-0) allowed seven hits in seven shutout innings to win for the first time since last June 12 with Washington. Toronto signed Wang last Tuesday to bolster a rotation with three starters on the disabled list.The 33-year-old Wang twice won 19 games for the New York Yankees before injuries derailed his career. He hurt his right foot in 2008 and injured his right shoulder in 2009.Wang was 4-4 with a 2.33 ERA in nine starts this year for the Yankees’ Triple-A team at Scranton-Wilkes-Barre. New York released him last week at his request and Wang signed with the Blue Jays.Colby Rasmus homered in his third straight game, and Adam Lind and J.P. Arencibia also chipped in with homers for Toronto. The Blue Jays outscored the Rangers 24-4 to sweep a four-game series at Texas for the first time.Derek Holland (5-4) allowed four runs and 10 hits in six innings for the Rangers.Elvis Andrus had an RBI single, and Kinsler walked with the bases loaded to break up the shutout in the ninth.“We’re struggling right now, but I still believe in them,” Washington said. “We’re going to move forward.”Arencibia, who entered the series in a 3-for-41 rut, hit his second homer in three games. He lined an 0-1 pitch just over the 14-foot fence in left, a two-run shot that gave the Blue Jays a 2-0 lead.It was the first home run Holland has given up since May 19.Rasmus led off the fourth with a drive off the foul pole in right for his 13th homer.The Blue Jays scored four times in the seventh to extend their lead to 7-0. Jose Bautista had an RBI single, and Lind capped it with a three-run homer off Kyle McClellan.Lind went 7 for 17 in the series with two home runs and six RBIs.NOTES: Texas DH Lance Berkman had a scheduled day off. .

6927317829,https://www.breitbart.com/news/ether-cryptocurrency-a-victim-of-blockchain-success/,"Ether cryptocurrency, a victim of blockchain success","London (AFP) – For all the attention afforded bitcoin, it is its rival ether that is hitting the headlines, with the popularity of its blockchain technology Ethereum driving concerns that have sent investors fleeing.Virtual currencies have struggled across the board this month after US investment banking giant Goldman Sachs pulled back from its plans to open a trading desk for bitcoin, damaging sentiment for the entire sector.Ether has slid 20 percent in value, taking a further hit from comments made by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, which powers the cryptocurrency.Earlier this month, the 24-year-old Russian-Canadian programmer told Bloomberg that “the (Ethereum) blockchain space is getting to the point where there’s a ceiling in sight”.A blockchain is essentially a ledger for recording transactions, which is both open to all who use it but extremely secure, and has enabled the rise of cryptocurrency trading.A multimillionaire thanks to Ethereum, Buterin has previously spoken about “scalability” probably being the number one challenge facing the sector.– Blockchain traffic jam –Unlike bitcoin’s blockchain, which carries out transactions involving only the cryptocurrency, Ethereum can host different virtual tokens and also enable certain digital applications and so-called smart contracts.Such programmes can for example automatically trigger payments without the use of a third party when pre-defined conditions are met, such as winning a sports bet.Ethereum is also home to two-thirds of initial coin offerings (ICOs), essentially a fundraising tool for companies which issue the tokens against cryptocurrencies much like issuing shares on a stock market.An explosion in the number of ICOs in 2017, two years after ether’s launch, resulted in the cryptocurrency’s price rocketing 160 times in value over a 12-month period.The craze surrounding ICOs has also caused congestion to Ethereum’s network, contributing to ether’s price collapse beginning in January.“The more it’s demanded, the more likely you are to clog the network,” said Jerome de Tychey, president of Asseth, an association promoting the use of Ethereum.A clogged Ethereum results in higher charges for clients wanting their transactions prioritised — and average fees briefly hit a record $5.50 in July according to bitinfocharts.com. Generally though, fees fluctuate around a few cents.Delays to a planned overhaul of Ethereum’s scalability have meanwhile likely discouraged some investors from using the blockchain, according to de Tychey.Naeem Aslam, an analyst at traders Think Markets, said Buterin “isn’t doing the job which he is supposed to do” — that is, to make companies “trust the technology and provide them (with) what they need”.– Virtual currency, real plunge –The plunge in the value of ether has indeed been dramatic. Since the start of August, it has lost more than half its value.Going back to May, the drop is 75 percent, with the total value of the virtual currency tumbling to about $23 billion from $82.5 billion.Yet the huge drop has only taken ether back to its value of a little over a year ago, at some $220 for one token.Another factor weighing on ether’s price has been the success of ICOs. The companies which raised funding in ether with ICOs now need to sell to them to cover operating expenses in fiat currencies.According to sector analysts Diar the companies that raised funding before the price boom at the end of last year have sold off some 20 percent of their ether holdings since April, weighing on its price."

Both sides also agreed to work jointly to find ways to drive down costs on the Norwegian continental shelf.Last week, Hodneland said union and industry leaders were negotiating with efficiency in mind. With crude oil prices holding at about 50 percent below 2014 levels, he said the goal was to improve competition in a way that preserved “as many jobs as possible.”Statistics Norway, the government’s record-keeping administration, said demand pressures on the petroleum industry started to wane at the end of 2013, which triggered the downturn in crude oil prices.As an exporter, the lower price for crude oil is taking a toll on the nation’s economy. Mainland gross domestic product for Norway increased by about 1 percent last year and the government said lower growth is expected this year.The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the nation’s energy regulator, said preliminary data indicate oil production averaged 1.55 million barrels per day. That’s a decline of more than 5 percent from April, but 2 percent higher than May 2015."
3552125562,http://www.breitbart.com/news/michigan-lawmakers-propose-bill-to-stop-asian-carp-invasion/,Michigan lawmakers propose bill to stop Asian carp invasion,"DETROIT, Feb. 26 (UPI) — On Thursday morning in Washington, D.C., Michigan lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced legislation intended to protect the Great Lakes from invasive Asian carp. The bill was simultaneously introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Congressman Candice Miller, R-Mich.The legislation isn’t so much a specific prescription for solving the problem as it as a mandate for federal agencies — like the EPA, Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers — to get to work immediately. While the bill wouldn’t allocate new funds, it would help clear bureaucratic hurdles and encourage federal officials to start working with state and regional entities to piece together a plan.The name of the game remains hydraulic separation, keeping water contaminated with Asian carp — a term used broadly to refer to species including grass, black, ugly, silver, and bighead carp — from water free flowing into the Great Lakes.That means locks and dams — both building new ones and bolstering old ones.“We cannot afford to take a cavalier approach when it comes to protecting our Great Lakes from Asian carp,” Miller said in a statement. “This destructive species is quickly migrating north, destroying nearly every ecosystem along the way.”“In fact, just this week, we learned that the Illinois Department of Natural Resources has identified nearly 30 of these aggressive fish just south of the Brandon Road Lock and Dam,” Miller added, “which is why this bipartisan, bicameral legislation I am working with Senator Stabenow to advance is so important.”The legislation asks the Army Corps to take the lead on the redoubled efforts, and to come up with a plan, cost estimate and project schedule, within six months of the bill’s passage.“These are fish that get very large and will be a very dangerous problem for us if they get into the Great Lakes,” Stabenow said. “Finding a solution to the threat from Asian carp and other invasive species is not easy.”Though many in the Midwest complain of the federal government’s delay in addressing the threat, the current protections have proved largely effective until this point. Despite their presence in much of the Mississippi River basin, only one Asian carp has ever been found beyond the protective barriers in Joliet, IL and Chicago, and the Great Lakes continue to test negative for Asian carp DNA.Still, a breach could be catastrophic for the lakes’ lucrative commercial fishing industry. Quickly proliferating Asian carp species can outcompete native fish, including yellow perch, walleye, lake trout and others. Economists estimate that the commercial and recreational fishing industries in the Great Lakes is worth a combined $7 billion."

He told the stories of three soldiers who had died. Each had been devoted to their mission and were praised by others for saving lives.Earlier in the morning, he and first lady Michelle Obama hosted a breakfast at the White House with “Gold Star” families of service members who have been killed.Another wreath-laying ceremony was planned at Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island in New York City. The park is a tribute to President Roosevelt’s famous speech calling for all people to enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined military leaders and others at the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument in Manhattan. He said celebrate the day and the good weather but also important to “remember the sacrifice that was made so that we could be here.”At the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, about 20 bicyclists clustered around World War II veteran and museum volunteer Tom Blakey, a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division who jumped at Normandy on D-Day _ June 6, 1944 _ and in May 1945 helped liberate the work camp at Wobbelin in northwest Germany.“Most of us wondered why we were there, killing people and being killed,” he said. “We didn’t do anything to deserve it. When we got to that camp and saw what was there, the lights came on.”The cycling group makes regular weekend training runs, and on Monday started a Memorial Day ride about seven miles away at the national cemetery in Chalmette, where the Battle of New Orleans _ the last in the War of 1812 _ was fought.“I’m glad I took this ride to hear a personal story,” Scott Gumina, 41, said. “Hearing one man’s account of his personal experience was pretty impressive to me.”Across much of New England, several days of heavy rain gave way to sunny skies for parades in towns large and small.In Portland, Maine, kids and even pets displayed the Stars and Stripes as veterans, youth groups law enforcement officials and civic organizations paraded to Monument Square to the tunes of a marching band, sirens from a police car and the rumble of motorcycles.“It’s a very important day, not only for the Veteran of Foreign Wars but every veteran organization, every branch of the service, and every patriot in general _ every American. This day is hugely significant and should never be forgotten,” said David Olson, 66, of Portland, the VFW’s state senior vice commander.He said he was pleased to see a large turnout of youngsters, both in the parade and along the parade route. “As they get older, they’ll realize exactly why we do this,” he said.For some veterans, it was a somber event.Richard Traiser, a Marine injured when his tank came under attack in Vietnam, helped deliver a three-volley salute with the Marine Corps League.Memorial Day gives those who served an opportunity to get together and remember friends who didn’t make it.“I think about them a lot, especially the people I lost in my platoon,” Traiser said. “A couple of kids were 19 years old. I don’t dwell on it in a morbid way, but it’s on your mind.”In Connecticut, a Waterford man who was killed in the Vietnam War was honored with a hometown park area named for him. Arnold E. Holm Jr., nicknamed “Dusty,” was killed when his helicopter was shot down on June 11, 1972. A group of at least 100 dedicated the park this weekend.In suburban Boston, veterans gathered in a park to mark Memorial Day this year rather than hold a parade because of failing health and dwindling numbers. The city of Beverly called off its parade because so few veterans would be able to march. The parade has been a fixture in the town since the Civil War.In Atlanta, a dedication of the History Center’s redone Veterans Park was scheduled for early evening. Soil from major battlefields will be scattered by veterans around the park’s flagpole.The holiday weekend also marked the traditional start of the U.S. vacation season. AAA, one of the nation’s largest leisure travel agencies, expected 31.2 million Americans to hit the road over the weekend, virtually the same number as last year. Gas prices were about the same as last year, up 1 cent to a national average of $3.65 a gallon Friday.__Associated Press writers David Sharp in Portland, Maine; Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans; and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report."

In doing so, though, the left-wing publication and Rich only revealed their own hideous racism:Conservative reaction to the unrest in Baltimore sometimes looks like a page out of the old “silent majority” playbook. The right has so far blamed the crisis on unions,welfare, single-parent families, Democrats, the “animalism” of Baltimore residents, and President Obama. Is there a political agenda taking root toexploit this crisisin 2016? …[W] we have the spectacle of Fox News commentators falling over themselves to repeat the name of one particular Baltimore gang, theBlack Guerrilla Family, over and over. (Such other Baltimore gang names as the Bloods and the Crips just don’t cut it anymore if you are in the scaring-whites business.) At the more serious level, we have a lead columnist in this morning’s New York Post all but wishing thatNew York might become “another Baltimore”so that blame can be placed on its Democratic mayor and the Democrats in general. …The ultimate goal of such conservative point-scoring in this tragedy may indeed be to drive a wedge between Hillary Clinton and those white Democratic and independent voters who defected from Obama but who might be inclined to vote for her. And those are white voters Clinton may need, after all, to make up any shortfall in enthusiasm and turnout among the young and minority voters who were so central to Obama’s two national victories. Will Clinton stand up — and stand up strongly — against such race-baiting?If I’m understanding Rich, and I think I am, properly identifying the name of a street gang, correctly describing animalistic behavior as “animalistic,” and correctly pointing out that a near-half century of unbridled Democrat rule — and with it the proven failure of left-wing policies (the welfare state, union cronyism, poor policing, ravaged schools) — is now racist.No one screamed “Ni**ger!”, no one claimed skin color has anything to do with anything, no one used the word “black” as a pejorative. The hard truth here is that the only people who truly give a damn about Baltimore are those Rich attacks as racist. We’re the only ones speaking the truth about what’s wrong with that failed city, and we do so knowing full well we will be publicly smeared as racists.Just like every elected Democrat and the rest of the mainstream media, what Frank Rich is really doing here is fighting for a failed status quo in Baltimore — fighting to quadruple down on the failed left-wing policies that for decades have created a genocidal cycle for young Baltimore black men.Although for decades, the left’s policies have proven devastating to predominantly black communities everywhere, Frank Rich smears those who say so because those policies also serve to keep Democrats in power through the fostering of government dependence.Frank Rich obviously believes that if the status quo keeps Democrats in power, the human cost in black lives is worth it.Which I think makes clear who the real racist is.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC"

Now we have just one match to play at the tournament and we will do our best to win it.”Ovechkin also praised Russia’s goalie Bobrovski for his outstanding performance at the event in general and in the last four clash in particular.“He (Bobrovsky) is without doubt more than a half of our team,” he said.“He’s one of the NHL’s top ‘keepers and I consider him to be the best player of this world championship. Regardless of our field players’ performance he always acts at his top boosting the team’s confidence a great deal.”Sochi Games runners-up Sweden got off to a flying start as their forward Oscar Moller put them 1-0 up when the match was just 19sec old, sending the puck in between Bobrovski’s pads from close range following Russia’s defensive blunder.Russia replied positively and began peppering Sweden’s goalie Anders Nilsson with shots to pull the scores level at 13:25 when their forward Sergei Plotnikov wristed in a rebound after the ‘keeper deflected Medvedev’s initial shot.Right winger Sergei Shirokov lifted Russia 2-1 up with two minutes remaining before the first intermission beating New York Islanders netminder Nilsson with a mid-range wrist shot after a piece of good individual work.SKA St Petersburg rear guard Anton Belov increased Russia’s lead with a powerful slap shot 11:02 into the second period.Sweden manager Par Marts substituted Nilsson for an extra attacker with 2:36 remaining in the third period while Russia’s Denis Denisov was sinbinned but Calgary Flames forward Mikael Backlund’s 5+20 min late penalty for charging dashed Sweden’s hopes of saving the day.“It’s a very frustrating defeat,” Detroit Red Wings forward Gustav Nyquist said.“We had some very good opportunities to come back in the second period.

Leni is honest.”In a televised address in the early hours of Tuesday, Robredo told supporters “nothing has been wasted. We did not fail.”She indicated that the movement would continue after the final results are announced, a process expected to take weeks.“We are just getting started,” she said.Judy Taguiwalo, 72, an anti-Marcos activist who was arrested twice and tortured during the elder Marcos’ regime said the election was “another crossroads” for the country.“We need to continue to stand up and struggle.”Analyst Mark Thompson said there should now be soul searching among an opposition that needs to broaden its message beyond “good governance”.“They need to make clear that they’re going to improve the lives of the average Filipino,” said Thompson, who is director of the Southeast Asia Research Centre at the City University of Hong Kong.Marcos was able to tap into widespread anger at a string of post-dictatorship governments, which many Filipinos believe had failed to materially improve their lives.Crucially, he also secured the support of several of the country’s powerful political dynasties, who through networks of patronage can be called on to deliver blocs of votes.Those alliances were set for a further victory with his running mate Sara Duterte garnering an even bigger lead over rivals in her vice presidential race.The certified results of both races are not expected for weeks.Dynastic burdenElection day began before dawn, as mask-clad voters formed long queues to cast their ballots in tens of thousands of polling stations across the archipelago.Polls officially closed 13 hours later at 7:00 pm (1100 GMT).At Mariano Marcos Memorial Elementary School in the northern city of Batac, the ancestral home of the Marcoses, voters waved hand fans to cool their faces in the tropical heat.Bomb sniffer dogs swept the polling station before Marcos Jr, 64, arrived with his younger sister Irene and eldest son Sandro.They were followed by the family’s flamboyant 92-year-old matriarch Imelda, who was lowered from a van dressed head to toe in red — the clan’s campaign colour.Sandro, 28, who is running for elected office for the first time in a congressional district in Ilocos Norte province, admitted the family’s history was “a burden”.But he added: “It’s one that we also try to sustain and protect and better as we serve.”Marcos Jr and Duterte — both offspring of authoritarian leaders — have insisted they are best qualified to “unify” the country.Hundreds of thousands of red-clad supporters turned out at Marcos Jr and Duterte’s raucous rally in Manila on Saturday, as they made a last push for votes.Josephine Llorca said successive governments since the 1986 revolution that ousted the family had failed to improve the lives of the poor.“We tried it and they were even worse than the Marcoses’ time,” she said.Other candidates seeking the presidency included boxing legend Manny Pacquiao and former street scavenger turned actor Francisco Domagoso.Personality rather than policy typically influences many people’s choice of candidate, though vote-buying and intimidation are also perennial problems.More than 60,000 security personnel were deployed to protect polling stations and election workers.Police reported at least two deadly shootings at polling stations on the restive southern island of Mindanao that had left four people dead and three wounded.That followed a grenade attack on Sunday that injured nine people."

He likes it this way. He likes the division. He likes the chaos. He’s been doing this since 2015. Well, longer, but on the national stage, he’s been doing this since 2015. People seem not to understand not only did he have the best medical treatment money could buy when he got COVID, but he got the vaccine as did everybody else in his family. It’s a travesty. This person should be held accountable for that as well, but we have a terrible time in this country holding powerful white men accountable for anything, even if it is the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans, and it’s something we really need to change.”When asked about her uncle’s support, Trump said, “I think that says a lot more about the Republican Party than it says about anything else. I don’t know. What I do know is that one thing Donald proved is that using racism as a platform was successful. I think that’s why we see so much strife in this country, and we need to continue having the kinds of conversations about race and gender that you have.”Calling out co-host Meghan McCain who did not participate her interview, Trump said, “This is an incredibly powerful platform, and I think the more we talk openly about these things. It’s a shame that your colleague didn’t have the courage to come on and have this conversation with me, but I appreciate that you were all willing to take up these very difficult subjects because racism, in my view, is at the heart of everything that’s wrong in 21st century America.”Follow Pam Key on Twitter@pamkeyNEN"

Kelly’s manager has been charged with making telephone threats of gunfire at a Manhattan theater to shut down a documentary about the singer’s alleged sexual abuse of women and girlsR. Kelly’s manager charged with phone threats to theaterBy LARRY NEUMEISTERAssociated PressThe Associated PressNEW YORKNEW YORK (AP) — R. Kelly’s manager has been arrested in California on charges that he threatened a shooting at a Manhattan theater two years ago, forcing an evacuation and the cancellation of the screening of a documentary addressing allegations that the singer had sexually abused women and girls.Donnell Russell, 45, of Chicago, was charged with conspiracy and with threatening physical harm by interstate communication.He appeared remotely Friday from Los Angeles before a magistrate judge in Manhattan. He was permitted to remain free on $75,000 bail. An email seeking comment was sent to his court-appointed lawyer.The chargecomes on the heels of Russell being chargedin Brooklyn federal court earlier this week with harassing a Kelly victim and her mother after the unidentified woman filed a lawsuit against Kelly. Authorities said Russell sent a letter to the woman’s lawyer with cropped nude photographs of her and later sent her a text warning her: “Pull the plug or you will be exposed.”In the latest case, authorities said the threats by Kelly’s manager and adviser in December 2018 forced the cancellation of the screening of Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly” series at the NeueHouse Madison Square as police took precautions, although they determined that there was no imminent threat.Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a release that a number of the Grammy award-winning R&B singer’s accusers were to attend the screening.“Threats of gun violence aimed at intimidating and silencing victims of sexual abuse are unlawful as well as unacceptable,” she said.William F. Sweeney Jr., head of New York’s FBI office, said it “defies logic that a threat like the one alleged here could stop victims from speaking about their alleged abuse.”Sweeney said Russell succeeded in shutting down one airing of the documentary but failed to silence the women featured in the film.“Each and every day, we do everything in our power to make sure victims of sexual abuse have the opportunity to be heard, and will continue to do so regardless of those who allegedly use violence as a means to stop them,” he said.Kelly remains jailed in Chicago after pleading not guilty to dozens of state and federal sex crime charges in Illinois, Minnesota and New York.The charges range from sexual assault to leading a racketeering scheme aimed at supplying Kelly with girls. Kelly also is accused of having unprotected sex with a minor in 2015 without disclosing he had herpes."

4625840308,http://www.breitbart.com/news/schuerrle-hits-hat-trick-as-wolfsburg-rout-hanover/,Schuerrle hits hat-trick as Wolfsburg rout Hanover,"Berlin (AFP) – Germany winger Andre Schuerrle claimed the first hat-trick of his career on Tuesday as Wolfsburg routed bottom side Hanover 96 4-0 away in the German league.It was Schuerrle’s cross at Rio de Janeiro’s Maracana which saw Mario Goetze score Germany’s winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final.But the 25-year-old Schuerrle has struggled to hold down a first-team place since joining Wolfsburg from Chelsea a year ago.However, he needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg’s fourth at Hanover’s HDI Arena.Schuerrle opened the scoring by firing home Draxler’s pass in off the post on 36 minutes.He doubled his tally on 59 minutes and then claimed his third less than three minutes later when he chested the ball down and fired home with a superb shot.It will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side.He could have finished with four goals after his chip went just wide of the post before Draxler netted Wolfsburg’s fourth on 69 minutes.The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom and six points from safety.The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after a flare fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt.In December 2014, Wolfsburg fans also fired four flares and set off a smoke bomb in the away section of Hanover’s stadium.Both clubs were fined 6,000 euros ($6,500) at the time.Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead.On Wednesday, German league leaders Bayern Munich host fifth-placed Mainz while Borussia Dortmund are at strugglers Darmstadt.Pep Guardiola’s Bayern will play Thomas Tuchel’s Borussia on Saturday in the mouth-watering top-of-the-table clash in Dortmund."

(We’re not talking about the 3-month bailout that wereported yesterday.We’re talking about the follow-on 120 billion euro bailout, to cover Greece’s debt payments through the end of 2013.)Exposure of various countries to a Greek debt default (Reuters)The S&P statement should hardly be a surprise to anyone.  As I’ve written in the past, the assumptions of the French Model are inherently contradictory.  The Europeans don’t want taxpayers to bear the entire cost of the bailout.  So they want investors to share in the bailout.  But they don’t want to force investors to share in the bailout, since that would force a default on Greece’s debt.  So they want the sharing to be “voluntary.”  But no investor would “voluntarily” lose money, so the whole idea is contradictory and impossible.A European financial analyst that I heard on al-Jazeera on Monday said that the Europeans are absolutely furious that the S&P is torpedoing the European plan.  “What right do Americans have to overrule the European government?” was being asked by unnamed European officials, along with unspecified threats against S&P.None of the analysts I heard on any channel claimed that the rating statement was wrong.  There was simply anger that S&P had told the truth.  Thus, the unspecified threats amount to extortion to force S&P to commit fraud.  Extortion and fraud are the norm today, especially in Europe.S&P has good reason to be honest about its rating of the French Model.  In the years up to 2007, Citibank, JP Morgan and other investment banks created and sold extremely complex CDOs and other synthetic securities that aremathematically provable as fraudulent.Nonetheless, S&P was bribed and extorted by the investment banks to give them AAA ratings, thus committing fraud.  Extortion and fraud have been the norm for a number of years now.But having committed fraud for so many years, and being blamed for a major part of the financial crisis, S&P now is not going to be too eager to commit fraud again, especially with the intense scrutiny going on today.One of the most widely respected European analysts is Wolfgang Münchau, associate editor of the Financial Times.  In aweekend column(Access), Münchau made a blistering attack on the French plan.He accuses the European politicians of purposely making the French plan as complex as possible — as complex as a CDO — in order “to obfuscate facts and circumvent rules.”  He summarizes the plan, and says:“If this was any other field of human activity, you would go to jail if you accepted, let alone made such an indecent offer. …All there is, is this dirty little con-trick. The complexity of the scheme is due to the need to persuade the rating agencies not to attach a default rating to Greek bonds.The rollover agreement represents, from an economic point of view, nothing but a collateralised bond. It subordinates all other bondholders. The rating agencies would normally not hesitate to attach a default rating to Greek government debt.So the solution is to create a complex structure, and claim that it is technically not a collateralised bond, but something that defies definition.Just why the Greeks would want to accept such a ruinous deal is not clear to me. …We have learnt from the financial crisis that one should not place too much faith in financial vehicles with three-letter acronyms. But that is what we are doing with this European equivalent of a late-period subprime mortgage CDO.We are not just “kicking” any old “can down the road” any more. This is a can of explosives.”Münchau wrote this column before the S&P downgrade, and as he suggested, “rating agencies [did] not hesitate to attach a default rating to Greek government debt.”Greek privatization delusionIn order to get its 3-month bailout on Sunday, Greece’s parliament had to approve harsh austerity measures, including the privatization of state-owned companies on a massive scale, requiring employees of these companies to lose their jobs or to take substantial pay cuts.Nobody believes that Greece will do this on their own, and so the EU is threatening to ‘massively limit’ Greece’s sovereignty, as wereported yesterday.The mechanism would be an external agency modeled on Germany’s ‘Treuhand agency’ that sold off 14,000 East German firms between 1990 and 1994.It is delusional to think that Greece’s public sector labor unions will tolerate this without a great deal of violence.  As one web site reader succinctly put it yesterday, “Greece will be happy to keep taking the money, but they have absolutely no desire (let alone ability) to pay any of it back. And if people think the Greeks are going to sit idly while Germany, the same people who invaded them during World War II, takes away their sovereignty from them, they’re delusional.”The stakes are very high in Europe, and no one cares about anyone but himself.  Fraud and extortion are the norm, and no one is safe.An immovable object meets an irresistible forceOn the one hand, you have the public sector labor unions, who are going to be asked to accept more and more job losses and salary cuts.On the other hand, you have the donor countries – Germany, Finland, Slovakia and the Netherlands – who are going to be asked to give more and more to the debtor countries.They’ll try to “kick the can down the road” as much as they can, but already they’re running out of options.One of the great questions of philosophy is: What happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object?  We may be about to find out."

But I’m happy that what I perceived as unfair tactics lost.”Many Sanders supporters felt that the Democratic National Committee treated them unfairly, especially afterDNC emails obtained by WikiLeaksshowed that the DNC worked against Bernie Sanders.“It’s far beyond perception at this point; it’s factual that the party leadership definitely put its hands on the scale for Secretary Clinton,” said Dallas Fowler, a Sanders delegate-turned-Clinton voter from Los Angeles. “And I think post-primary not dealing with that effectively as a party drove a number of people [away from Clinton].”Most Sanders supporters backed Clinton in the general election because the hope for many Democrats was that she would move further to the left after the convention.And she did, most notably with a college affordability plan that borrowed from Sanders’ plan.But some Sanders’ voters did not deem that sufficient.Sanders himself issued a statement about how Trump tapped into middle and working-class voters this election.“Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics, and the establishment media,” he said.Both progressives and more centrist Democrats agreed and areseeking a way forwardfor the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election."

The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 600 points. The tumult started last Friday as investors worried about signs of rising inflation.The market fell steadily as the day wore on and is on track for its fifth loss in the last six days. Technology companies, the leading sector over the past year, and banks fell the most.The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the benchmark for many index funds in 401(k) accounts, is now down 8.8 percent from the latest record high it set January 26. It’s still up 15 percent over the past year.Stock trading turned volatile over the last several days, breaking an unusually long period of calm. European markets were also lower after the Bank of England said it could raise interest rates in the coming months.After huge gains in the first weeks of this year, stocks tumbled Friday after the Labor Department said workers’ wages grew at a fast rate in January. That’s good for the economy, but investors worried it will hurt corporate profits and that rising wages are a sign of faster inflation. It could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace, which would act as a brake on the economy.The S&P 500 shed 58 points, or 2.2 percent, to 2,620 as of 1 p.m. Eastern time.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 633 points, or 2.5 percent, to 24,267. Boeing and Caterpillar took some of the worst losses. The Nasdaq composite fell 170 points, or 2.4 percent, to 6,884.The losses were broad. Four stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and 10 out of the 11 industry sectors in the S&P 500 index were down.Bond prices rose, sending yields slightly lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.82 percent from 2.84 percent.High-dividend stocks including phone companies fell. Those stocks are often seen as substitutes for bonds because they tend not to fluctuate that much in price and provide steady income. Those stocks fall out of favor when bond yields rise, as they have been for the past few months, and many expect the trend to continue. The yield on the 10-year note was as low as 2.04 percent as recently as September.The market didn’t get much help Thursday from company earnings reports, several of which disappointed investors. While U.S. companies mostly did well at the end of 2018, a number of them had a weak finish to the year.Hanesbrands, which makes underwear, T-shirts and socks, reported a smaller profit than investors expected, and its forecast for the current year didn’t live up to analysts’ estimates either. The company also said it will pay $400 million to buy Australian retailer Bras N Things. The stock dropped $2, or 9.1 percent, to $19.96.IRobot, which makes Roomba vacuums, plummeted 30 percent after projected a smaller annual profit than Wall Street was expecting. The stock dropped $27.21, or 30.9 percent, to $60.83.Twitter had a banner day, soaring 16 percent after turning in a profit for the first time. Its fourth-quarter revenue was also better than expected. The stock rose $4.49 to $31.40.Online delivery company GrubHub soared after it announced a partnership with Yum Brands, the parent of Taco Bell and KFC. GrubHub will provide the delivery people and technology to let people order food from those restaurants. GrubHub jumped $21.44, or 30.7 percent, to $91.34, while Yum Brands dipped $1.22, or 1.5 percent, to $78.91.After a sharp loss Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 76 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.03 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard for oil prices, gave up 77 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $64.74 per barrel in London.Stocks in Europe declined and bond yields increased after the Bank of England said could raise interest rates in coming months because of the strong global economy. That also sent the pound higher. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 1.5 percent and the French CAC 40 lost 2 percent. Germany’s DAX declined 2.6 percent.In Tokyo the Nikkei 225 index rose 1.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.5 percent and the Hang Seng of Hong Kong rose 0.4 percent.____AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jaytYoukyung Lee in Seoul and Kelvin Chan in Hong Kong contributed to this report."

Yet he could couldn’t offer any support for Sarah Palin when she was being accused of heinous crimes done by a nut case and not her.  That ok sarah palin will be keynote speaker at cpac this year. http://www.conservative.org/former-alaska-governor-sarah-palin-announced-as-cpac-2012-closing-speaker/13413/Finally we are cutting our forces down. What the fudgesicle is going on here. We got a angry Iran, North Korea is led by a bat poop crazy son we don’t know about. Also Terrorists attack our interest in Iraq and Israel. Now not the time to stand down and smoke the peace pipe we must be strong and show the world that America is ready to fight and protect our ally.

People’s houses were still standing.In fact, the entire country was breathing a sigh of relief. Unlike previous earthquakes that killed hundreds or thousands of people in Mexico, this one claimed no lives and left minimal destruction.Still, there is always the fear of aftershocks.So a group of residents of Santiago Jamiltepec, a town of 20,000 people in the mountains of Oaxaca state, set up camp in an open field for the night, fearing another quake could bring down their houses.That is where they were when the Mexican interior minister and Oaxaca governor arrived in a military helicopter to survey the disaster zone.The authorities are still investigating exactly what went wrong. But somehow, the pilot lost control of the UH-60 Black Hawk, keeled over and crashed about 40 meters (130 feet) to the ground.Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete and Governor Alejandro Murat were unharmed.But the helicopter plunged straight into the crowd on the ground, its rotor blades hacking people to bits.Fourteen people were killed, including a six-month-old baby and a 10-year-old girl. Another 15 were injured, some losing limbs.– ‘Hacked to pieces’ –Two days later, the town is still in shock at the tragedy. Blood stains are still visible on the ground where the mangled wreckage lies, cordoned off by the military.Clothing, chairs and toys still lie in the dirt around the wreckage.“Every time I go home I have to walk by here and see this,” said a shaken Concepcion Ramirez, 54.“It was horrific. We’ll never be able to forget it.”Leopoldo Garcia, who lives nearby, said the helicopter circled overhead several times.“It was flying very low. Suddenly it started swaying violently and fell like a rock, with the blades right over those poor people. And that’s when the screaming started,” he told AFP.“That’s when people saw it: one person cut in two, another with his insides hanging out, others beheaded by the blades,” said another resident, who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisals from the military.“People were hacked to pieces,” their horrified relatives left to try and pick up the severed body parts, he said in a trembling voice.– Unspeakable tragedy –The accident has been gut-wrenching for the military, too.“We came here to help people. That’s our job. But instead it just made things worse,” said an officer deployed to the zone.Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos flew in to meet with families of the victims.“I want to convey our condolences, on behalf of all Mexican soldiers,” he said.“The defense ministry completely assumes its responsibility for what happened.”But relatives were livid as they buried their dead this weekend.“No apology can fix this,” said Eduardo Morales after burying his cousin, 28-year-old Lauro Sanchez.“This accident left orphans and widows. Who’s going to take care of those kids whose feet were totally mangled?” he asked in outrage.Hundreds of residents took part in a large funeral procession on Saturday, carrying the colorful coffins to the local church amid sobs and screams.Forty-year-old Lorenzo Zarate’s mother, Maria Margarita Sanchez, was so shattered she could barely speak.“I can’t describe my sadness,” said the 63-year-old woman, burying her face in her scarf.Virginia Suarez, a family friend, clutched her rosary as a priest in a purple tunic presided over the service.“We’re all saying the same thing: how is it possible they died like this when all they wanted was to take shelter from the earthquake?” she said through a white veil."
5719238006,http://www.breitbart.com/news/new-york-giants-player-picked-for-random-drug-test-after-instagram-post/,New York Giants player picked for ‘random’ drug test after Instagram post,"April 12 (UPI) — A New York Giants linebacker said he was randomly selected for an NFL drug test after posting a photo with a cigar on Instagram.Two-time Super Bowl champion and seven-year NFL veteran Jonathan Casillas was vacationing in the Dominican Republic when he posted photos from the trip on social media. In one of the photos, he is sitting on an ATV while holding what he describes as a “hand-rolled Dominican cigar.”He also admitted to knowing it looked “like a blunt.”“Hand rolled Dominican cigar and ATV’s… great combination!! #iknowitlookslikeablun t #andIprobablyshouldnthavepostedthis #butthepicsolit #shoutouttotheshooter,” Casillas wrote.The next day, the linebacker posted a screenshot of a text message conversation from a representative of the league.“Jonathan: This is Joe…on behalf of the NFL,” the message read, according to Casillas’ Instagram. “You have been randomly selected for an off season test tomorrow. Please call me back as soon as possible to arrange a time.”Casillas poked fun at the timing, writing “Random lol, what a coincidence,” in the caption.“HAND ROLLED DOMINICAN CIGARS,” Casillas wrote in another Instagram post, featuring a photo of the cigars. “Mango flavored, and infused with vanilla, hands down the best I’ve had. Whenever I go on vacation I support the local vendors. I buy a shot glass, a keepsake for my daughter and a snow globe for her as well (I got the snow globe from the airport tho, duty free of course). The cigar station is one of the stops along the route of Macao ATV’s excursion. For those that think I’m foolish enough to post a blunt on social media clearly do not know what type of person I am or the caliber of role model I exemplify. It is very sad that after winning 2 Super Bowls, and playing 8 years pro while consistently doing things in communities especially with at risk kids, this is the most notoriety I have EVER received. Exactly what’s wrong with social media and the generation we now live in. Let’s see if @balleralert will repost this.”Casillas, 29, was the defensive captain last season for the Giants. In 16 games last season he registered 96 tackles and a forced fumble."
724992366,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2011/08/01/The-Debt-Ceiling-Deal--Doing-in-Defense,The Debt Ceiling Deal: Doing in Defense,"At this writing, many details of the debt  ceiling deal wrangled out over  the weekend remain fuzzy.   One thing is  clear, unfortunately:   The  national security of the United States is  going to suffer greatly.That will be so no matter how much is  taken out of the  defense budget as a result of the not-so-grand bargain  struck by  congressional leaders.   If approved by both houses, it would  reportedly  cut $350 billion from “security” spending as part of a  first tranche of  deficit-reduction.   Then, the Pentagon (and possibly  the Homeland  Security and State Department budgets) will be wacked by  as much as half  of the $1.5 trillion more that an as-yet undesignated  congressional  “super-committee” is supposed to come up with by  Thanksgiving.Put simply, these initiatives will treat national and homeland security as a bill-payer for deficit reduction.The  trouble is that – even if no further reductions were  made in the  spending allocated to defending our people and interests  around the  world – we will see ominous reductions in the capabilities  needed to  meet those vital responsibilities.   That will be because of  the more  than $400 billion already cut from our national security  investments  over the past few years.The warnings of what will befall our  military and country as  a result are beginning to accumulate.President  Obama’s first defense  secretary, Robert Gates, put down repeated  markers as he headed for the  door to the effect that we risked once  again “hollowing out” the armed  forces if anything like the sorts of  cuts Mr. Obama has proposed ($400  billion), let alone those called for  by others (up to $1 trillion), are  forthcoming.Senior military  officers, including the new chairman and  vice chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey and  Admiral James Winnefeld,  respectively, are making plain the  repercussions would be far-reaching.    Adm. Winnefeld told Congress at  hisconfirmation hearing:…As we  get to a higher and higher number [of  defense cuts], we’re going to  find that the strategies that we currently  have are going to reach  inflection points where we’re just going to  have to stop doing some of  the things that we currently are able to do  because what we can’t  afford is to have any kind of a cut result in a  hollow force.   We can’t  afford to have a cut result in irreversible  damage to our industrial  base.Last week, the Lexington Institute’s Daniel Goure observed  that these  officers were hardly alone:The Vice Chiefs [of Staff of  the four armed  services in congressional testimony] described a  military worn out by  continuous combat or allowed to age out as the  result of a defense  buildup that failed to adequately modernize the  force. Each of the  services has been plagued by readiness problems  that, in some cases,  have interfered with their ability to deploy  forces.Responsible legislators are expressing concern as well.    For  example, last week the chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee,  Rep. Howard “Buck” McKeon of California, declared that cuts  of the  magnitude now in prospect, “would have a disastrous impact on  our  military and we wouldn’t be able to carry out our missions.”Earlier  last month, the Senate’s Number 2 Republican,  Senator Jon Kyl of  Arizona, took to the floor of the Senate to challenge  a remark by  President Obama to the effect that we had to protect our  government’s  “core commitments” like food stamps at the expense of  national security  spending.   Sen. Kyl observed that there is no core  commitment that  supersedes the obligation to provide for the common  defense, the first  business of the federal government.Yet, President Obama,  congressional Democrats and at least a  few Republicans aredetermined to  make the sorts of reductions that will  prevent us from assuring the  common defense.   Some, particularly in  conservative circles, are doing  so out of a conviction that only a  strong economy can make possible a  strong military.Jamie Fly of the Foreign Policy Initiative  reminded us recently of a  remarkable statement byRonald Reagan in which  he addressed precisely  this point:In a December 1992 address to  students at the Oxford Union  Society, in a passage that is eerily  relevant to today’s debate, [the  former President declared]: ‘It is a  fashionable assertion in these  troubled times that nations must focus  on economic, not military  strength. Over the long run, it is true, no  nation can remain militarily  strong while economically exhausted. But I  would remind you that  defeats on the battlefield occur in the short  run. As the tragedies  ofBosnia, Somalia, and Sudan demonstrate all too  well, power still  matters. More precisely, economic power is not a  replacement for  military power.’History has taught us a painful  lesson that we are poised to learn all  over again.   Cutting “security  spending” in a dangerous world is an  invitation to enemies – actual and  prospective – to make it much more  dangerous for Americans and their  vital interests.   It invariably proves  to be a false economy, and the  costs are measured in lives as well as  immense amounts of dollars.We  literally cannot afford to make this mistake.   Those responsible will   surely be held accountable – later, if not sooner.   They may never be   forgiven, however."

7295088890,https://www.breitbart.com/news/apprentice-contestants-trump-defamation-suit-can-proceed/,‘Apprentice’ contestant’s Trump defamation suit can proceed,"NEW YORK (AP) — A former contestant on “The Apprentice” who accused President Donald Trump of unwanted kissing and groping can move forward with her defamation lawsuit against him, a state appeals court ruled Thursday, raising the prospect that a sitting president could be called for sworn questioning.A panel of judges on the Supreme Court Appellate Division said in their ruling, in a case brought by Summer Zervos, that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution doesn’t require trials in state court to be delayed until the president is out of office.Citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling two decades ago in a case involving alleged sexual misconduct by President Bill Clinton, a majority of judges on the panel said presidents can be sued in state courts over things they did that aren’t related to their official duties.“The current sitting President attempts to shield himself from consequences for his alleged unofficial misconduct by relying upon the constitutional protection of the Presidency,” the judges said in an opinion written by Justice Dianne T. Renwick. “We reject defendant President Trump’s argument that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution prevents a New York State court — and every other state court in the country — from exercising its authority under its state constitution. Instead, we find that the Supremacy Clause was never intended to deprive a state court of its authority to decide cases and controversies under the state’s constitution.”The decision, which increases the prospect that Trump could have to sit for sworn questioning in the lawsuit, was not unanimous.Two of the five justices on the panel, Peter Tom and Angela M. Mazzarelli, said in a dissent, written by Mazzarelli, that subjecting the president to a state trial court’s jurisdiction “interferes with his ability to carry out his constitutional duty of executing the laws of the United States.”Trump’s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said he planned to appeal to New York’s highest court.“We believe that the well-reasoned dissenting opinion by 2 of the 5 justices, citing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Clinton v. Jones case, is correct in concluding that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution bars state courts from hearing cases against the President while he or she is in office,” he wrote.Zervos was among over a dozen women who came forward during Trump’s 2016 campaign with allegations of sexual misconduct years earlier.He called the women “liars” trying to harm his campaign with “100 percent fabricated” stories, and he retweeted a message specifically calling Zervos’ claim “a hoax.” He also issued a statement denying it.Trump’s lawyers have said the case shouldn’t go forward while he is in office. They also say his remarks were opinions that he had a free-speech right to express in the course of a heated campaign.Zervos’ lawyers said Trump’s words were factual falsehoods that subjected her to threats and cost her business at her Southern California restaurant.Zervos appeared on “The Apprentice” in 2006, when Trump was the reality show’s host. She says he made the unwanted advances the next year during get-togethers she hoped would yield career advice.She says she didn’t go public with her allegations for almost a decade because she admired Trump as a businessman and thought he had had just a couple of episodes of bad behavior with her. Both Trump and Zervos are Republicans. Her resolve to stay quiet changed, she said, after an “Access Hollywood” recording emerged in October 2016 of Trump boasting about groping women.Zervos is seeking a retraction, an apology, and compensatory and punitive damages.Her lawyer, Mariann Wang, said in an emailed statements she was pleased the judges had ruled that Trump was “not above the law.”“We look forward to proving to a jury that Ms. Zervos told the truth about Defendant’s unwanted sexual groping and holding him accountable for his malicious lies,” she said.Both sides have continued gathering evidence while awaiting the appeals court’s decision. They face a June 28 deadline for any depositions — pretrial questioning under oath — of Trump and Zervos by each other’s lawyers."

They then put up a sign on the door saying the bank was closed,” Eddy Sid, a spokesman for the FO police union, told BFM television.“They then forced open some deposit boxes. Once that was done they left the employees in the bank and they were able to free themselves around lunchtime and call the police,” Sid added.Despite high security in the area, the men made an undetected getaway with their haul from Milleis.The value of the stolen items was not immediately known.“We saw nothing, heard nothing. It was when police arrived that we found out what was going on,” a nearby shopkeeper, who gave his name as Pierre, told AFP as investigators swarmed the area.– High-end heists –Luxury jewellers are regularly targeted by thieves in Paris, but gangs have also set their sights on super-rich visitors in recent years.In October 2016, five men tied up and robbed US reality television star Kim Kardashian of jewellery worth nine million euros whilst she was staying in a luxury residence hotel in the French capital.There have also been a string of attacks on vehicles heading to and from Le Bourget airport, which handles private jet departures from Paris.Among them, two Qatari women in a chauffeur-driven Bentley were robbed of jewels and other items worth more than five million euros ($5.7 million) in 2016.In January last year, some four million euros worth of jewels were stolen in a smash-and-grab raid at Paris’s Ritz hotel, on Place Vendome — a square celebrated for its jewellers — but police quickly arrested the robbers and recovered the jewels.Security around Place Vendome was reinforced in 2014 after five high-end jewellery and watch stores were hit by armed robberies in less than seven months. The losses in those attacks ranged from 420,000 euros to two million euros.In other attacks, a lone gunman attacked a bank near the Arc de Triomphe monument in February last year, but was shot and arrested by police.And in 2017, two men held up a luxury watch-makers just off the Champs-Elysees, getting away with items worth several hundred thousand euros."

He is accused of asking Doyen for as much as 1 million euros ($1.13m) to stop him publishing compromising documents on the internet.He faces up to 10 years in prison.His lawyers argue that Pinto is a “very important European whistleblower.”Staring in 2015, Pinto hacked millions of files in order, he said, to reveal the football industry’s “dishonesty”.In 2016, he shared four terabytes of data with a European media consortium which then published the Football Leaks, revealing tax evasion, possible fraud and corruption involving star players and big leaders.Pinto said when he was arrested in Budapest he had six more terabytes of unpublished document. According to the Portuguese press, the Hungarian authorities passed that data on to Portugal.“I was collaborating with the French authorities, starting a collaboration with Swiss authorities and probably to start another European collaboration, and suddenly Portugal sabotaged everything,” he said."

Bucky Hodges caught six passes for 145 yards and a touchdown and Cam Phillips added 109 yards receiving as Virginia Tech all but ended Pitt’s hopes of an ACC Coastal Division title.James Conner ran for 141 yards and three touchdowns for the Panthers. Nate Peterman completed 13 of 22 passes for 267 yards with a touchdown and an interception while also catching the first pass of his career as Pitt offensive coordinator Matt Canada went deep into his playbook once again. Pitt offensive tackle Brian O’Neill scored his second touchdown of the season, this time on a pitch from Peterman that resulted in the 6-foot-6, 300-pound O’Neill barreling over the goal line from 5 yards out.O’Neill’s unlikely score tied it at 29 with 13:25 remaining but the Hokies responded quickly. Slye hit his sixth field goal to put Virginia Tech back in front and following a Pitt punt Evans needed just three plays to take the Hokies 57 yards. Ford took care of the last 16, making a leaping grab to give Virginia Tech a 10-point cushion.Pitt scored once more to draw within three but the Hokies ran out the clock to assure they’ll end the weekend no worse than tied in the loss column with North Carolina atop the Coastal. Virginia Tech owns the tiebreaker, having beaten the Tar Heels decisively this month.THE TAKEAWAYVirginia Tech: The Hokies have the weapons to run the table. Pitt could do little against the 6-foot-7 Hodges and Evans often looked like a point guard lobbing alley-oop passes as he went up top to his receivers again and again. If Evans can avoid turning it over, the Hokies will be in the ACC title game.Pitt: Midway through Narduzzi’s second season, the defense remains a chaotic work in progress. Even the debut of ballyhooed freshman safety Damar Hamlin’s long anticipated debut did little to help. If Pitt’s pass defense was even average, the Panthers would be a threat to reach the ACC title game. It’s not, and the Panthers almost certainly won’t be in Orlando in December.UP NEXTVirginia Tech: Travel to Duke on Nov. 5. The Hokies fell to the Blue Devils 45-43 in four overtimes last season.Pitt: Begin a tough two-game stretch at Miami on Nov. 5. Hurricanes have won two of three meetings since Pitt joined ACC."

The Podesta Grouppaid a total of $180,000according to public records.As meticulously detailed in theNew York Timesbestselling bookClinton Cash,Uranium One is the firm that funneled millions to the Clinton Foundation as the Russian government gained ownership of the company.According to theNew York Times,Russian President Vladimir Putin had a “goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.”TheTimesreportedin last April:As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation.Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.TheTimesreport continued: “And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.”What’s more, according to theDaily Caller, Uranium One “paid the Podesta Group $40,000 to lobby the State Department, the Senate, the National Park Service and the National Security Council for ‘international mining projects,’ according to a July 20, 2012 filing.”From million dollar donations to the Clinton Foundation to hiring lobbying firms — namely The Podesta Group, co-founded by Clinton campaign chief John Podesta — by January 2013, Putin had met his goal and owned 20% of American uranium reserves.Again, if anyone loves Hillary Clinton, it’s the Russians and Vladimir Putin.FollowJerome Hudsonon Twitter:@jeromeehudson"

Ms May insisted that the remaining EU member states will do a deal with Britain, and that the deal will be in Britain’s best interest.Over the weekend the four Eastern EU member states which make up the Visigrad group (V4) – Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic – warned that they were willing to block all agreement with the UK unless the British government guaranteed the right for their citizens to live and work in the UK under current “freedom of movement” rules.Slovakia’s prime minister Robert Ficoinsisted: “V4 countries will be uncompromising. Unless we feel a guarantee that these people are equal, we will veto any agreement between the EU and Britain. I think Britain knows this is an issue for us where there’s no room for compromise.”On Monday he continued with this theme, announcing that the remaining European member states plan to make it “very difficult for the UK”, and insisted that Britain is “bluffing” when it says it can secure a good deal.But asked by reporters in whether the warnings from EU leaders were a sign that they may refuse to do a deal with the UK, May said: “The 27 will sign up to a deal with us,”The Telegraphhasreported.She added: “We will be negotiating with them and we will be ambitious in what we want to see for the United Kingdom.“It’s right for us to do that. But I think a good deal for the UK can also be a good deal for the other member states because I believe in good trading relations and I want the UK to be a global leader in free trade.”The Prime Minister continued: “I had very constructive meetings with [Mr Fico] when I was doing my visits earlier in the summer.“We’re going to be in a negotiation with the 27 members of the European Union about the relationship we will have with them when we leave the EU.“I’ve said what I want to see is the deal that’s right for the UK. I think that will also be a deal that’s good for the member states of the European Union.“This is not just about us – it’s actually about relationships and trading within that European arena. So we will go into these negotiations and we will be ambitious for the UK.”Mrs May is currently attending the UN’s General Assembly in New York, where she will today defend the Brexit vote, telling colleagues that the British people did not opt to leave the EU in order to “turn inwards or walk away”.She will also advise world leaders that the referendum result proves people want “a politics that is more in touch with their concerns”.Follow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter:Follow @Donna_R_Eor e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com"

A directive Cuomo made last March forced nursing homes to accept coronavirus-positive patients in order to free up hospital beds.“Now that would be bad enough, but since then, his administration has tried to downplay any consequences of that action, releasing a report last July that laid the blame on nursing home staffers for infecting residents, and, as a Cuomo aide recently told lawmakers, actively concealing data on COVID deaths out of fear it’d be used against them by federal prosecutors,” John Oliver added.Watch Later:Areportfrom New York’s attorney general says that nursing home deaths could have been under-reported by as much as 50 percent, amounting to thousands of deaths.“And Cuomo is famously unpleasant,” said Oliver. “He reportedly has a, ‘Do Not Yell At List,’ which a former aide apparently admitted is very small, and just this week, a different former aide accused him of sexual harassment. Even before the current scandals, there was something gross about Cuomo’s glee in his public adulation last year.”Oliver went on to cite more examples, such as the governor’s appearances with his brother Chris Cuomo on CNN, his co-signing of the term “cuomosexuals,” and a book he published last October about the lessons he learned from the pandemic.“And those press conferences where Cuomo loved to insist on the importance of facts now play a little differently after everything we’ve learned,” John Oliver added. “The thing is, it’s hard to follow the facts if the people in charge of those facts are actively withholding them from you.”You can follow Alana Mastrangelo onFacebookand Twitter at@ARmastrangelo, on Parler@alana, and onInstagram."

You have been fighting the Jihadists since the 1050s, and now that you have a chance to take them on away from your homeland, and you want to stop now?It’s called ‘The Long War’ for a reason…Here is the deal. As much as I respect Michael Scheuer’s service in the CIA, he is ideologically wedded to the idea that he cannot win in the Middle East and therefor should not be there (in fact, as he wrote in his bookMarching Toward Hell, he believes we are in the Middle East because are doing the bidding of “pro-Israel Americans in both partiesand large parts of academia, the media, and Hollywood– complemented by what can only be described as superbly effective covert political action by Israel’s intelligence service – [who have entwined] U.S. support for Israel ever more deeply and inextricably into U.S. domestic politics.” Pro-Israel Americans in large parts of academia, the media, and Hollywood ??? When did that happen?).The War on Terror is called “The Long War” for a reason. The question to ask is not “are we there yet?”, it’s “are we moving in the right direction?”. To borrow from a few of my favorite Reagan speeches (“A Time for Choosing”and the“Evil Empire” speech), against this enemy peace without victory is only an illusion of peace. How long did it take to win the Cold War? How long did it take for El Cid and his successors to drive the caliphate from Spain? So, when the liberals forced our defeat in Vietnam, or when the jihadists wounded El Cid (historians claim that arrow in the heart killed him, but they don’t know what they are talking about because he recovered and works for Breitbart), did that mean that the West lost?In Iraq (for these analyses I rely heavily on The Institute for the Study of War),General Petraeus’s 2007-2008 counterinsurgency offensivecrippled Al-Qaeda in Iraq to the point where it is no longer capable of seizing power by force – and the newly regrouped Iraqi Army proved its growing capabilities inthe March-May 2008  battle for Basra, during which the Iraqis took back this key city from deeply entrenched Iranian-backed Shia terrorists, and then proceeded to crack down on the Shia terrorist groups across the South. Things have been largely quiet ever since, with the occasional terrorist attack which, while horrific, do not seriously threaten stability – thanks to the ever improving performance of Iraqi security forces. The main threat comes from Iran’s ability to influence the political scene, as Mr. Scheuer points out. What he misses, however, is thatwe also have and can maintain a significant influence over the political process as well, especially do to our remarkably close relationship with Iraqi security forces. And over at Pajama’s Media, Michael Ledeensayshe is hearing reports that ” the Obama administration is now considering more forceful action against Iran in Iraq”. Do I have criticisms of the situation in Iraq? I certainly do, especially over the failure to provide adequate protection to Iraqi Christians – who have been a target of the Jihadists. But to say that we lost the war is a sentiment that, I believe, cannot stand up to objective scrutiny.As to Afghanistan, it certainly is a tougher situation, and while there are encouraging developments, as retired four-star General Jack Keane – one of the masterminds of the Surge in Iraq –discussedwith Frank Gaffney on Secure Freedom Radio, I believe we aren’t taking the situation seriously enough. The ridiculous rules of engagement (ROEs) that are getting our brave Military men and women killed are a scandal and disgrace. Farther, when our Generals ask for a certain number of troops, especially Generals as accomplished as Stanley McChrystal why are they being shortchanged? Why not have the force levels necessary to replicate what General Keane describes in other parts of the country, instead of doing everything half-asked? In Afghanistan, we don’t necessarily need a strong central Government – the corruption in Kabul is actually a major impediment to our efforts. On this problem, two more of the Iraq Surge’s masterminds, Fred and Kimberly Kagan,writefor The Institute for the Study of War that:Improvements to Afghan governance will come through greater local participation in representative institutions in the Pashtun areas. This is not a foreign, ideological drive to “democratize” Afghanistan, but rather a recognition that local representative institutions are the foundation of Pashtun tribal culture.Pashtun cultural traditions, which have eroded over time and can fairly be said to be norms only in some areas, have been produced by skeptics of success in Afghanistan as evidence that the Pashtuns are fundamentally unconquerable and also ungovernable.The fact that the U.S. and its allies are trying neither to conquer nor to govern Afghanistan is often lost in this discussion. The issue at hand is not whether Westerners can govern Afghanistan, but whether or not Afghans can and, if so, what such an Afghan government would look like. The history of Afghanistan before 1978 (and even, to some extent, since then) strongly suggests not only that Afghanistan is governable, but that there is considerable consensus among Afghans about the general shape the government should take.The current government structure runs counter to traditional Pashtun expectations about the relationship between local communities and the central government because it excludes the communities from having a meaningful voice in almost any decision. It hyper-empowers the executive vis-à-vis representative bodies at every level. This imbalance of powers generates a feeling of alienation and resentment among many Afghans, particularly Pashtuns. It has also facilitated discriminatory and predatory government behavior that fuels a sense of injustice and, therefore, passive and active support for the insurgency. Corruption and abuse-of-power must be addressed by the United States because they fuel the insurgency. Our challenge is not eliminate corruption in Afghanistan but to help the Afghan political leadership behave sufficiently in accord with Pashtun norms that groups that now feel marginalized and preyed-upon see an advantage in at least tolerating the new order.The emergence of a functional and credible local security program in 2010 is perhaps the most striking and unexpected development–and potentially one of the most important. The Afghan Local Police (ALP) program is designed to extend the reach of Afghan and Coalition forces to rural areas rather than to replace them. Perhaps more importantly, ALP empowers villages and clusters of villages–not tribes–to resist the Taliban by supporting the consensus decisions of local elders arrived at in traditional Pashtun ways. It brings these traditional local structures into coherence with the central government at the level of the district–ALP sites are subordinated to district chiefs of police. This program offers a promising view of what at least part of the ultimate political solution to this conflict might look like.There are other problems, and other recommendations to those problems, but the point is that defeat is not inevitable.I believe we conservatives should not take the idea of walking away from the war against the barbarians who attacked us laying down – leave that for the left to advocate."

Unemployment, presently at a low of 4.7 percent, is directly tied to inflation forecasts.“The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years,” the minutes said.Nine members of the board voted for the rate increase, and just one voted against. Previously, the Federal Reserve said it anticipated three rate increases in 2017, the March hike being the first. Last week, a non-voting Fed member voiced support for four increases in 2017."

Rather, as the first line declares: “America has always been bad, no matter who the president is or was.”The article continues:Since Trump’s election, however, the qualities that make America particularly bad—racism, sexism, homophobia, the institutionalized manifestations of each of these, et cetera—have been emboldened, forcing many people to reckon with the ugly reality of their beloved USA. “This is not America,” I keep hearing. But the truth of the matter is that family separation, a disregardfor Black lives, homophobia, and every other incarnation of white male supremacy are exactly what America is made of.The piece is not a satire. It includes advice for surviving the anniversary of American independence, including holding a Fourth of July event “focusing [on] a minority community you belong to” (who, the article presumes, might also dislike America) or purchasing party supplies ” from businesses owned and operated by indigenous people or other communities who face systemic disadvantages in the US.”Ettachfini also suggests that, if the Fourth of Julymustbe celebrated, then readers should focus on those fighting the system, including Rep.

SecureWorks, another cybersecurity consultant, says Podesta’s emails were hacked by the same groups who hacked the DNC.— On December 9-10, the Washington Post and New York Times report that the CIA concluded Moscow intended to help Trump’s campaign by releasing the hacked material.The billionaire president-elect dismisses the CIA conclusion as “ridiculous”. Russia denies all claims.— On December 12, leading Congressional lawmakers call for an investigation into Russia’s alleged role in the cyberattacks.— On December 15, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says his campaign accounts were also hacked by Russians ahead of the November vote.— On December 29, Obama announces a barrage of sanctions for Moscow over the alleged attacks, including the deportation of 35 suspected intelligence agents and sanctions against the GRU and FSB intelligence agencies.The FBI and Department of Homeland Security also release a briefing to provide “technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election.”– Could Russia pull this off? –The talents of Russian state-serving hackers are now the stuff of legend.Descended from the tradition of Soviet economic espionage, they broadened the scope to also probe and punish political targets.Russia was blamed for a cyberattack on Estonia in 2007, when the Baltic state’s main internet sites crashed after being flooded with surplus requests, in a so-called distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack. It knocked out the national emergency hotline for more than an hour.Other Russian neighbours including Ukraine and Georgia, as well as states which have strained relations with Moscow, have endured similar attacks.The US election hacking looks like a Russian state-sponsored strike, Andrey Soldatov, editor-in-chief of Agenta.ru and a specialist on Russian secret services and cybercrime, told AFP.“Given Russia’s history of cyberattacks, I would think this is a case of coordination between private and government actors, involving informal actors coordinated by those at the highest levels,” Soldatov said.The campaign hackers did not need innovative technical skills to strike; simple “phishing” emails, which invite email readers to click on a link, were enough to get the hackers in.– All for Trump? –Experts have not reached a consensus on whether Russia set out to help Trump clinch a White House victory, as Clinton’s team says.Soldatov says it is likely that the Kremlin sought to weaken the position of the former secretary of state, whom it views as “a kind of sworn enemy” and has blamed for inciting unrest after Russia’s own elections in 2011.“But I’m not certain the principal goal was to get Trump elected. These guys at the Kremlin are believers in conspiracy theories,” he said, noting that up until the November 8 vote Moscow had warned that potential voter fraud could steal the election from Trump."

Our culture, we don’t eat the same breakfast cereal anymore. We don’t read the same newspapers. We don’t consume the same news. We’re divided in every way, shape, and form  in our culture, and thus it translates downstream into our politics. I personally think — and not that I’m hoping, I’m just an observer — but I think the United States is heading toward a breakup. It’s already happening.”Shirley considered how external threats to the U.S. across its history, such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, galvanized Americans of varying political orientations around a common purpose. Contemporary examples of such threats such as the Islamic terrorist attacks of September 11, he added, provided short-lived political unity.He said, “This country has always been about about division and compromise, and that’s how we move forward. And so, really, December 7th and subsequent months and years is all about the unity of this country, which we’ve never seen before, and probably will never see again. Even after September 11, unity of America fell apart after a couple of months.”“I think we started to erode, we started to fall back on our divisions right after [World War II]. The entry into the United Nations and the charter for the United Nations — which happened in San Francisco right at the end of the war — was met with sharp division. ‘Shall we join the U.N. and become an internationalist country? Should we go back to being isolationists?'”He continued, “We’ve gone back to being a divided nation, and I think we’re even more divided today.”Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern."
6423199655,http://www.breitbart.com/news/tourniquet-killer-executed-in-texas-for-1992-strangling/,‘Tourniquet Killer’ executed in Texas for 1992 strangling,"HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — Texas carried out the nation’s first execution of 2018 Thursday evening, giving lethal injection to a man who became known as Houston’s “Tourniquet Killer” because of his signature murder technique on four female victims.Anthony Allen Shore was put to death for one of those slayings, the 1992 killing of a 21-year-old woman whose body was dumped in the drive-thru of a Houston Dairy Queen.In his final statement, Shore, 55, was apologetic and his voice cracked with emotion.“No amount of words or apology could ever undo what I’ve done,” Shore said. “I wish I could undo the past, but it is what it is.”He was pronounced dead at 6:28 p.m. CST.Shore’s lawyers argued in appeals he suffered brain damage early in life that went undiscovered by his trial attorneys and affected Shore’s decision to disregard their advice when he told his trial judge he wanted the death penalty. A federal appeals court last year turned down his appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review his case and the six-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously rejected a clemency petition.Shore’s attorneys said his appeals were exhausted. They filed no last-minute attempts to try to halt his execution.In 1998, Shore received eight years’ probation and became a registered sex offender for sexually assaulting two relatives. Five years later, Shore was arrested for the 1992 slaying of Maria del Carmen Estrada after a tiny particle recovered from under her fingernail was matched to his DNA.“I didn’t set out to kill her,” he told police in a taped interview played at his 2004 trial. “That was not my intent. But it got out of hand.”Estrada was walking to work around 6:30 a.m. on April 16, 1992, when he she accepted a ride from him. The former tow truck driver, phone company repairman and part-time musician blamed his actions on “voices in my head that I was going to have her, regardless, to possess her in some way.”He also confessed to killing three others, a 9-year-old and two teenagers. All four of his victims were Hispanic and at least three had been raped. Jurors also heard from three women who testified he raped them.Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, who as an assistant prosecutor worked the then-unsolved Estrada case, said crime scene photos showed Estrada was tortured and had suffered as a stick was used to tighten a cord around her neck.“I know this case, I know his work and the death penalty is appropriate,” she said. “A jury in this case gave Shore death. … I think he’s reached the end of the road and now it’s up to government to complete the job.”Besides Estrada, Shore confessed to the slayings of Laurie Tremblay, 15, found beside a trash bin outside a Houston restaurant in 1986; Diana Rebollar, 9, abducted while walking to a neighborhood grocery store in 1994; and Dana Sanchez, 16, who disappeared in 1995 while hitchhiking to her boyfriend’s home in Houston.Sanchez’s body was found after a caller to a Houston TV station provided directions on where to find it. Police believe Shore was the caller.Shore’s execution originally was set for last October but was delayed for an investigation after another Texas death row inmate concocted a scheme to get Shore to take responsibility for his crimes.In 2017, 23 convicted killers were put to death in the U.S., seven of them in Texas, more than another state. Three more inmates are scheduled to die in Texas in the coming weeks."

The 16-year-olds behind the attack partially confessed to the bombing  which wounded three people, including a 60-year-old Sikh priest who was seriously hurt.The attack took place at 7pm following a wedding that attracted over 200 people at the temple run by the Sikh Gurdwara Nanaksar congregation.This Friday police in Essen announced that another two teens had been placed in police custody, both 16-years-old. Police said that all four of the teens were known to them and that they maintained close ties with a local Salafist organization. All four are said to be sympathizers of the Islamic state and have known criminal backgrounds. The courts are currently looking into whether or not to prosecute the Salafist group as a terrorist organization as  defined under the German constitutionreportsTagesspiegel.The authorities pointed out that the membership of the young Salafists is probably much larger than the four young men arrested. An expert said the amount of radicalisation among the young Muslims in Essen was frightening.One of the young men was said to have posted a video of notorious jihadiDenis Cuspert, known by his rap name “Deso Dogg.” Cuspert is thought to have been behind several beheadings of ISIS prisoners and led recruitment for the group until his alleged death by a U.S.air strikelast October in Syria.Regardless of his death, Cuspert still maintains a huge influence on young German Muslims who look to him as an inspiration to wage jihad for the Islamic State.The 15-year-old girl whostabbeda policeman in Hanover earlier this year was another minor who is said to have been inspired by ISIS propaganda.  The girl is said to have tried to join ISIS in Syria but was stopped in Turkey by her mother.The teen returned to Germany still radicalized and carried out the attack.Federal and State authorities in Germany have noted the high number of minors attempting to join ISIS in Syria as alarming. In the month of September alone some 80 boys and girls aged 15-18 attempted or succeeded in travelling to Syria. Most of the young jihadists hadn’t even graduated from high school.Another shocking figure is the amount of underage “martyrs” ISIS claim have sacrificed their lives for jihad. According to a study from the US Military academy West Point, 89 children had either died in combat operations or as suicide bombers for ISIS.Most of the “martyrdoms” occurred in northern Iraq where ISIS has faced increasingly heavy resistance from the Iraqi army, but also in Syria, Libya and Yemen.  Of the 89 killed, 6 are known to have been under the age of 14.After watching one particular ISIS video in which children are taught tobeheadusing teddy bears a Dutch intelligence official warned, “These are the terrorists of tomorrow.”"

Fatima Avelica, his U.S.-born 13-year-old daughter, captured the incident on video, and can be heard crying in the background.Up to 100 people, including his family, were at the rally, KTLA 5 reported. Fatima was at the rally on Monday but was too distraught to speak. Another one of Avelica-Gonzalez’s daughters spoke at the event.“My dad is very strong and that’s why we are here. To be strong for him, and as a community we can do big things,” she said.Avelica-Gonzalez remains in ICE custody. In 2009, Avelica-Gonzalez was convicted of driving under the influence. In 2014, a court ordered his removal from the United States. An ICE representative said he was detained “because relevant databases indicate he has multiple prior criminal convictions.”Avelica-Gonzalez’s lawyer said his client, a citizen of Mexico, has lived in the United States for more than 25 years.“I was in grade school when he arrived in this country. He’s paid his taxes, and he and his family have raised four beautiful U.S. citizen daughters,” lawyer Peter Greyshock said. “[They’re] strong, independent women who are making the best of their community and rising to leadership levels.”On Jan. 25, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to strip federal grant money from so-called “sanctuary cities” — U.S. municipalities that protect undocumented immigrants from federal prosecution. Trump’s order also seeks to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, to build more detention centers and to prioritize undocumented immigrants for deportation.Greyshock said Avelica-Gonzalez has applied for a U-visa, which will keep him in the United States under special circumstances but the approval process could take up to four years."

1900194118,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA9LAEPG0,Both sides agree: No major budget deal foreseen,"(AP) Both sides agree: No major budget deal foreseenBy ANDREW TAYLORAssociated PressWASHINGTONOn this, GOP budget guru Rep. Paul Ryan and top Senate Democrat Harry Reid can agree: There won’t be a “grand bargain” on the budget.Instead, the Wisconsin Republican and the Nevada Democrat both say the best Washington can do in this bitterly partisan era of divided government is a small-ball bargain that tries to take the edge off of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration.Official Capitol Hill negotiations start next week, but Ryan and Reid both weighed in Thursday to tamp down any expectations that the talks might forge a large-scale agreement where several previous high-level talks have failed.Long-standing, entrenched differences over taxes make a large-scale budget pact virtually impossible, according to lawmakers, their aides and observers who will be monitoring the talks.Republicans say they simply won’t agree to any further taxes atop the 10-year, $600 billion-plus tax increase on upper-income earners that President Barack Obama and Democrats muscled through Congress in January. Without higher taxes, Democrats say they won’t yield to cuts in benefit programs like Medicare.“If we focus on some big, grand bargain then we’re going to focus on our differences, and both sides are going to require that the other side compromises some core principle and then we’ll get nothing done,” Ryan, who chairs the House Budget Committee, said in an interview Thursday. “So we aren’t focusing on a grand bargain because I don’t think in this divided government you’ll get one.”In an interview Thursday with Nevada public radio station KNPR, Reid, the Senate majority leader, agreed that a large-scale grand bargain wasn’t in the cards.“They have their mind set on doing nothing, nothing more on revenue, and until they get off that kick, there’s not going to be a grand bargain,” Reid said. “We’re just going to have to do something to work our way through sequestration.”Ryan, his party’s vice presidential nominee a year ago, and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., are two of the key congressional figures in the talks. They both say they’re seeking common ground between the sharply different Republican and Democratic budgets.Common ground, however, is a much different concept than compromise. It involves finding ideas upon which they can agree rather than compromising principles such as Republican opposition to tax increases or the unwillingness by many Democrats to consider cutting future Social Security benefits by decreasing the annual cost-of-living adjustments.Instead of a broad agreement encompassing tax hikes and structural curbs on the growth of benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Ryan says he’s seeking a “smaller, more achievable objective.”The talks, he said, also will focus on alleviating another upcoming round of automatic spending cuts and replacing them with longer-term cuts.Sequestration mostly hits so-called discretionary spending, the money approved by Congress each year to run agency operations. Ryan wants to cut autopilot-like spending on entitlement programs like Medicare to ease sequestration’s effects on both the Pentagon and domestic programs.“I think we all agree that there’s a smarter way to cut spending” than sequestration, Ryan said. “If I can reform entitlement programs where the savings compound annually … that is more valuable for reducing the debt than a one-time spending cut in discretionary spending.”The White House and Democrats are pressing to include new revenue from closing tax loopholes and infrastructure spending to boost the economy.“Even if we do not have the big grand bargain, if you were to have a medium deal or small deal, those deals could have permanent loophole closures and permanent mandatory savings that would help our permanent long-term fiscal situation,” senior White House official Gene Sperling told a business group Friday.The automatic spending cuts are required because a 2011 deficit-reduction supercommittee failed to reach an agreement. The cuts would carve $91 billion from the day-to-day budgets of the Pentagon and domestic agencies in 2014 compared with the spending caps set by a 2011 budget deal. The Pentagon would absorb almost 60 percent of the cuts.While the first official meeting of the larger House-Senate negotiating team is scheduled for next week, Ryan and Murray have been talking already.Republicans are looking at a bushel basket of cuts to Medicare health care providers contained in Obama’s budget. They also have voiced support for curbing Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, an idea Obama has backed, but only in the context of a broader deal in which Republicans would allow tax increases. That proposal won’t fly in the current talks.There are also several supercommittee ideas like curbing Postal Service cost overruns, making federal workers contribute more to their pensions and raising premiums on higher-income Medicare beneficiaries.Democrats, meanwhile, are wary of using cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs to ease cuts in the defense budget. Negotiators still might explore curbing generous military retirement, health care and prescription drug benefits as a way to restore cuts to readiness and procurement of weapons systems.“Congressional Democrats and the White House, rightly in my view, don’t want to use domestic entitlement cuts to offset easing or eliminating the defense side of sequestration on top of the nondefense discretionary side,” said Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities."

Complex Continues to Build Near Highways,"LOS ANGELES, California — The developer behind downtown Los Angeles’s seven-story Da Vinci complex, one building of which was deemeda complete lossafter a massive fire engulfed its wooden frame, has a history of building densely populated structures near highways. This is a testament to the increasing sparsity of land and rising costs which have pushed developers towards building in high-traffic areas that would otherwise be less desirable.“When the economy is perceived as robust, and developers come out of the woodwork because inventories are low, they build wherever they can seek to make a profit,” said Sotheby’s International broker, Shamon Shamonki, to Breitbart News. “It’s an economic decision of availability.”When searching for a residence, one cannot help but refer to the adage of “location, location, location.” And the sheer volume of noise and air pollution from vehicles that frequent areas that are in close proximity to freeways has always been a major source of contention. However, the influx of people coming to Los Angeles in search of a place to live has pushed many to bypass the criterion for residence. Shamonki says that clients are willing to “sacrifice specific location for general location,” and Da Vinci’s developer, Geoffrey H. Palmer, has maximized on that factor.What sets Palmer’s developments apart is the number of units he has created around the four-level interchange in downtown Los Angeles.Palmer’s over-3,000 units, which are either developed or in the process of being developed, also include the likes of the632-unit Medici Apartments (on South Bixel Street) and his 913-unit Lorenzo Apartments (on West Adams Boulevard, near the University of Southern California). Both of these structures are merely blocks away from the 110 Freeway entrance, and they mirror his Da Vinci complex.“I think his style is kind of that Mediterraneanlook” that is emblematic of Southern California residential structures, said Matthew Chavez, who works as a realtor with Rodeo Realty.Although the Da Vinci’s building B wascompletely destroyed in the flames, Palmer has stated on his website that his development’s unscathed building A willopen as scheduled, in January of 2015.The Los Angeles Fire Department has enlisted the help of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) National Response Team in investigating the cause of the historic conflagration.Palmer’s Da Vinci complex was met with great criticism earlier this year, particularly over his intent to build a pedestrian bridge allowing residents to bypass the streets below; the move was seen as“anti-homeless” people. Downtown Los Angeles is still in the development process as it seeks to build an image to mirror what Manhattan, New York, has achieved.The LAFD has been treating the investigation as criminal andhas not yet ruled out terrorism.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter@AdelleNaz."
6125360814,http://www.breitbart.com/news/no-rafa-vs-roger-at-us-open-del-potro-beats-federer-in-qf/,No Rafa vs. Roger at US Open: del Potro beats Federer in QF,"NEW YORK (AP) — So much for the first U.S. Open matchup between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.Federer failed to live up to his end of the bargain.Hours after Nadal did his part with an easy-as-can-be victory to get to the semifinals at Flushing Meadows, Federer was unable to join him for what would have been the most-anticipated showdown of the entire two weeks, wasting chances to take control and missing makable shots in a 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4 loss to 2009 champion Juan Martin del Potro on Wednesday night.Federer entered the quarterfinals with an 18-0 Grand Slam record this season, including titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon to raise his record count to 19 major championships.But he tweaked his back at a tournament last month, curtailing his preparation for the U.S. Open, and he was not quite at his best for stretches. He needed five sets to win each of his first two matches — and Wednesday, he succumbed to the same formula of massive forehands and booming serves that del Potro used when he upset Federer in the final eight years ago.Before the tournament began, Nadal was honest as can be when asked whether he hoped to face Federer at the only Grand Slam tournament where they’ve never met.The answer, the No. 1-seeded Nadal said earnestly, was no — because he’d rather go up against someone easier to beat.Well, as it turns out, he’ll go up against del Potro on Friday, when the other semifinal features two men who have never been this far at any major: No. 12 Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain vs. No. 28 Kevin Anderson of South Africa.Nadal, who has won two of his 15 Grand Slam trophies in New York, overwhelmed 19-year-old Russian Andrey Rublev 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 in the quarterfinals, then had to wait hours to see what Federer would do under the lights.Arthur Ashe Stadium was packed, and both men had loud groups of supporters. Federer’s fans would cheer for del Potro’s faults, considered bad etiquette in tennis. Del Potro’s faction would break into raucous, soccer-style songs of “Ole, ole, ole, ole! Del-po! Del-po!”“Well, I think it’s my home court, too,” del Potro said in an on-court interview.The 2-hour, 51-minute contest was filled with some sublime shotmaking by each player, and some real moments of shakiness for the 36-year-old Federer, whose forehand in particular was problematic. The turning point was the third-set tiebreaker, which Federer was a single point from winning on four occasions.At 6-4, del Potro hammered a good return that caught Federer off-guard, resulting in a forehand into the net. At 6-5, del Potro delivered a service winner. At 7-6 — set up by a double-fault from del Potro — Federer missed a backhand, and his wife, Mirka, put her hands to her temples, before standing to offer encouragement. At 8-7, Federer’s fourth and last set point, del Potro hit a huge forehand winner.That began a run of three points in a row for del Potro to claim that set, the last when Federer pushed a backhand volley long.The suspense in the fourth set was brief: At 2-all, Federer dumped an overhead into the bottom of the net to gift a third break point of the game, which del Potro converted with a stinging cross-court backhand return winner to nose ahead for good.Del Potro showed no ill effects from his 3 1/2-hour, five-set comeback victory in the fourth round — or the illness that’s been bothering him and had the 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Argentine coughing into a towel late in the second set. His forehands were powerful and precise, including one reflex pass hit so hard and so close to Federer’s head that he ducked out of the way.Federer was uncharacteristically off at moments, including a very bad forehand volley that was way off the mark and set up del Potro’s match point.Nadal, meanwhile, strolled past the 53rd-ranked Rublev.“He gave me a lesson,” acknowledged Rublev, the youngest U.S. Open quarterfinalist since Andy Roddick in 2001.Rublev didn’t put up much of a fight, with seven double-faults among his 43 unforced errors.“I will try now to practice harder to improve everything for the next time if we play each other,” Rublev said, “to try to compete better.”Truth is, the way Nadal is playing at the moment, few would be able to offer much in the way of a challenge.He has won his past three matches in straight sets, his uppercut of a forehand at its dangerous best.“He’s been playing better and better every day,” said Carlos Moya, the 1998 French Open champion who is helping coach Nadal. “The last couple of matches have been very good. He is confident. He had a few doubts at the beginning of the tournament that I believe now are gone and he is able to play his best tennis.”___Follow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich___More AP tennis coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis"

Your world is through.'”“Let me tell you something: when you want something in this world, the Jew holds the door.”“The powerful Jews are my enemy.”“The Jews were responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out, turning men into women and women into men.”“The mother and father of apartheid … the Jews.”This is nothing new coming from Farrakhan.

When it came to thisphotoof Obama and Farrakhan together, which was taken a mere three years before Obama ran for president, until Obama was safely out of elected office, the media completely covered it up.Democrat National Committee Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison (D-MN)According to numerous reports, Ellison’s connections to Farrakhan are not only deep; the Democrat congressman hasrepeatedly lied about them. Nevertheless, he remains a deputy chairman of the whole Democrat Party.Maxine Waters (D-CA)According to theDaily Caller, this powerful congresswoman, who constantly smears President Trump as racist, not only attended a Farrakhan speech, but was treated as a guest of honor.“We have Maxine Waters here,” Farrakhan said to a cheering audience, “our great congresswoman from this area.”Here is 2006 video of Farrakhan meeting with numerous members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Waters. The two of them hug like old friends at the 3:47 mark:Barbara Lee (D-CA)In the same 2006 video embedded above,Lee is present.Danny Davis (D-IL)Davis, who has been in Congress for 21 years, has nothing but praise for the racist, anti-Semitic Farrakhan.“I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis toldThe Daily Caller. “I don’t regard Louis Farrakhan as an aberration or anything, I regard him as an outstanding human being who commands a following of individuals who are learned and articulate and he plays a big role in the lives of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.”André Carson (D-IN)Carson met with the hate preacher in a hotel suite in 2015, refused to condemn his anti-Semitism, andwill not rule outfuture meetings.James Clyburn (D-SC)Clyburn is the third-highest-ranking Democrat in the House, and in 2011, heshared a stagewith Farrakhan.

6555346879,http://www.breitbart.com/news/britain-points-at-putin-in-poisoning-attack-as-gulf-widens/,Britain points at Putin in poisoning attack as gulf widens,"MOSCOW (AP) — The gulf between Russia and Britain widened on Friday as they cranked up pressure over a nerve agent attack and a suspected murder in Britain that have deepened Western worries about alleged Russian meddling abroad.Britain’s foreign secretary accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of personally ordering the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, describing it as the most brazen such move since World War II.Putin’s spokesman denounced the claim as “shocking and inexcusable.”As relations between the two nations sank to a new post-Cold War low, nearly two dozen Russian diplomats in London were packing their bags to leave Tuesday after an expulsion order from Britain. British diplomats in Moscow were bracing for a retaliatory order from the Kremlin and were just waiting to be told who had to leave and when.Geopolitical tensions have been mounting since the poisoning of the Skripals in the English city of Salisbury on March 4, in what Western powers see as the latest sign of increasingly aggressive Russian interference in foreign countries. The tensions threaten to overshadow Putin’s expected re-election Sunday for another six-year presidential term.But that’s not all.New concerns surfaced Friday about the death this week of a London-based Russian businessman, Nikolai Glushkov, found dead at his south London home on Monday. British police said Friday that he died from compression to the neck and opened a murder investigation.Russia also suspects foul play in Glushkov’s death and opened its own inquiry Friday. Russia’s top agency for major crimes was also investigating the attack on Yulia Skripal, who is a Russian citizen. Her father has British citizenship. Both are in critical condition.British police said there is no apparent link to the attack on Glushkov and the poisoning of the Skripals.But to the West, they are raising similar concerns.While Britain has accused the Russian state of ordering the poisoning of the Skripals, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson took it a step further Friday and said it’s “overwhelmingly likely” that Putin himself ordered the attack.Top EU diplomats were expected to discuss next steps at a meeting Monday, with some calling for a boycott of the upcoming World Cup in Russia. British Prime Minister Theresa May is seeking a global coalition of countries to punish Moscow, and the U.S., France and Germany have already lined up against Russia over the Skripal attack.Britain is expelling 23 Russian diplomats and taking other steps against Russian interests as the two nations’ relations plummet.“Our quarrel is with Putin’s Kremlin, and with his decision, and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision, to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the U.K., on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War,” Johnson said.Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by Russian news agencies as calling Johnson’s statement a “shocking and inexcusable breach of diplomatic propriety.” Peskov reiterated Russian denials of involvement in the attack on the Skripals.“We have never encountered this level of discussion on the global stage,” Peskov told reporters.Russia ordered a halt to high-level meetings with the U.K. and prepared Friday to expel British diplomats.Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told The Associated Press that the Salisbury attack was a direct challenge to Europe. He said Russia’s recent provocations need a tough response, including action against Russian oligarchs with questionable ties who have used London as a safe haven.The source of the nerve agent — which Britain says is Soviet-made Novichok — is unclear, as is the way it was administered.Russia has demanded that Britain share samples collected by investigators.Russia’s envoy to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told The AP that his country has no stocks of the Novichok group of nerve agents, insisting that Soviet-era research into the agents was totally dismantled before Russia joined the organization.Ambassador Alexander Shulgin also sought to shift possible blame, saying Western special agents spirited Russian chemical weapons experts out of the country in the 1990s and work continued on their research.He said even the name Novichok was a “Western invention” and that Russia never gave it a name.Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former commander of the British Army’s chemical and biological weapons regiment, called the claim that U.S. or British agents could have developed Novichok “complete hogwash.”Speaking to the AP, he called it unlikely that some of the nerve agent could have gone missing in the years after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. He also cast doubt on the possibility that the nerve agent was sent through the mail or was placed in luggage that Skripal’s daughter brought with her from Russia to Britain.An 83-year-old Russian whistleblower who helped develop Novichok told the AP on Friday that no other country could have used that particular nerve agent to poison a former spy.Vil Mirzayanov, who now lives in New Jersey, said that if the substance is Novichok, as Britain claims, it’s “100 percent” clear it came from Russia.Mirzayanov revealed details of Russia’s chemical weapons in the 1990s because he said he was afraid of their impact.While many British politicians have backed the government in blaming Moscow for the nerve agent attack, the U.K.’s main opposition leader has cautioned against a rush to judgment. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said in the Guardian that it’s possible that “Russian mafia-like groups,” rather than the Russian state, were responsible.___Lawless reported from London.

7052777593,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2014/03/28/former-christie-aide-s-lawyer-condemns-bridgegate-report-as-venomous-sexist/,"Former Christie Aide's Lawyer Condemns Bridgegate Report as 'Venomous,' 'Sexist'","JERSEY CITY, New Jersey–An attorney representing former Governor Chris Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly has condemned the results of a report commissioned by the governor that implicates Kelly in the George Washington Bridge scandal as containing “inappropriate sexist remarks” regarding her romantic history.Attorney Michael Critchleyissued a statementto theStar-Ledgerlate Friday afternoon responding to the several-hundred-page report on the scandal now known as Bridgegate compiled by attorneys working for the Governor’s office. He noted in the statement that the report was missing “crucial” facts that only Kelly could provide, and that, given that any evidence Kelly had to exonerate herself could potentially implicate the governor further, the attack on her character was “not surprising.” The statement, pithy though not specific, also accused the report of using Kelly’s gender to imply that she was more likely to have committed improprieties on the job than others involved in the “traffic study.”“The report’s venomous, gratuitous, and inappropriate sexist remarks concerning Ms. Kelly have no place in what is alleged to be a professional and independent report,” Critchley remarked in the statement. He added that Kelly is “not a liar” and “is a single mother of four children who was deeply devoted and committed to her job at the Office of the Governor.”Critics have accused the report,released this week, of using the personal relationships Kelly engaged in to impugn her character and imply a motive for causing havoc in the suburban town of Fort Lee. The reportrevealed publicly for the first timethat Kelly had dated Bill Stepien, Christie’s former campaign manager, for a short time, and the relationship had ended before Port Authority official David Wildstein closed down lanes on the bridge in September. The report claims that Stepien, whowas fired on the same day as Kellyin January, chose to end the relationship and the two rarely spoke after the parting.That the two appeared not to be on speaking terms would diminish the possibility that Kelly would involve Stepien in the bridge incident given its unethical nature. The report thus concluded that Kelly was the only person in the Governor’s office who knew of the incident. Kelly had directly implicated herself in emails the New Jersey Legislature released in January in which she wrote to Wildstein, “time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.“On Friday, Governor Christieheld his first press conferencesince that email became public to announce radical reforms which he would attempt to enact with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. He also announced that Port Authority Chairman David Samson, implicated in claims by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that the Christie administration used Hurricane Sandy relief funds to extort her into approving a redevelopment project, had tendered his resignation effective immediately. Exhibiting a zest for sparring with reporters that had diminished in the months since the scandal rose to prominence, Christie insisted that he had faith in the results of the report and insisted he was not involved in shutting down the bridge lanes."
7069232849,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/06/25/hank-paulson-cites-hillarys-globalist-platform-reason-endorsement/,Hank ‘Meltdown’ Paulson Cites Hillary’s Globalist Platform as Reason for Endorsement,"Hank Paulson, George W. Bush’s treasury secretary, who presided over both the meltdown of the U.S. economy and the subsequent bailout of his close friends and associates, has endorsed Hillary Clinton — citing his belief that she’d be more likely to enact globalist policies on trade and immigration as part of the reason for his endorsement.Paulson also posits that Clinton would be more likely to cut Americans’ medicare and social security, which Paulson cites as a top priority following the financial collapse he helped to create.Paulson is also the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, which has given Hillary Clinton hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches. According toPolitico,Goldman Sachs rewarded Clinton with a total of $675,000 for three paid speeches.“When Hillary Clinton spoke to Goldman Sachs executives and technology titans at a summit in Arizona in October of 2013, she spoke glowingly of the work the bank was doing raising capital and helping create jobs, according to people who saw her remarks,” Politicowrites. “She spent no time criticizing Goldman or Wall Street more broadly for its role in the 2008 financial crisis.”“It was pretty glowing about us,” one attendeetoldPolitico, “She sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director.”In his Fridayop-edin theWashington Post, Paulson writes:When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump. I will not cast a write-in vote. I’ll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world.Paulson’s op-ed adopts the similar lecturing tone to what was called “Project Fear” in the UK, in which the Remain campaign recruited executives from multinational firms and establishment politicians to convince the victims of globalization that they had to remain in their current economic structure– or else.Paulson says that, in his view, the way to strengthen our economy is to push for even more globalist policies on trade. This is precisely what George W. Bush and Bill Clinton did throughout their presidencies. Paulson insists that “it’s wrong to tell the American people” that we achieve economic success by “walling ourselves off from the remaining 7 billion people and the markets they represent”:We need to welcome rather than shrink from trade and economic competition. Trump calls our current trade deals “disgusting, the absolute worst ever negotiated by any country in the world.” This is simply false. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the average American household income is roughly $10,000 higher because of the postwar expansion of trade. Because of trade, we add jobs and foster innovation and competitiveness. That doesn’t mean that people aren’t losing jobs and suffering in certain industries. However, it is wrong to tell the American people that we can turn back the clock and win, with merely 4 percent of the world’s population, by walling ourselves off from the remaining 7 billion people and the markets they represent. Instead, we need to fix the programs that help U.S. industries and workers transition to new and better jobs. We need better training, new education programs and a more robust safety net. The policies Trump endorses would destroy, not save, U.S. jobs.In stark contrast to Trump’s “America first” trade platform, Hillary Clinton has been a vocal champion of the trade globalism that Paulson desires. Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China’s entrance into the WTO, and she boosted the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement–declaringin 2012 that the “TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade.” Clinton expressed no concerns about the TPP’s establishment of a global governing commission, which Jeff Sessions hasdescribedas a “Pacific Union” similar to a “nascent European Union.”Paulson has similarly been a big supporter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In a 2015Wall Street Journalpiece, Paulson wrote: “We should reassert our status as a Pacific power, build on the North American Free Trade Agreement to create greater economic integration closer to home and move forward on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”In his pro-Clinton op-ed, Paulson decries Trump’s campaign pledge to reclaim national sovereignty and reverse the tide of globalism. Paulson writes:With Donald Trump as the presumptive presidential nominee, we are witnessing a populist hijacking of one of the United States’ great political parties. The GOP, in putting Trump at the top of the ticket, is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism. This troubles me deeply as a Republican, but it troubles me even more as an American. Enough is enough. It’s time to put country before party and say it together: Never Trump.Paulson cited his role in George W. Bush’s controversial handling of the economic downturn as giving further credibility to his Clinton endorsement:I’m not the first Republican to say Trump is a phony and should not be president… But as a former chief executive and treasury secretary, I hope to bring an additional perspective to the discussion… I can’t help but wonder what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical. The only reason we avoided another Great Depression was because Republicans and Democrats joined together to vote for the Troubled Asset Relief Program — a vote that they knew would be politically unpopular but in the best interest of our country. Critical to that effort was the leadership of President George W. Bush. As I led Treasury’s efforts to fashion a difficult, imperfect, controversial but essential solution with bipartisan support, I was — and still am — grateful to have had President Bush at the helm.While Paulson accuses Trump of “playing to fears and frustrations, pointing fingers at scapegoats and creating boogeymen: blaming the banks, greedy companies or foreigners for our problems,” he makes no mention of how federal immigration policy has impacted American jobs and wages. Since Ted Kennedy’s 1965 immigration rewrite was passed into law, the U.S. has added 59 million immigrants. Since mass migration began in the 1970s, U.S middle class hasshrunkten percentage points, and real average wages are lower today than they were in 1973.Paulson does not make clear why Americans should trust his economic judgement, considering that he failed completely to predict the housing crash over which he presided."

7069127906,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/05/10/iowa-supreme-court-halts-abortion-waiting-period-law/,Iowa Supreme Court Halts Abortion Waiting Period Law,"The Iowa State Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt to anew state lawthat requires women to wait 72 hours prior to having an abortion.Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Mark Cady’s decision sends the matter back to a district court.Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Iowa filed the lawsuit after Gov. Terry Branstad signed the bill into law. A Polk County district court judge denied the groups’ request for an emergency injunction to halt enforcement of the law, but an appeal led to Justice David Wiggins’ order for a temporary halt.The law, passed in the Iowa state Senate after much debate and along party lines, also restricts abortion to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, although the lawsuit does not address that restriction. No exemptions are provided in the law for rape, incest, or the unborn baby’s potential genetic anomalies. It does allow for abortion past the 20-week point if the mother’s life or health is in danger.According to theDes Moines Register, Planned Parenthood made theclaimthat it has yet to receive the materials it is required to distribute to women seeking abortion under the new law – such as risks associated with the procedure and available options for adoption.The abortion vendor also claims that requiring a waiting period prior to abortion is discriminatory against women.A spokesman for the Iowa attorney general’s office, however, cited a link to theIowa Department of Public Healththat provides the information and has been available to the public even prior to the law’s approval.Cady ordered a new district court hearing within 30 days.“This ruling means that while this case moves through the court, women will continue to have access to the safe, legal abortion care they are constitutionally entitled to receive,” said Dr. Jill Meadows, medical director for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.Meadows added:Just last week, women’s lives were hurled into chaos during the two hours that this law was active. One woman had to return to basic training and feared jeopardizing her military career. One was a high school senior desperate to not become another statistic … Like many women whose circumstances create serious barriers to care — especially rural and low-income women — this disruption created potentially insurmountable obstacles.While the legislation’s original criminal penalties had been removed through the amendment process, it still allows women to file civil suits against abortionists who perform the procedure illegally. Under the measure, doctors may also be disciplined by the Iowa Board of Medicine for performing illegal abortions.According to the Guttmacher Institute, 27 states currentlyrequirea woman to wait – most of them 24 hours – between abortion counseling and the procedure itself. Iowa is the sixth state to require a three-day waiting period. Nineteen states have passed similar 20-week bans.“This is another step in the legal process regarding the 72-hour waiting period,” Branstad spokesman Ben Hammes said about the return of the matter to the district court. “The governor and lieutenant governor fully believe this protection will ultimately be upheld as it has in five other states.”"

6065918053,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/14/sanger-founded-planned-parenthood-urges-standwithcharlottesville-racism/,Margaret Sanger-Founded Planned Parenthood Urges #StandWithCharlottesville Against ‘Racism’,"Planned Parenthood views the horrific events in Charlottesville Saturday as white supremacists’ desire to deny abortion to minorities.The organization – founded byeugenicistMargaret Sanger – is urging its supporters to #StandWithCharlottesville against “racism” and “white supremacy.”“Racial justice is reproductive justice,” tweets Planned Parenthood Advocates of Indiana and Kentucky. “#StandWithCharlottesville against racism & hate in your community”:“Planned Parenthood stands against white supremacy & racism,” tweets Planned Parenthood Action Fund:“In order for our country to live up to its promise and democratic values, bigotry of all kinds must be rejected,” the abortion vendor continues. “We must not only condemn these actions, but also work relentlessly and collectively to put an end to white supremacy”:These are words from an organization that was founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger – whose bust and images are still celebrated in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery (NPG), despite acallby a national group of black ministers to have them removed.In a letter to the gallery’s director two years ago, Ministers Taking a Stand wrote:Perhaps the Gallery is unaware that Ms. Sanger supported black eugenics, a racist attitude toward black and other minority babies; an elitist attitude toward those she regarded as “the feeble minded;” speaking at rallies of Ku Klux Klan women; and communications with Hitler sympathizers. Also, the notorious “Negro Project” which sought to limit, if not eliminate, black births, was her brainchild. Despite these well-documented facts of history, her bust sits proudly in your gallery as a hero of justice. The obvious incongruity is staggering!Perhaps your institution is a victim of propaganda advanced by those who support abortion. Nevertheless, a prestigious institution like the National Portrait Gallery should have higher standards and subject its honorees to higher scrutiny…Like Hitler, Sanger advocated eugenics – the extermination of people she deemed “undesirables.” Finding that the American people rejected that idea, she then switched to birth control as a way of controlling the population growth of black people and others.In an interview with Breitbart News at the time,Bishop E.W. Jacksonof S.T.A.N.D. said his group received a response from the NPG, which referred to Sanger as a person who struggled for justice because she tried to make birth control and reproductive freedom available to poor women.“We responded back that this was not Sanger’s motivation,” Jackson asserts. “Her motivation was stopping people whom she considered ‘defective’ from having what she would call ‘defective children.’”“She thought that black people needed to be stopped from propagating and growing their population, and other people she called ‘feeble-minded,’” he adds. “And the analogy I drew is that’s like saying, ‘Hitler might have been controversial, but at least he helped population control.’”Jackson said it is “outrageous” that Sanger is held in high esteem.“We will not rest until it’s taken down,” he asserts. “We want to make sure that everybody in America knows who Margaret Sanger actually was. We think that will put Planned Parenthood and what they do in the proper perspective and I hope this will be one more nail in the coffin of Planned Parenthood.”Ryan Bomberger, chief creative officer of The Radiance Foundation, also told Breitbart News, “Museums educate the public about history. The NPG, however, wants to create a dangerous and fictionalized version of it.”“Planned Parenthood was born in eugenic racism and elitism, and Margaret Sanger was the mother who gave birth to the world’s largest abortion chain,” he continued. “In the city where Planned Parenthood began, more black babies are aborted than born alive according to the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. This is not the result of justice. It’s the result of animus.”Regarding the notion that the institutional left upholds Planned Parenthood, founded by a racist, yet cites racism as the downfall of the United States, Bomberger added, “Liberals find racism in every institution of American life, except in theoneindustry that kills for a living.”“Abortion is the number one killer in the black community (363,705 abortions versus 285,522 deaths from all causes of death combined),” he added. “Yet the propagandistic and hypocritical #BlackLivesMatter movement leadership stands with Planned Parenthood, proving that onlysomeblack lives matter.”Last November, singer and TV personality Nick CannonsaidPlanned Parenthood inflicted “real genocide” on black Americans, laterassertingthe abortion provider was designed to “exterminate” black people.“When you talked about Margaret Sanger, all the people who follow eugenics. It was all about cleansing,” theAmerica’s Got Talenthost said of Planned Parenthood’s founder in an interview with DJ Vlad.“Margaret Sanger said that she wanted to exterminate the Negro race, and that she was going to use her organization as she founded to do so,” Cannon continued. “It was more about the sterilization and where it comes to actual ethnic cleansing — where they actually said we want to get rid of a class of people, a group of people. Seventy-five percent of them are all in the hood.”“They like to label ‘feeble-minded’ or ‘lower-class,’ that’s what they used in public. In private, they were talking about the black community,” Cannon said.Sanger’s organization – which now takes in more than $500 million in taxpayer funding annually – grew to perform over 300,000 abortions per year in the United States. According to the 2010 census, 79 percent of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities arelocatedwithin walking distance of black or Hispanic neighborhoods.About 59 million abortions have beenperformedin the country since the Supreme Court’sRoe v. Wadedecision in 1973, nearly 18 million of them on black babies. As Breitbart News hasreported, theAlan Guttmacher Institutealso provided data showing that about 30 percent of all abortions in the U.S. are performed on black women, with another 25 percent performed on Hispanic women.Baltimore Ravens tight end Ben Watson commented on Sanger’s bigotry in August.“I do know that blacks kind of represent a large portion of the abortions,” WatsontoldTurningPointFriends.org, “and I do know that honestly the whole idea with Planned Parenthood and [founder Margaret] Sanger in the past was to exterminate blacks, and it’s kind of ironic that it’s working.”Retired NFL Super Bowl champion Burgess Owens backed up Watson.“Sanger looked at blacks as ‘weeds,’” OwenstoldBreitbart News, adding that the NAACP was complicit in the decimation of the black community through abortion. He added, “The NAACP was not a black-run, black-originated organization. It was run by 21 white, socialist, atheist, Marxist Democrats. It was the antithesis of Rev. Martin Luther King Sr.’s community at that time, which was capitalist, Christian, very pro-life, and pro-America. So, these 21 white people began to put a message through to the black community that Democrats were good, liberalism was good, and they subscribed to the same philosophy that Margaret Sanger believed of blacks at that time.”Sanger, who began theNegro Projectin 1939 and worked to bring birth control to blacks in an effort to reduce their population, joined with elite and well known African Americans Mary McLeod Bethune, W.E.B. DuBois, and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Sr. The Negro Project was sold as a solution to poverty and high birth rates among the black community. At the same time Sanger promoted her theory of “eliminating the unfit,” she also condemned charitable organizations that she believed were elevating the very population that needed to be weeded out.“If you wonder why urban, young, black women are allowing themselves to be victimized by Planned Parenthood, look at BET [Black Entertainment Television], which is owned by very wealthy white Democrats,” Owens urged. “Look at the 15 years of messaging that has been gotten through to our urban black communities: anti-white, anti-police, anti-family, and pro-abortion.”“Forty percent of black babies have been given to the altar of abortion,” he observed. “In any other society, that would be considered genocide. Today, we put a nice name to it and, at the same time, have convinced our own mothers that their babies are no more than an inconvenience or a profit.”"

735375054,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2009/07/03/Democrat-Utopia-Nothing-More-Than-a-Fantasy,Democrat Utopia Nothing More Than a Fantasy,"Cap and Trade, the biggest tax increase in American History, sailed through Congress without anybody even bothering to read it. What will prove to be perhaps the biggest historical change to the American way of life seemed nothing more than a Congressional mouse click, the Terms of Service Agreement on a new software installation. What is it about Democrats that they have such trust in other Democrats?There was no debate, no discussion; in fact the bill wasn’t even finished when they started voting on it. Yet they all knew they would like everything in the bill, and rushed the vote. I’m somewhat envious of the common goal they all seem to share, but I’m also suspicious of why nobody bothered to read it. Granted it was fifteen hundred pages, Fourth of July recess, and the deposit on the Martha’s Vineyard cottage wasn’t refundable.I think there is also something else at work here: Democrats tend to have more faith in the system than they have in the individual. When President Reagan tried to close the Department of Education, he was considered to be against education. It’s not just spin, Democrats really think that way. They feel it’s important to keep the Department of Education, because without it, there will be no education. Without the Department of Health, we would all be sick; without the Department of Commerce, the economy would fold. Ditto for the FDA, the FCC, FAA, and the rest of the alphabet soup.I’ve been a fan of Rush Limbaugh for quite some time; he is an incredible source for information and salient points. Unfortunately, I can’t repeat anything I hear in front of Democrats, because once you do, your point is considered moot. It doesn’t matter if the statistic you quote comes from the Congressional Budget Office or the United Nations, if you say you’ve heard it on Rush Limbaugh, your point is dismissed, and the conversation is over. (Not only don’t Democrats want to listen to Rush, they don’t want to listen to anyone who admits to listening to Rush.) Yet, these same people claim to know everything about Rush. How is that possible?Democrats don’t have to listen to Rush, (or Fox News either) because there are other people charged with that task. Organizations like Media Matters do all the dirty work then translate it for all the Lefties. So they never have to soil their mind by exposing it to a contrary opinions, or risk being converted to Conservatism. (For some reason, people on the Left believe they are incredibly susceptible to brainwashing, so they feel it is better not to listen to anything contrary.)I assume the same thing happened with the energy bill. Like the trust they put on Media Matters to tell the truth about Rush, there are people in the Party they trust to read the bill. Since it had the Waxman-Markey brand on the label, Democrats knew there was nothing but good old-fashioned Marxism inside.There is nothing more secure to Democrats than a big bureaucracy–it makes them feel safe. Perhaps that’s why so many of them linger on in colleges longer than the average American. Inefficient bureaucracies and musty old buildings with union swept halls are warm fuzzy places for them.   These people are the kind that like being looked after–it is the natural state of the Left.They want to live under a huge bureaucracy that will direct their life, from the time they are born into a government hospital through their time in government schools, then punch the clock at a government job until a government appointed doctor gives them an assisted suicide. A Democrat Utopia would be like a human zoo where the lions are kept separate from the zebras, every one is fed, and the doctor comes round once a year. Just keep re-electing Democrats who will insure the air is clean, your food is safe, your retirement is secure, and the tithe is paid.That’s a big one. When you decide to become a Democrat, the need for you to ever contribute to charity is completely eliminated. Every election cycle Democrat candidates are exposed for being skinflints when the 1040s are released. There is always a ridiculously small number on the lines of where charitable deductions are listed. The contribution is always so small you would think it was an accident, like they thought their $100 donation to the Breast Foundation was a subscription to a porn site.In actuality, I think they believe that membership in the Democrat Party is their donation to charity. The Party is their Church and the leaders are their clerics. Why should Al Gore give more than a couple hundred bucks to charitable causes when he has made his life work saving the earth from prosperity? (That could explain why so many of Obama’s appointees didn’t feel the need to pay taxes–churches are tax-exempt.)Never mind that Gore’s “charitable'” works have netted him billions. That’s just a bonus, and as most people like Gore will tell you, the nature of his job requires certain amenities. The Pope doesn’t fly coach either.I’ve yet to meet a public “servant” that didn’t whine about being underpaid and brag about how much more they could make in the private sector. Personally, I think it is the duty of Americans to help out these dedicated “servants” by removing them of their obligation and set them free to find their fortune.If you don’t want to read your assignments, it’s time to get a job. We need to make Democrats learn responsibility. Call it “tough love.” We need to lock the Democrats out of Government, the same way that a parent might eventually need to change the locks on the house while a 30-year-old child is at the Arcade. We need to tear down their posters, throw away the bongs, and put their X-boxes out on the back porch. Let’s turn the basement into an exercise room.Our next opportunity is coming in 2010."

I’ve ordered quite a few books off of Amazon, but the experience isn’t the same. When you go to a bookstore (for me at least) you’re motivated to do so for immediacy (I’m impatient when it’s a book I really want to read) and atmosphere. I hate to see any store, indie or chain, close, but as a capitalist, that’s how the market breathes. Besides, I can always take my books to a cafe.– One year later and yep,AOL/Huffington Post merger still as much of a failureas it was on day one."

Tabling the bill makes it possible for the legislature to pick it up and pass it again at any time, a concern many protesters expressed.“Facing such public rage, Carrie Lam simply makes apology through a press release, for ‘the inadequate work of the government’ but not for pushing to pass the bill or police’s crackdown on protesters,” the groupsaidin their response. “She even stressed that she would continue to serve the citizens.

No Shoot! No extradition to China.” Protesters also held flowers and, once the sun fell, candles in his honor.Policeidentifiedthe man only as “Leung” and ruled his death a suicide.The CHRF’s official figure for the protests was “almost two million plus one,” including Leung.Hong Kong is part of China under a policy called “one country, two systems,” which, in theory, allows Hong Kong to remain free of Communist Party rule but China to use its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to protect from foreign invasion. Protesters, a million of which gathered last week when Lam vowed nothing would stop the extradition bill, expressed concern that such a law would bring communist rule to Hong Kong and crush the city’s longstanding liberal democracy.The extradition bill, if passed, would require Hong Kong to extradite individuals indicted on charges of breaking Chinese Communist law. China severely restricts freedom of speech and religion and considers government criticism and private worship crimes. Student protesters, for example, have expressed worries that they could be arrested and extradited if they criticized the Communist Party in a college classroom.

7062940600,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2013/12/06/breitbart-news-requests-time-magazine-retract-schweizer-fact-check/,Breitbart News Requests Time Magazine Retract Schweizer 'Fact Check',"On Friday,Time Magazinestaff writer Kate Pickertpublished what she described in the title as a “fact check”of Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer’s reporting on the number of times President Barack Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary met in the three-plus years between the passage of the Affordable Care Act and November 30 of this year. Pickert claims to have debunked Schweizer’s reporting that showed the two met only once.But Pickert’s evidence countering Schweizer’s exhaustive reporting involves only her belief in what Joanne Peters, an Obama administration spokesperson, told her:The problem? Sebelius and the President did meet– a lot. “She is frequently at the White House for meetings related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including dozens with the President in the last year alone,” says Joanne Peters, a  spokeswoman for HHS. “In fact, she met with the President just yesterday.”Pickert then adds her opinion that…The problem with Schweizer’s analysis is his data set: Cabinet Secretaries who regularly come to the White House are not always recorded in the White House visitors log or listed on the president’s public schedule.To start with, what is missing from Pickert’s “fact check” is reporting and/or any effort involving independent verification of a statement from a government spokesperson. If Pickert chooses to believe what her government told her, that is up to her. But passing along as fact a statement from the government without any reporting to back it up does not rise to the level of a fact check.Reporting should start with government statements, not end with them.Finally, what Pickert fails to mention, or failed to research in Schweizer’s reporting, is thathe did directly address the issue of Cabinet Secretaries and the visitors log:When asked whether the nonpartisan GAI report shows a deficiency in Obama’s “leadership skills” during his White House press briefing, Carney alleged that “cabinet secretaries don’t regularly get entered into the visitor’s logs” and alleged that Obama meets “frequently” and “regularly” with Sebelius.As Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer noted on Fox News’s Hannity on Wednesday, though, GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was, though, “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”BecauseTime Magazineand Kate Pickert have not engaged in any reporting, and apparently put no effort into independently verifying a government spokesperson pushing back on a negative story, we see no facts that in any way refute Schweizer’s reporting.Because it is misleading to readers, we respectfully requestTime Magazineand Kate Pickert retract the dissemination of a statement from the government as a “fact check.”"

In the process, they will continue to ignore the awful history of the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).With their goal of protecting the JCPOA as part of President Obama’s legacy, mainstream media have already downplayed past and recent violations and provocations by Iran. As late as October 2016, there were multiple cruise missileattacks against U.S. Navy warshipsin the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. To date, the Obama administration has made no demand that Iran cease arming those rebels. The U.S. Navy retaliation against the Houthis that ultimately occurred was tepid and in no way impeded them from further attacks.As a retired Navy flag officer who was solicited, briefed, and persuaded by our national security leadership to support the nuclear deal with Iran, I am now appalled by the Obama administration’s incompetent implementation. Not only have we failed to demand compliance with the terms of that deal, not only have our warships been attacked by Iranian missiles fired by Iran’s proxy forces, we are constantly harassed by Iranian boats in the Strait of Hormuz to the point of forcing a U.S. Navy destroyer to firewarning shots.The theme of the nuclear deal, as it was briefed to me, was that there would be routine and rigorous verification, validation, inspection, and “snapback” protocols at the ready to ensure Iran’s compliance if they infringed or breached the deal — including the use of military force. I have lost all confidence in those assurances. What has become evident is that the snapback protocols have no teeth and, for the most part, must be coordinated with the UN Security council through UN Resolution 2112 before implementation.Meanwhile, Tehran’s mullahs display a total lack of respect for the intent of the nuclear deal or for compliance with its terms. Iran continues its “Death to America” rhetoric, its aggressive behavior, and its egregious provocations in Yemen, the Middle East and elsewhere. There has never been a hint from Washington that there will be any substantial punitive consequences for Iran’s many violations of the deal.In fact, even after receiving as much as $10 billion dollars insecret transfersby the Obama administration of gold and currency, Iran has the audacity to claim the United States is in breach of the agreement and should give them even more money! Through it all, Iran brazenly continues it nuclear program andICBM developmentin unchallenged defiance of UN sanctions.Additionally, Iran has announced it will build nuclear-powered ships, including submarines that will requireenriching uraniumto between 5% and 90%. Unsaid in that announcement is that Uranium enriched to 90% is at the threshold of the level needed for nuclear weapons, and that enriching beyond 4% is already in breach of the nuclear agreement. President Obama’s State Department’s initial response was to ignore the announcement, and then to deny that such a program would be in breach of the JCPOA nuclear deal.The passionate viewpoint I now have about how JCPOA is being executed is based on the blatant lies I was told by our current administration as they seduced support from Flag and General Officers. The sound bites presented at the time were compelling, but are revealed today for what they are by the subsequent facts and events: Iran never signed the JCPOA agreement without objection by the U.S. or any other signatory; we relinquished control of the “snapback” protocols to the United Nations under Resolution 2112; we’ve had our Navy attacked by Iranian missiles on the high seas; we’ve released vast sums of frozen money and have secretly paid Iran$700 million every monthafter Iran’s agreement to the deal. And still Iran accuses the United States of reneging on thebanking termsof the JCPOA?When the nuclear deal with Iran ultimately collapses, and it will, the mainstream media and former members of the Obama administration will blame president-elect Trump for its failure.As an original supporter of JCPOA, I unconditionally withdraw my sponsorship and look forward to the new administration’s immediate enforcement of that dangerously flawed and abysmally executed agreement.Edward “Sonny” Masso is a retired Rear Admiral and a career Surface Warfare Officer.

7050704260,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/07/03/rebuilding-the-american-civic-traditions-on-the-4th-of-july/,Rebuilding American Civic Traditions on the 4th of July,"Americans celebrate the 4th of July with fireworks, barbecues, picnics and all other kinds of enjoyable festivities. It’s wonderful that we live in a free country and are able to enjoy the fruits of our prosperity and freedom. However,merelywearing red,white, and blue, shirts with bald eagles on them, and other patriotic symbols is only a superficial way to celebrate America’s hard-fought for independence.On top of the enjoyable celebrations of America’s birth, some time should be dedicated each Independence Day to recognizing and coming to a better understanding of the noble traditions that we have inherited from the founders. The sacred torch of liberty is a precious gift that has been passed down by generations of Americans, it is our duty to keep it alive and pass it on to the next.On July 5, 1926, the 150th anniversary of the birth of our country, President Calvin Coolidgedelivered an addressat Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Coolidge spoke about the causes of the Revolution and the curtailment of rights that occurred at the hands of the British government. He explained how in separating from the British, America created a new government, with new principles; a far more profound act than than simply creating a new country out of the ashes of the old.“It was not because it was proposed to establish a new nation, but because it was proposed to establish a nation on new principles, that July 4, 1776, has come to be regarded as one of the greatest days in history,” Coolidge said. He described the origins of American institutions as grounded in Western philosophy and in the American colonial experience. He spoke about how the timeless truths and rights “endowed by our creator,” articulated so eloquently in the Declaration, became cemented by the wise construction of the Constitution.Coolidge said that the Constitution was created, “to establish a free government, which must not be permitted to degenerate into the unrestrained authority of a mere majority or the unbridled weight of a mere influential few,” he continued. “They undertook to balance these interests against each other and provide the three separate independent branches, the executive, the legislative, and the judicial departments of the Government, with checks against each other in order that neither one might encroach upon the other. These are our guarantees of liberty.”Finally, Coolidge stressed how America must not fall into the trap of pure materialism, how the grand Declaration came from the “influence of a great spiritual development.”Coolidge concluded:No other theory is adequate to explain or comprehend the Declaration of Independence. It is the product of the spiritual insight of the people. We live in an age of science and of abounding accumulation of material things. These did not create our Declaration. Our Declaration created them. The things of the spirit come first. Unless we cling to that, all our material prosperity, overwhelming though it may appear, will turn to a barren scepter in our grasp.If we are to maintain the great heritage which has been bequeathed to us, we must be like-minded as the fathers who created it. We must not sink into a pagan materialism. We must cultivate the reverence which they had for the things that are holy. We must follow the spiritual and moral leadership which they showed. We must keep replenished, that they may glow with a more compelling flame, the altar fires before which they worshiped.Many Americans may have lost sight of the timeless truths and great principles that Coolidge described, but those who still believe that the American heritage of liberty should endure and be passed on must create conventions to keep their country’s founding ideals alive in the modern era.Radio host Dennis Pragerhas writtenabout how “America Needs a July Fourth Seder.” Much like how Jews pass down their religion and history through annual reflection and discussion during Passover, Americans who believe in the country created by the founders should read foundational texts to their friends and family while discussing the ideas that made it exceptional. Even a brief, 10-minute exercise looking back on where we came from as a people prevents the pure trivialization of an extraordinarily important holiday.But there are other ways of honoring America on the 4th as well. I personally make a pilgrimage to George Washington’s home at Mount Vernon to place flowers by the Father of Our Country’s grave. Every year, I reflect on Washington’s virtue and fundamental belief in the cause of the Revolution; I find that my annual tradition deepens my appreciation of the man and the founding generation’s greatness, and enhances the meaning of the holiday for me.Historian Richard Brookhiser wrote inFounding Father: Rediscovering George Washington, “When Washington lived he had the ability to give strength to debaters and to dying men. His life still has the power to inspire anyone who studies it.” In dark times, such as the circumstances American find themselves in today, it is a comfort and inspiration to reflect on the life of a man who endured through some of the darkest in our country’s history and triumphed.American civic institutions, cultural heritage, and principles are under attack. If they continue to muddle in perpetual decline, and if we fail to pass them on to the next generation, then a more secure border, temporary policy victories, and better elected representatives will amount to very little. The American republic was built on principles and ideas, not ethnicity, and it will not survive unless there are future generations ready to forcefully articulate what those ideas are and what the purpose is of our grand experiment in liberty. That is why on the anniversary of American independence, it is so important to spend some time reminding ourselves of the great task before us: to honor, preserve, and perpetuate the great American tradition.Follow Jarrett Stepman on Twitter:@JarrettStepman.

4967918523,http://www.breitbart.com/news/shock-video-shows-black-motorist-shot-dead-by-us-police/,Shock video shows black motorist shot dead by US police,"Minneapolis (AFP) – A black motorist was shot at close range and seen bleeding to death in a distressingly graphic video viewed online by two million people Thursday, the second case of racism-tinged police violence to rock America in as many days.A four-year-old girl witnessed the shooting of Philando Castile from the back seat of the car in a town near Minneapolis, Minnesota on Wednesday, as her mother — the victim’s girlfriend — livestreamed the shocking scene.“Oh my God, please don’t tell me he’s dead, please don’t tell me my boyfriend just went like that…,” the woman, identified on her Facebook page as Lavish Reynolds and also known as “Diamond,” is heard telling a police officer pointing a gun through the car window.“You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir.”Pulled over apparently for a broken tail light, Castile had informed the officer that he was carrying a licensed gun, according to his girlfriend’s filmed account.In the background, an officer is heard shouting: “I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hands up.”Shocked family members immediately demanded justice for the 32-year-old Castile, a school cafeteria worker, whose mother described him as a law-abiding citizen who kept out of trouble.“I think he was just black in the wrong place,” Valerie Castile told CNN. “Every day you hear of another black person being shot down, gunned down by the people that are supposed to protect us.”A day earlier, a black father of five died in another police shooting captured on video, that time in Louisiana. Alton Sterling was pinned to the ground and shot several times at point blank range, prompting the launch of a federal civil rights investigation.“We’re being hunted every day. It’s a silent war against African-American people as a whole,” Castile said.– 10-minute video –America’s debate on police use of lethal force, especially against young black men, is set to hit fever pitch — as a fourth officer goes to trial Thursday in one of the highest-profile such cases of recent years.Three officers so far have escaped conviction in the case of Freddie Gray, a young black man who died last year in Baltimore after suffering spinal injuries in the back of a police van.Police said the Minnesota incident was being investigated and a handgun was recovered at the scene.Philando Castile’s girlfriend — clearly in shock — methodically narrates the shooting incident in the 10-minute video as officers can be heard shouting and swearing in the background.She starts wailing as it becomes clear Castile is dying.Castile can be seen in the driver seat, large blood stains spreading through his white shirt. He was later taken to hospital and pronounced dead.“They didn’t let me see my son’s body, at all,” Valerie Castile said on CNN.– Civil rights probe –In both the Minnesota and Louisiana cases, the victims had a gun in their possession, though there is no indication they pointed their weapon at police at any time.A peaceful crowd of a hundred people kept vigil through the night outside the Baton Rouge convenience store where Sterling was shot.A mural depicting the 37-year-old has been painted on the side of the Triple S Mart store.“I’m so outraged,” prayer memorial organizer Keon Preston told The Advocate newspaper.In the Louisiana case, police said they intervened after an anonymous caller told police they had been threatened by a man with a gun.Sterling’s family lawyer said he was merely selling CDs outside the store, with the permission of its owner.Officials appealed for calm after protesters took to the streets in the aftermath of Tuesday’s shooting, promising a fully transparent investigation.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said federal authorities would take over the probe, led by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.“I have very serious concerns,” Edwards told a news conference in Baton Rouge. “The video is disturbing to say the least.”The two officers involved, Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II, have been placed on administrative leave, pending the results of the investigation."

5393939931,http://www.breitbart.com/news/turkey-policeman-assassinates-russia-envoy-at-art-show/,Turkey policeman assassinates Russia envoy at art show,"Ankara (AFP) – A Turkish policeman crying “Aleppo” and “Allahu Akbar” shot dead Russia’s ambassador to Turkey at an art exhibition in Ankara on Monday, in what Moscow branded a “terrorist act” that would be punished.Andrei Karlov died of his wounds after the shooting, which occurred on the eve of a key meeting between the Russian, Turkish and Iranian foreign ministers on the Syria conflict.Dramatic television footage showed the moment the veteran diplomat was shot as he opened a show of Russian photographs at the Ankara exhibition hall.Images showed the ambassador standing up to speak at a lectern, before stumbling and crashing to the ground, lying flat on his back as the attacker — dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and tie — brandishes his gun at terrified onlookers.The man shouts “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”) and then talks about pledging allegiance to jihad in Arabic, the images showed.Switching to Turkish, he then says: “Don’t forget about Syria, don’t forget about Aleppo. All those who participate in this tyranny will be held accountable”.The state-run Anadolu news agency said the gunman had been “neutralised” in a police operation inside the hall after 15 minutes of clashes.Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu identified the attacker as Mevlut Mert Altintas, 22, who had worked in the Ankara anti-riot police for the last two-and-a-half years.“Today in Ankara as a result of an attack the Russian ambassador to Turkey Andrei Karlov received wounds that he died from,” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in televised comments.“We qualify what happened as a terrorist act,” she added. “The murderers will be punished.”“Today this issue will be raised at the UN Security Council. Terrorism will not win out.”– ‘Baying for blood’ –The incident came after days of protests in Turkey over Russia’s role in Syria, although Moscow and Ankara are now working closely together to evacuate citizens from the battered city of Aleppo.The United States condemned the attack, while British ambassador Richard Moore paid tribute to a “quietly spoken, hospitable professional.”Erdogan phoned Putin to brief him about the attack, presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said.James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank in London, said Moscow will use the attack to step up actions in what the Kremlin sees as a “war on terror”.“My sense it that the Russians won’t blame the Turks for this but will seek to capitalise on it for wider gains,” he said.“Clearly the Russian military will be baying for blood, they’ll want revenge.”Turkey vowed it would not allow the assassination to damage relations with Moscow, which have dramatically improved in recent months.“We will not allow this attack to cast a shadow on Turkey-Russia relations,” said the Turkish foreign ministry in a statement.Interior minister Soylu said the killing was “a terror attack on relations between Russia and Turkey”.The shooting took place at the Cagdas Sanatlar Merkezi, a major art exhibition hall in the Cankaya district of Ankara where most foreign embassies are located, including Russia’s mission.“When the ambassador was delivering a speech, a tall man wearing a suit, fired into the air first and then took aim at the ambassador,” Hurriyet correspondent Hasim Kilic, who was at the scene, told AFP.“He said something about Aleppo and ‘revenge’. He ordered the civilians to leave the room. When people were fleeing, he fired again.”– ‘Crucial meeting’ –Protesters in Turkey have held Moscow responsible for human rights violations in Aleppo with thousands turning out for protests outside the Russian consulate in Istanbul.Turkey and Russia saw relations plunge to their worst levels since the Cold War last year when a Turkish jet shot down a Russian war plane over Syria.They stand on opposite sides of the Syria conflict with Ankara backing rebels trying to topple Moscow’s ally President Bashar al-Assad.But the rhetoric has warmed considerably since a reconciliation deal was signed earlier this year and a Russian and Turkish-brokered accord has helped the evacuation of citizens from Aleppo in the last days.The attack came a day before the Turkish, Russian and Iranian foreign ministers were to hold unprecedented three-way talks on the Syria conflict in Moscow.The Syrian foreign ministry in Damascus denounced the murder as a “despicable crime”, state news agency SANA said.Cavusoglu learned of the news while on the plane to Moscow and the meeting would go ahead as planned, Turkish officials said.Born in 1954 in Moscow, Karlov was a career diplomat who had began his career under the USSR in 1976. He was Russian ambassador to North Korea from 2001-2006."
6948592171,https://www.breitbart.com/news/s-korean-minister-proposes-us-n-korea-tradeoff/,S.Korean minister proposes US-N.Korea tradeoff,"Washington (AFP) – An end to the Korean War in return for the verified dismantling of its major North Korean nuclear facility: South Korea’s foreign minister on Wednesday proposed this tradeoff to unblock stalled negotiations between the United States and North Korea.North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump held a groundbreaking summit in Singapore in June, where they reached a vague agreement to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, but there has been little movement since.The North, which is under United Nations sanctions, has carried out six nuclear tests and says it has missiles that can hit the United States.“What North Korea has indicated is they will permanently dismantle their nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, which is a very big part of their nuclear program,” Seoul’s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said in an interview with The Washington Post.Her comments came ahead of a visit on Sunday by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to North Korea, where he will meet strongman Kim Jong Un in an effort to further the denuclearization effort.During a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in September, Kim expressed his readiness to close the Yongbyon facility, which is capable of uranium enrichment, if Washington took “corresponding measures.”“If they do that in return for America’s corresponding measures, such as the end-of-war declaration, I think that’s a huge step forward for denuclearization,” Kang told the Post.Trump, who has sounded optimistic about holding a second summit with Kim, has not ruled out declaring an end to the 1950-1953 war, which concluded only with an armistice.Pompeo has refused to comment on the declaration option.Referring to a previous verification effort in 2008, Kang said that demanding an inventory of North Korea’s nuclear assets risks, at this stage, derailing the process.“I think the last time things broke down precisely as we were working out a detailed protocol on verification after we had gotten the list,” she said.“We want to take a different approach,” she said.“We will have to see an inventory at some point, but that some point can be reached more expeditiously by action and corresponding measures that give the two sides sufficient trust.”At the same time, she dismissed fears of those who think that a formal end to the war will open the door to US disengagement from South Korea, where it bases around 30,000 troops.Kang told the Post that a declaration would be a purely “political” document and “not a legally binding treaty.”"

Gary McAllister when he came here, for one.“I can understand the policy that everyone wants young, bright, British players – but I don’t agree 100 percent that that should be the only way.“I learned bucket loads from Gary McAllister.”Liverpool are not the only club who have focused on youth this term, with Chelsea yet to offer new deals to veterans Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, while Aston Villa’s fight against relegation is being undertaken with a vastly inexperienced squad.“The main example at the moment is if Chelsea don’t keep Frank Lampard. Someone is going to get a bargain. What is he, 34?” Gerrard said.“It’s not my business what Chelsea do but if they don’t renew Frank’s contract someone else is going to get a really good player for a few years.“I look at Aston Villa now and the majority of them are going to be fantastic players in time but, in my opinion, that team needs two or three old heads to guide them. To be successful at this level you need to get the mix right.”Gerrard and his young Liverpool team-mates will get a close-up look at the value of experience on Sunday when they travel to Old Trafford to take on a Manchester United team still driven by Paul Scholes, 39, and 38-year-old Ryan Giggs.Even Robin van Persie, by far the Premier League’s most influential player in the first half of this season, is already 29. But that didn’t stop United manager Alex Ferguson paying  £24 million to sign him from Arsenal.It is a policy Gerrard agrees with. “Once these players are long gone I think they’ll be appreciated even more. It’ll be a bit similar at United when Scholes and Giggs eventually move on,” he said.“That’s why Alex Ferguson is holding onto them. If someone of his calibre, who has done what he’s done in the game and with his knowledge, knows how important it is to keep hold of those players, that tells you how important experience and top pros are.”"

919611000,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA2E2C800,Claims about flood-damaged cars aren't true,"(AP) Claims about flood-damaged cars aren’t trueBy TOM KRISHERAP Auto WriterDETROITIn the days since Superstorm Sandy, an alarming prediction has flashed across the Internet: Hundreds of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles will inundate the nation’s used-car market, and buyers might not be told which cars have been ruined.Not true, according to insurance-claims data reviewed by The Associated Press. The actual number of affected vehicles is far smaller, and some of those cars will be repaired and kept by their owners. The dire predictions are being spread by a company that sells vehicle title and repair histories and by the largest group representing American car dealers.They claim the number of cars marred by Sandy could be larger than when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005 and damaged more than 600,000 vehicles. But an AP analysis of claims data supplied by major insurance companies shows the total number of damaged cars is a fraction of that.The companies _ State Farm, Progressive, New Jersey Manufacturers and Nationwide _ have received about 31,000 car-damage claims.“It’s not anything near what we’re talking about in the Katrina situation,” said James Appleton, president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, a statewide association of more than 500 dealers.Frank Scafidi, a spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an insurance company group that monitors fraud and other trends, concurred, saying insurers monitored by his group are logging far fewer claims than they did with Katrina.“It doesn’t translate to there’s going to be 2, 3, 400,000 cars out of this thing just because this is such a huge geographic storm,” Scafidi said.Because many communities are still cleaning up from the superstorm, more claims are bound to come in. But 10 days after Sandy, the rate is already starting to slow. And many of these cars will have relatively minor damage unrelated to water. They’ll be fixed and returned to their owners.About 14,000 new cars were also damaged by Sandy while they sat on docks in the New York area awaiting shipment to dealers. But most of those vehicles won’t end up on sales lots. Automakers will have severely damaged cars crushed because they don’t want their brand name hurt by substandard vehicles circulating in the marketplace.To be sure, flood-damaged cars can be a serious problem. Once a vehicle is dried out, the damage may not be immediately apparent, so the car can often be sold to an unsuspecting buyer.Beneath the surface, the water can damage computers that control everything from the gas pedal to the entertainment system. Saltwater, like that from Sandy’s storm surge, is especially harmful, causing corrosion in electrical and mechanical parts that can pose problems for years.Companies like Carfax, a Centreville, Va., provider of vehicle-history reports, stand to benefit if more buyers are worried about the risk of purchasing a flooded car. The company charges $39.99 for a single report, although it also contracts with dealers and manufacturers, so many reports cost less. About 170 million reports are viewed each year.Carfax, a privately held subsidiary of the R.L. Polk & Co. automotive data firm, put out a news release Tuesday speculating that Sandy’s toll on cars would exceed the damage left by Katrina.In an interview, company spokesman Larry Gamache said early indications were that more vehicles could have been damaged in the densely populated Northeast than were damaged by Katrina in 2005 along the more sparsely populated Gulf Coast. He estimated that half of them, more than 300,000, would find their way back onto the market as used cars.“I think it’s partly due to the breadth of the storm and the intensity of the storm and where the storm hit,” Gamache said.A spokeswoman for Experian, which runs a Carfax competitor called AutoCheck, said the area that got blasted by Sandy has 9 million registered cars, far more than in the Gulf region struck by Katrina.On Wednesday, the National Automobile Dealers Association put out a statement estimating that 200,000 or more flooded cars could be resold as used.The trade organization warned that the storm could crimp the supply of clean used cars, potentially driving up prices. But its estimate was based on reports from third parties that showed 600,000 cars were damaged in Katrina and that Sandy would cause about one-third of the dollar damage from Katrina.“There was not an incredible amount of science behind it,” conceded Jonathan Banks, executive automotive analyst with the NADA Used Car Guide.Katrina overwhelmed low-lying areas of the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, which is below sea level, causing widespread flooding. Many people in Katrina’s path didn’t evacuate, and car dealers didn’t have many options to protect inventories.In hard-hit New Jersey, flooding from Sandy was mainly confined to a strip along the coast from Atlantic City to New York, and most people evacuated those areas, Appleton said.In the western part of the state, “unless a tree fell on your car, your car wasn’t even at risk,” he said.Chris Basso, another Carfax spokesman, said the company relied on an estimate from a trusted industry source in putting out its news release. He said it was just an estimate, and the final number won’t be known for a while.“All we’re trying to do is make sure people are looking out for these cars,” he said. “Because eventually they’re going to make their way back onto the road.”Regardless of the predictions, thousands of flood-damaged cars will certainly be resold, and buyers need to be cautious.Unlike the automakers who destroy badly damaged inventory, dealers, insurance companies and others often resell flooded cars to recoup their losses.If the cars were declared total losses by insurance companies, states require them to get new titles branding them as flood-damaged vehicles. But some sellers don’t disclose that, and some even move the cars from state to state to wash the branding off the titles.So even if the numbers are far smaller than the estimates, anyone buying a used car in the coming months should check the title and repair history and have the car inspected by a mechanic. Buyers can also do their own inspection, sniffing for musty odors and checking for mud and debris under the dashboard.“People just have to be a little smart about this,” said Scafidi, of the insurance company group. But he added, “We don’t want to sit here and say the sky is falling.”___Seven tips for avoiding a flood-damaged car:_ Run the car’s vehicle identification number through Carfax at http://www.carfax.com, AutoCheck at http://www.autocheck.com, or VinCheck at http://www.nicb.org/theft_and_fraud_awareness/vincheck. The services can usually tell you if a car’s been damaged or if it’s been totaled by an insurance company._ Have the car inspected by a mechanic, who can put it on a lift and check the undercarriage for water damage or debris from flood waters._ Check the interior yourself for signs of water damage. Sniff for a musty smell. Look for signs of freshly shampooed carpet. Check under the floorboard carpet for water residue, rust, or water stain marks. Look under the dashboard for dried mud or other flood residue. Check for rust on screws in the console and other areas where water wouldn’t normally be present._ Check the trunk for moldy smells, water stains, rust or debris._ Look under the hood for mud or grit in the alternator, behind wires and around small openings in starter motors and power steering pumps._ Follow wires to check for signs of rust, water residue or corrosion._ Check the undercarriage for evidence of rust or flaking metal that wouldn’t normally be on newer vehicles.___Source: National Automobile Dealers Association"

We must prepare very well to have a good Christmas.”There were also wins for Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s 88th-minute strike earned Manchester United a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace.Chelsea, for whom Eden Hazard missed out due to a knock, have won all 10 league games they gave played since losing 3-0 at Arsenal on September 24, keeping eight clean sheets.But it took a flying save from goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to prevent Patrick van Aanholt snatching a point for bottom club Sunderland at the death.Conte’s men are six points clear of Liverpool, who stole above Arsenal into second place courtesy of a 3-0 win at Middlesbrough in which Adam Lallana scored twice.Having seen his side beaten 4-3 at Bournemouth and then held to a 2-2 draw by West Ham United, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp dropped goalkeeper Lorus Karius for Simon Mignolet.His team went ahead in the 29th minute when Lallana headed in from England team-mate Nathaniel Clyne’s right-wing cross.Lallana teed up Divock Origi to add a second on the hour and eight minutes later the Belgian returned the favour as Lallana claimed his second goal.“About a year ago I had sat him in the office and I was happy with him, but he was like, ‘I’m not scoring,’” Klopp said of Lallana.“And I said he wasn’t in the right positions.

6153729546,http://www.breitbart.com/news/cat-5-hurricane-maria-threatens-storm-battered-caribbean/,Cat 5 Hurricane Maria threatens storm-battered Caribbean,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Hurricane Maria intensified into a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm Monday as it surged toward islands in the eastern Caribbean, and forecasters warned it might become even stronger.The storm’s eye was expected to pass near Dominica during the night and then on Tuesday brush past many of the islands already wrecked by Hurricane Irma and head toward a possible direct strike on Puerto Rico on Wednesday.On Dominica, zinc roofs began blowing off homes as the outer edge of the storm moved in during the evening.Authorities had closed schools and government offices on the island and urged people to move from dangerous areas to shelters.“We should treat the approaching hurricane very, very seriously,” Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit warned. “This much water in Dominica is dangerous.”In August 2015, Tropical Storm Erika unleashed flooding and landslides that killed 31 people and destroyed more than 370 homes on the small, mountainous island.Officials on nearby Guadeloupe said the French island would experience extremely heavy flooding and warned that many communities could be submerged overnight.In Martinique, authorities ordered people to remain indoors and said they should prepare for cuts to power and water. Schools and non-essential public services were closed.With Puerto Rico appearing destined for a hit, officials in the U.S. territory warned residents of wooden or otherwise flimsy homes to find safe shelter.“You have to evacuate. Otherwise you’re going to die,” said Hector Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s public safety commissioner. “I don’t know how to make this any clearer.”The U.S. territory imposed rationing of basic supplies including water, milk, baby formula, canned food, batteries and flashlights.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Maria had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) Monday evening. It was centered about 40 miles (70 kilometers) north of Martinique and 15 miles (25 kilometers) east-southeast of Dominica, and was heading west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).“Maria is developing the dreaded pinhole eye,” the center warned.That’s a sign of an extremely strong hurricane likely to get even mightier, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. Just like when a spinning ice skater brings in their arms and rotates faster, a smaller, tighter eye shows the same physics, he said.Maria’s eye shrank to a narrow 10 miles (16 kilometers) across.“You just don’t see those in weaker hurricanes,” McNoldy said.Hurricane warnings were posted for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat. A tropical storm warning was issued for Antigua and Barbuda, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Martinique and Anguilla.The storm’s hurricane-force winds extended about 25 miles (35 kilometers) from the eye, and tropical storm-force winds as far as 125 miles (205 kilometers).Forecasters said storm surge could raise water levels by 6 to 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) near Maria’s center. The storm was predicted to bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain for some islands, with the possibility of higher amounts in isolated spots.The current forecast track would carry it about 22 miles (35 kilometers) south of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands late Tuesday and early Wednesday, territorial Gov. Kenneth Mapp said.“We are going to have a very, very long night,” Mapp said as he urged people in the territory to finish any preparations.St. Thomas and St. John are still recovering from a direct hit by Hurricane Irma, which did extensive damage and caused four deaths on the two islands.Officials and islanders were also bracing in Puerto Rico, which did not take a direct hit from Irma but still saw blackouts across much of the territory. Nearly 70,000 people remain without power, and Gov. Ricardo Rossello warned of an island-wide outage.“This is going to be a catastrophic event,” he said.Forecasters said the storm would dump up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) of rain across Puerto Rico and whip the island with heavy winds for 12 to 24 hours.Officials said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was ready to bring drinking water and help restore power in Puerto Rico after the storm.Traffic was heavy Monday as people rushed to buy last-minute items. Among them was 70-year-old retiree Rafael Rivera, who clutched a small bag of dog treats for his dog and six puppies at home.“This storm is coming with some bad intentions,” he said at a San Juan store where some shoppers grumbled about empty shelves.Rossello said Puerto Rico had prepared 500 shelters capable of taking in up to 133,000 people in a worst-case scenario. Nearly 200 people are still in shelters due to Hurricane Irma. Classes were cancelled and government employees were to work only a half-day.Farther north, long-lived Hurricane Jose continued to head northward well away from the U.S. East Coast but causing dangerous surf and rip currents. It was not expected to make landfall, but a tropical storm warning was in effect for coastal areas in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Tropical storm watches were posted for parts of New York’s Long Island and Connecticut.Jose was centered about 230 miles (370 kilometers) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and was stationary. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph).Seawater washed over parts of North Carolina’s Outer Banks as Jose passed, and five people were knocked off a coastal jetty in Rhode Island by high surf caused by the storm. All five were hospitalized.___AP science writer Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report."
7112574176,https://www.breitbart.com/news/mourinho-misery-extends-uniteds-woes-in-post-ferguson-era/,Mourinho misery extends United’s woes in post-Ferguson era,"London (AFP) – Watching on at Anfield as Manchester United meekly surrendered 3-1 to Liverpool in what proved to be Jose Mourinho’s last match in charge, Alex Ferguson was caught shaking his head at the sight of what the empire he built has become.For the fourth time since Ferguson retired in 2013 after nearly 27 years in charge, with 13 Premier League titles under his belt, United are looking for a new manager.The volatile Mourinho was largely the author of his own downfall. He leaves the world’s richest club 19 points off the top of the Premier League and with an almighty struggle just to qualify for next season’s Champions League with a top-four finish.But his departure should sound alarm bells for United’s American owners, the Glazer family, as they struggle to find a manager capable of following in Ferguson’s footsteps.The fiery Scotsman signed off by winning the league. In the five years since, United have not even been in contention to win the title.Replacing one of the all-time greats was never going to be an easy task but even Ferguson, who also led United to two Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups, would never have dreamed it would prove such a poisoned chalice.As a fellow Glaswegian whose relative success on a limited budget at Everton evoked memories of Ferguson’s breakthrough years with Aberdeen, David Moyes apparently had the skillset and background to follow his compatriot’s template in Manchester.But after Ferguson anointed him as his hand-picked replacement, Moyes proved completely out of his depth and lasted just 10 months of his six-year contract.Moyes’s penchant for conservative tactics, dour training sessions and a lack of man-management skills might seem familiar to members of the current United squad, who grew sick of Mourinho’s acerbic personality.By the time United were ruled out of qualifying for the Champions League, the writing was on the wall for Moyes, whose sacking in April 2014 made his the shortest United managerial reign for 82 years.Autocratic Dutchman Louis van Gaal was also a poor fit despite his impressive pedigree with Barcelona and Ajax. His football was too one-paced and predictable for fans fed on Ferguson’s aggressive approach for so long.Returning United to the Champions League with a top-four finish in his first season bought Van Gaal some time, but the only standard that matters at Old Trafford is winning the title.When they laboured to a fifth place finish 12 months later, even United’s FA Cup final win against Crystal Palace was not enough to spare Van Gaal.– ‘Whole club needs resetting’ –Mourinho’s self-proclaimed status as a serial trophy winner made him the obvious choice to take a role he had long regarded as his dream job.But the siege mentality that helped Mourinho inspire his players to remarkable success at Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan was no longer such a convincing act for the pampered millionaires that inhabit the Old Trafford dressing room.Although Mourinho won the League Cup and Europa League in his first season, United finished a dismal sixth in the Premier League.It did not help that Mourinho’s dour game-plans in a trophy-less second season contrasted so sharply with Pep Guardiola’s stylish and successful Manchester City side, who romped to the title with a record 100 points.And at Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp has woken a sleeping giant and put them in contention for a first league title since 1990, adding defensive steel to attacking flair.Guardiola and Klopp were both on the market in the post-Ferguson era and passed United by.The club stated on Tuesday that time will be taken to find a successor, with a caretaker put in charge for the rest of the season.But there are concerns over who will make that decision, with the club increasingly obsessed with commercial interests rather than winning on the pitch.“There’s a multitude of issues, it’s more complex than the manager getting the best out of the players or not being backed. It’s a deep problem, it needs resetting, the whole club needs resetting,” said former United captain Gary Neville said on Sunday.“Five years ago, two huge figures (Ferguson and former chief executive David Gill) left that football club, two figures that had great knowledge of the game.“What happened was the financial and commercial people, that are fantastic at their jobs, were put in charge of the football side of things and they are not competent enough to do it.“They have to now hand it over to people that are good enough to run the football side of the club.”"

No other details have been released at this time.Extraordinary sceneswere witnessed at the Roszke-Horgos border crossing last night as 1500 migrants attempted to break through the country’s border fence. Hungarian police were forced to fire tear gas and water cannon as the rioters hurled missiles, including rocks and concrete, while chanting “allah hu akbar.”Gyorgy Bakondi, a security adviser to Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has told reporters that 20 police officers were injured in the violence. “Police also captured an identified terrorist,” Bakondi said without giving any more details,Reutershas reported.Hungary has been widely condemned for its actions in holding off the rioting masses. Montserrat Feixas Vihé, the UNHCR Regional Representative for Central Europe, told theTelegraph: “I think it is very sad to use violence against refugees.“It was pretty scary when hundreds of people are trying to get somewhere and the same number are trying to stop them. I just hope that things calm down. The police passed over two young Syrians and we are trying to reunite them with their parents. We have a lot of people here – we had 60 at the weekend – and also on the Serbian side.”He also criticised Hungary for not translating the charge sheets handed to migrants who are being prosecuted for entering the country illegally, saying: “The main problem is communication: we have offered to mediate here, and I hope the chief commander is taking that offer seriously. The refugees don’t know what to do, or where to go. The policy has been inconsistent. It is really important that there is a concerted effort to communicate.”Serbia’s Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic has also reacted angrily, calling on the EU to bring Hungary in line. Budapest must “behave in line with European standards”, he insisted, otherwise “we will find a way to protect our borders and European values as well.“We will not allow anyone to humiliate us. I call on the European Union to react, for its members to behave in line with European values.”Undeterred, Hungary has announced plans to extend the 110-mile fence line along its Serbian border. “We will also have to extend the fence to the Croatian border,” Mr Orban told German newspaperDie Welt.He added that, as the route the migrants take changes, new fences will have to be built to further deter them. Work has already begun on a new fence-line along sections of Hungary’sRomanian border; Orban suggested that similar work will be undertaken on the Croatian border in the near future.Yesterday Croatia announced that some5,650 migrantshad entered the country via Serbia in the last 24 hours alone, in a bid to avoid the fence. This morning a further 5,000 attempted to board trains to the Croatian capital of Zagreb from the small town of Tovarnik, less than a mile from the Serbian border.The Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusic last night said: “We are ready to [provide] asylum to a few thousand people and we can handle that, but we are not ready for tens of thousands. We do not have the capacity.”Follow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter:Follow @Donna_R_Eor e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com"
7067687096,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2016/12/24/eu-chief-borders-must-stay-open/,EU Chief: Borders Must Stay Open Despite Deadly Terror Attacks,"The best way to fight terror is with “openness”, European Union (EU) head Jean-Claude Juncker has said, stressing that Europe must continue to receive migrants in the wake of the deadly truck attack in Berlin.Speaking toFunke Mediengruppeon Saturday, the president of the European Commission warned that the “rhetoric of exclusion” strengthens terrorists, and called for more EU involvement in nations’ internal security.“Terror only takes us if we allow it”, he said of the attack on Monday, in which a Tunisian migrant ploughed a truck into people at a Christmas market killing 12 and injuring many more.Declaring that “the basic values for which the European Union stands remain unchanged”, Junckerinsistedthe continent “must continue to offer refuge to people who flee from war zones and from terror.”He added that it “would be wrong to put all refugees under suspicion”, stating “Hate and terror have no religion, no sex, no country of origin.”In an apparent swipe at populists in Europe who believe restricting mass migration from the Middle East and Africa would make the continent safer, Juncker said: “Anyone who pounces on the rhetoric of exclusion is helping the extremists’ way of thinking, which strengthens their spiral of hate.”“This neither creates solutions nor helps the victims and their relatives.”Standing firm on the idea that liberalism is the best response to repeated attacks on Europeans, the EU chief said: “Our values, our way of living together in freedom, coexistence, and openness are the best weapons against terror.”Juncker also noted that freedom of movement across the Schengen area is helpful to terrorists, but said the solution to this is a stronger EU, asserting that “national domestic policy alone is no longer sufficient.”“We must counter the terrorists’ hatred with the values of the population who want to live freely, openly and peacefully with each other. The people with whom I spoke after the attacks in Berlin, Paris, Nice, and Brussels stand for exactly this attitude.“They react in a prudent way – and expect to see this reflected in our politics as well,” he said.Politicians in Central and Eastern Europe have consistently taken a very different stance on Islamist terror attacks on European soil to their Western counterparts and EU elites.In June, Poland’s interior minister, Mariusz Blaszczak,blastedWestern Europe’s response to terror — holding marches and drawing pictures of flowers — as completely ineffective. He said multiculturalism, political correctness, and mass migration are responsible for terror attacks in Europe, and argued that governments should actually protect their citizens."

The measure was meant to emulatethe resolutionsUIC passed in the late 1980s to divest from apartheid-ridden South Africa, but instead of apartheid, this resolution aimed to attack Israel for its purported oppression of the Palestinians.After the resolution was introduced earlier this month, a trio of students, Chloe Schofield, Amitai Loew, and Moshe Rubin, jumped into action to change the focus of the document by shifting the resolution from one solely targeting Israel to a general, more watered down measure targeting practically any nation supposedly perpetrating human rights violations.Operating under the moniker Coalition for Peace, the anti-BDS students were able to insert sections into the resolution that condemn purported human rights violations by the U.S., Britain, China, Syria, and other nations in order to take the focus off Israel.“Without a doubt, the original document was blatantly pointed at Israel. Myself and another student were able to get the original writers of the resolution to come to a meeting with USG members and a member of the administration where we discussed the Jewish and Pro-Israel communities’ concerns about the resolution, and heavily edited it to not single out Israel, make no mention of the BDS movement, and focus it on the core qualities I outlined above,”Amitai Loewtold theWashington Free Beacon.Chloe Schofield agreed, telling Breitbart News that their aim was to make the resolution more fair to the whole of UIC’s student body and not just an attack on Jewish students. The original resolution, Schofield said, “unfairly targeted Israel and would undoubtedly affect Jewish students in a significant way.”Schofield said she noted to the student group that the resolution unfairly excluded the purported human rights violations of many other countries and was then asked to submit revisions to the document.“What we ended up with after a lot of work,” Schofield told Breitbart News, “was a resolution that no longer singled out Israel, and by association Jewish students, and instead asked for the university to review its mutual funds and be more financially transparent. ”Schofield also noted that putting the U.S. in the resolution was less an attack on America and more a means to ameliorate the original attack solely on Israel making the final document “fairer and more accessible to all UIC students.”“Putting the U.S. in that resolution made it clear that this resolution could only be a symbolic gesture to ask the board of trustees to be more transparent in their investments, not a force to fuel anti-Semitic rhetoric,” she said.Still, the meeting was fraught with heated rhetoric and at one point anti-Israel chants filled the room, causing the Jewish students to ask the university police department to make sure students were safe during and as they left the meeting. Schofield told theWFB:No student should ever feel unsafe on their campus but through the passage of even this neutral resolution, it has happened at UIC. People can find ways to spin the facts to support messages of hate, but I will always be proud of the work that was done. And, done by students this legislature was intended to intimidate, but were instead the ones who created something positive out of it, even if the other groups don’t want to acknowledge that.Despite that their resolution was materially altered from a direct attack specifically on Israel to one leveled out over many nations making the resolution relatively toothless, anti-Israel groups both inside and outside UIC cluelessly hailed the resolution as a victory.Ahmad Albanna, USG senator and a Muslim organizer ofUIC Divest 2016said:This vote comes after weeks of hard work by UIC students to raise awareness on campus. We held multiple workshops, actions, events, and tabled for days in the student center, gathering hundreds of signatures on a petition, in order to ensure that students were informed on the issue. We are ecstatic that USG did the right thing in voting unanimously to divest, withstanding pressure from opposition and outside lobbyist organizations.A website calling itself the Arab Daily Newshailed the resolutionas one condemning the “Israeli occupation” of Palestine, despite the altered language of the resolution. The site Palestine In America alsocelebrated the decisionas one aimed solely at the so-called occupation of Palestine.Regardless, UIC Jewish groups are decrying the double standard the various groups were held to and demanded that school officials address the lack of transparency.“Considering that Jewish students were held to very different standards than BDS activists, were subject to hostile questioning and were given no clear directives about how to participate in the process, they did a remarkable job,” Rabbi Seth Winberg, executive director of Metro Chicago Hillel, toldJUFNews.com.“The anti-Semitic nature of the global BDS movement has poisoned the atmosphere and distorted the debate about issues of concern to many students,” added Emily Briskman, executive director of JUF’s Israel Education Center. “Through their thoughtful, principled and tenacious work, the students at UIC are changing the nature of the debate.”Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthustonor email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com"

This desire to keep working after enjoying a financial windfall is higher today than in three earlier Gallup measures, all prior to the 2008-2009 recession.With so much talk about the entitlement society, government dependency, and the deterioration of the American work ethic, I thought this was an interesting discovery.Perhaps most significantly, in the 18-34 year-old bracket, 46% said they would continue in their current job if they won ten million dollars in the lottery. Thirty-six percent would continue in a different job, while only 18% would stop working.That’s the youth vote, my friends.So, for those assuming that young voters simply want something for nothing, don’t understand the value of hard work, and/or are mesmerized by government dependency, you just might be off the mark.I’ll say it again and again: In most cases, young people like their freedoms.

626088525,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2010/05/18/Arizonas-Immigration-Law,Arizona's Immigration Law,"The recent law passed in Arizona raises some tough questions.   How does one respond to a state law that enforces federal law?   Our President said it was “misguided.” Many state and city politicians in California have said it is time to boycott Arizona for its “harsh” immigration policy.   One Los Angeles Councilmen said that Arizona is acting like it is its own country.   One Texas Congressman said that the law is something he wants in his state.   A city councilman in Costa Mesa, CA said that the city is going to copy it and make it an ordinance.   Many activist groups have now filed legal suits against Arizona’s newest law, but many experts say that the law will stand.Having grown up the son of an immigrant, I know firsthand the hardship of having no roots and being in a strange place.   I was born in New York and moved to the San Fernando Valley.   My father struggled to put food on the table, and I had to work as a young man.   I had my own paper route and worked hard.   When I graduated high school, I received a scholarship to USC.   This is the dream that most immigrants have for their children.California became the place where dreams came true for my parents and me.   My father taught me that to be a good citizen you have to follow the laws.   I believe that still today.   I am successful because I have followed the laws of this great nation.   I believe, to find success in this country it must first start there.   I have driven past Home Depots, like many of you.   I think about the lives those men are living and my heart hurts for them.   I know they struggle to put food on the table just like my father did.   I know they came here seeking a better life for their children.   I understand their plight, but their method in achieving that goal is what I cannot understand.Our current system has moved beyond common sense.   Our President has failed to uphold the laws set out by Congress and states are not allowed to enforce the federal laws.   Immigration and Customs Enforcement lack funding and staff to handle the current situation.   We have judges and district attorneys that are more dedicated to sentencing ICE agents then to enforcing our immigration laws.This issue is no longer one which we can sit idly by and hope for a solution. We have solutions. First, we need to secure our borders. Second, we need to remove all financial incentives for illegal immigrants. And third, we need to demonstrate the clear and responsible pathway to legal immigration.Arizona passed legislation allowing local law enforcement agencies to work with federal agents.   We have laws in this country for a reason and they need to be enforced.   The American dream is something that I believe in, but a vital part of that dream is honoring the laws that we have established.   If I am elected to the 42nd Congressional district in California I will stand in the way of any amnesty bill or pathway to citizenship that does not honor those that have sought to come here legally.   I fight daily to uphold and defend the Constitution and the values that hold it in place.   We need responsible common sense immigration policies. As the son of an immigrant, I am pro-immigration but oppose the recent wave of illegal aliens.   John Adams said “Government is instituted for the common good; for the protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness of the people…”   We stand at a pivotal moment; to create and protect opportunity and call upon our leaders to ensure the will and protection of the people of the United States of America."

She wore a wide smile in taking her seat next to co-host George Stephanopoulos on TV’s top-rated morning show.“I have been waiting 174 days to say this,” Roberts said. “Good morning, America.”The bulk of the ABC show turned into a celebration of her return as she’s recovering from MDS, a blood and bone marrow disease.

When Roberts thanked her nurses on the air, all of the show producers in the control room a floor away stood and applauded. Sherwood delivered a champagne toast on the set after the show went off the air at 9 a.m.“Can I go home now?” Roberts said, before delivering a tearful thank you to her colleagues.Bottles of hand sanitizers were kept nearby for people who come into regular contact with Roberts, who must try to avoid contact with others as her immune system builds back up. The plan is for Roberts to work two or three days a week initially and her health will be closely monitored, said Tom Cibrowski, the show’s senior executive producer.Roberts said after the show that she wasn’t tired and was working on adrenaline. But the bright studio lights affected her eyesight. She said she started having trouble seeing the teleprompters midway through the show.She has a tough schedule her first week back. She’s expected to co-host the show Thursday and perhaps Friday, tape an interview with first lady Michelle Obama on Friday and fly to California. She’ll participate in Oscars coverage and make an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel’s post-Oscars show. Even her doctor, Gail Roboz, while clearing Roberts’ return, said, “we didn’t exactly have in mind an interview with Michelle Obama and the Oscars this weekend.”Roberts said her doctors are watching her closely, and they told her to cool it two weeks ago during an appearance in New Orleans.“I’m not worried about having to be here, or the need to be here,” Roberts said. “I want to be here.”The return date was important psychologically because it was during Academy Awards coverage last year that Roberts said she felt bone-tired, almost unable to work, and went to the doctor shortly afterward for the blood test that turned up her disease.She said her hair stylist came up with a wig for her to wear with bangs similar to Michelle Obama’s. But Roberts said viewers had already seen her on the air with her thin layer of hair and she thought a wig would be too distracting.“It’s freeing, it really is,” she said.Amy Robach and Elizabeth Vargas largely filled in for Roberts during her absence, although there were occasional celebrity “guest hosts” like Charlie Sheen, Stephen Colbert and Jessica Simpson. The show didn’t miss a beat, not losing a single week to NBC’s “Today” show while she was gone, a development Sherwood admitted was a surprise. An unintended consequence was that her absence enabled an ensemble that also includes Josh Elliott, Lara Spencer and Sam Champion to grow stronger and become more familiar to viewers, he said.The “Today” show sent a gift basket that “Good Morning America” displayed in its studio, and gave Roberts an on-air welcome.“She’s looking and feeling great,” said NBC’s Savannah Guthrie. “And I know we’re all really happy for her.”The return of Roberts, which Sherwood called “a day that we all rejoice,” could also give ABC new momentum in the contest for morning television dominance. NBC’s top anchor, Matt Lauer, is on vacation this week.“Having Robin back is going to take us to new levels, to new heights,” Cibrowski said."

A final award that includes interest and attorneys’ fees will be issued after a hearing on May 30.BlackBerry shares climbed 16 percent to $8.94 at 1:30 p.m. in New York on Nasdaq. Qualcomm’s stock price declined 3.1 percent to $53.64 on Nasdaq.The refund, which is about 20 percent of its current market cap, will allow the Canadian-based company to shift from its failing cellphone business to making software.BlackBerry had $286 million in revenue last quarter, according to its financial filing on March 31.“With BlackBerry planning to invest for growth in its software businesses, the surprising arbitration award and $815 million in cash from Qualcomm will bolster BlackBerry’s balance sheet and increase the likelihood of acquisitions to augment growth,” Canaccord Genuity technology analyst Michael Walkley wrote Wednesday in a report obtained by Bloomberg. He raised his BlackBerry price target to $9.50 from $8.In 2010, BlackBerry signed a non-refundable agreement with Qualcomm to cover royalty payments through 2015. It shipped far fewer phones than it expected, leading it to seek a refund on some of the payments.“While Qualcomm does not agree with the decision, it is binding and not appealable,” Qualcomm said in a statement. “The arbitration decision was limited to prepayment provisions unique to BlackBerry’s license agreement with Qualcomm and has no impact on agreements with any other licensee.”Qualcomm, based in San Diego, owns patents that cover the fundamentals of cellphone technology and receives a portion of the selling price of handsets from phone makers, regardless of whether the chips are used.The chipmaker is the biggest producer of semiconductors that run smartphonesOther lawsuits and regulatory actions have targeted Qualcomm’s licensing business.Apple has accused Qualcomm of illegally trying to control the market for phone components. Qualcomm in a counter suit last week said Apple wants to pay lower fees by ending the chipmaker’s dominance. Apple is Qualcomm’s biggest customer."

5862656244,http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/05/30/el-paso-sues-stop-texas-sanctuary-ban/,El Paso Sues to Stop Texas ‘Sanctuary’ Ban,"The Texas border county of El Paso filed a federal lawsuit last week against the State to stop the “sanctuary” cities ban from going into effect, alleging the new law is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and impedes public safety efforts.San Antonio-based law firm Garza Golando Moran, PLLC, filed the 29-page lawsuit on behalf of El Paso County, El Paso Sheriff Richard Wiles, and the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund (TOPEF). The plaintiffs seek to declare the “sanctuary” ban unconstitutional and recover court costs. They also sued Governor Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and the Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCaw in their official capacities.In a litany of allegations, the lawsuit echoes the progressive left’s claims about the anti-sanctuary citySenate Bill 4, as xenophobic, “unprecedented, cruel, and vague” and based on “irrational, unfounded fears of immigrants,” that “invites racial profiling” of “Texans of Hispanic heritage and immigrants and their families, particularly those from Mexico, Central America, and other Spanish-speaking countries.” It asserts SB 4 will make “all Texans less safe,” usurp “existing decision-making processes of local officials, prevent the reporting of crimes, allow local law enforcement officers to demand “papers” from virtually anyone in Texas at any time, and violates the United States and Texas constitutions.The complaint describes El Paso as the largest U.S.-Mexico Border community with 800,000-plus residents, over 82 percent of them Hispanic, and where more than 25 percent of its inhabitants are foreign born. It claims it is “impossible to detach SB 4 from the cultural context in which it was passed” by the 2017 Texas Legislature, charging the state and national 2016 elections as “riddled with nativist and anti-immigrant appeals.”The lawsuit also asserts SB 4 is “harmful” to the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund (TOPEF), an educationnon-profitbased in San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas. TOPEF says more than half of their employees and people they serve are Latino and many of them come from “immigrant, mixed-status families” who will be “particularly injured” by this law. The group claims it has “organizational and associational standing to bring this lawsuit.” The Texas Civil Rights Projects represents them in the complaint.TOPEF’sleftistparent organization, the Texas Organizing Project (TOP), was formerly known as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, the radical group implicated in massive voter registration fraud during the 2008 presidential election, among other related scams,according toDiscover the Networks. ACORN advocated open-door immigration policy.Although ACORN disbanded as a national entity in 2010, they morphed into state-level groups like the Texas Organizing Project,foundedby “veteran community and electoral organizer” Ginny Goldman, who headed up ACORN’s Texas chapter. In 2016, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turnerappointedher onto his executive transition team. The Oakland, California-based Social Transformation Projectlistsher on their Leading from the Inside Out (LIO) network. The left-wing projectsaysit works with nearly 300 groups including MoveOn.org, theCenter for Popular Democracy, and La Raza.Allegations in this lawsuit mirror assertions made by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) in a complaintfiledby officials from the border town of El Cenizo one day after Abbott signed SB 4 into law.On May 7, Abbott signed SB 4, the toughest anti-sanctuary city law in the nation. It calls for criminal and civil penalties plus steep fines for Texas sheriffs and police chiefs who refuse to honor detainer requests issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, Breitbart Texasreported.Abbott said: “Let’s be clear about something. We all support legal immigration. It helped to build America and Texas,” the governor said before signing the bill. “Legal immigration is different from harboring people who have committed dangerous crimes. This law cracks down on policies like the Travis County sheriff who declared she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes. Those policies are sanctuary city policies and won’t be tolerated in Texas.”On May 8, Paxton filed a preemptive lawsuit in federal court to uphold the law’s constitutionality. It goes into effect on September 1. In a statement, hetoldBreitbart Texas: “SB 4 is constitutional, lawful and a vital step in securing our borders,” noting the law “guarantees cooperation among federal, state and local law enforcement to protect Texans. Unfortunately, some municipalities and law enforcement agencies are unwilling to cooperate with the federal government and claim that SB 4 is unconstitutional.”Previously, Breitbart Texasreported:Despite rumors being spread by the bill’s opponents, SB4 prohibits an officer from asking about the immigration status of any crime victim or witness to a crime. An exception is included if the person’s immigration status is germane to the crime as in a human smuggling crime, or when the victim or witness could obtain a protected immigrant status under provisions provided to a witness or crime victim.Still, last Friday, Efrén Olivares, racial and economic justice director for the Texas Civil Rights Project,insistedSB 4 violated the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. In anAustin American-Statesmanop-ed, he cited findings from a Soros-funded Center for American Progress study, claiming “three of every five people in Texas will be at risk of being profiled based on the color of their skin.”Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, onTwitter.El Paso County Lawsuit Against State of TexasbyBreitbartTexason Scribd"

1900843633,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA9LETN80,Doctor's mistress testifies at murder trial,"(AP) Doctor’s mistress testifies at murder trialBy PAUL FOYAssociated PressPROVO, UtahThe mistress of a Utah doctor accused of murder testified Friday that she started a sexual relationship with him more than a year before his wife’s death.Gypsy Willis said Martin MacNeill put her up in a duplex, gave her a debit card for expenses, and helped pay for her schooling as a nursing student.Willis, 37, insisted the relationship with a man 20 years older was mostly casual and is over. Prosecutors have argued it was his motive for killing his wife in 2007. Michele MacNeill was found in a bathtub in her home.Willis said she met MacNeill online by trading messages and was soon getting together with him at random times.“We had sex half the time,” Willis said. “Sometimes, it was just lunch.”Her testimony was interrupted when the judge called a break in the trial for a long weekend. She’ll return to the stand Tuesday.Willis is testifying under a deal with prosecutors on identity-theft charges that kept her out of jail. She was accused of taking the identity of one of MacNeill’s adopted daughters.The doctor invited Willis to his wife’s funeral, hired her as a nanny and asked her to marry him weeks later, at her parent’s house in Wyoming. It isn’t clear if they ever got a marriage certificate. Willis’ parents are set to testify next week.Willis said she traded about 22 text messages with MacNeill on the day of the funeral, including several during the service.MacNeill, 57, is accused of hounding his wife, Michele MacNeill, to have a face-lift, then mixing a lethal combination of drugs for her recovery and helping her into the tub.Defense attorneys counter that she died from a heart condition. MacNeill has said he found her slumped face-down in bath water.Earlier Friday, 4th District Judge Derek Pullan ruled that MacNeill’s youngest daughter will be allowed to offer limited courtroom testimony about how she found her mother’s body submerged in the tub. Pullan said many of the girl’s memories were tainted by an older sister who strongly believes Martin MacNeill killed his wife.Pullan ruled 12-year-old Ada MacNeill can be questioned only about statements she gave a professional counselor several years ago. The girl was 6 years old when she found her mom in the tub.“Ada is highly susceptible to suggestion by Alexis (MacNeill) and has been influenced by adults in her life who are biased” and serve as her caretakers, Pullan said from the bench. The jury was not present for his ruling.A forensic toxicologist took the stand first Friday, saying Michele MacNeill’s blood had four central nervous system depressants in it that would have had a powerful knock-out effect because she wasn’t used to taking any of them _ she was “drug-naive,” said Gary Dawson, the witness.On Thursday, Alexis and another sibling testified their father was eager to demonstrate how their mother ended up dead in the tub, and about how quickly he introduced a nanny who, according to the sisters, didn’t cook, clean or take care of the youngest children in the family of eight.The oldest sibling, Rachel MacNeill, said while growing up, her father was her best friend and that she was closer to him than to her mother. When she learned of her mother’s death, she didn’t suspect her father and wanted to comfort him, she said.But her suspicions quickly grew at a family lunch after their mother’s funeral that turned sour.Her father was “commenting on how he’s a single man now, and he kept it very casual,” Rachel MacNeill said. “He was making jokes about being single, and he was laughing. It made me sick. I left.”"
6125949339,http://www.breitbart.com/news/tom-ford-launches-fashion-week-with-sequins-celebs-galore/,"Tom Ford launches Fashion Week with sequins, celebs galore","NEW YORK (AP) — The first day of Fashion Week brought glitz, glamour and a slew of celebrities at Tom Ford’s ’90s-themed show, and a prestigious award for designer Thom Browne. Some of the highlights:___SEQUINS, CELEBS, BRIGHT COLORS AND A ’90s VIBE AT TOM FORDNo one ever said Tom Ford didn’t know how to make an entrance, or in this case, how to launch Fashion Week with a bang. Ford’s show at the cavernous Park Avenue Armory was a celebrity event of major proportion, drawing everyone from Kim Kardashian West to Julianne Moore to Liev Schreiber to Chaka Khan to Ciara to Cindy Crawford. No wonder the opening song on the soundtrack was David Bowie’s “Fame.”Guests entering the vast space, which felt like a luxurious living room bathed in rose-hued light, were offered a vodka cocktail or flute of champagne. On the sides of the room, two massive bars were being readied for the after-party.The lights dimmed, and Ford’s models emerged, first wearing casual clothes like slouchy, satiny trousers, paired with billowing jackets or blazers with exaggerated shoulders. There were leather trenches in bright orange or brilliant white. Some of the trousers hung low enough to expose the wearer’s hip bones, under their clingy bodysuits. A few mini-dresses were bathed in bright sequins and short enough that they revealed way more than legs.Then the mood went from casual to glamorous; suddenly a parade of elegant gowns appeared, sheer and ruched, with bright sequins on the arms, for just enough bling.“I always like to use a little something that catches the light,” Ford explained afterward in an interview, “because they’re also red carpet dresses.” He also wanted to create a contrast between day and night.“You know the way women dress today is very different. Day clothes as we knew them don’t exist anymore. Women wear jeans, a T-shirt, a great jacket … and as they go out to lunch or dinner, they pop on a pair of high heels.” His gowns, he said, were a different thing entirely — which is why he paused the music, lowered the light and then brought out supermodel Gigi Hadid in an elegant ruched gown in dusty rose, with long sequined sleeves.Ford said he was going for a ’90s vibe, “for the kind of energy that my collections had at Gucci (then). And there are a lot of sort of ’90s things floating around in fashion right now. There’s another thing in fashion now which is ‘more is more is more is more’ … but I wanted to have something slicker, sleeker, more streamlined. Really, just to capture the energy of that period.”Ford is a busy man; aside from being a successful designer and now filmmaker, with the lauded 2016 “Nocturnal Animals,” he’s just launched a new fragrance, which has a title we can’t write here — but the second word is “Fabulous.”“You know, face it, we’re in 2017,” he said, explaining the profane title. “It’s modern parlance today.” He explained that he came upon the title when he was working on the fragrance and smelled just the right combination — and uttered the future title.“It’s only available in our stores,” he noted. “We haven’t advertised it, so a child is not going to encounter the bottle and say, ‘Mom and Dad, what’s this word?”As for his growing film career, Ford noted that there’s a lot of similarity between working in film and fashion.“Whether you’re designing a brand or a film …. you have to have a vision, you have to have something to say,” he said. “The basic instincts that I’ve had in fashion for a long time also worked in film.”Actor Liev Schreiber said he’d come to honor Ford as a friend, as well as a designer and a filmmaker.“This is the first fashion show I’ve ever been to,” he confessed beforehand.As for Kardashian West, it certainly wasn’t her first fashion show — but it was her first Ford show.“I’m such a big fan of the brand,” she said in an interview. “I’ve worn him for so long. Such a fan since (his) Gucci days and beyond. So I’m really excited to see what this collection is going to look like.”—Jocelyn Noveck___WHOOPI GOLDBERG HONORS THOM BROWNEActress and TV host Whoopi Goldberg feted designer Thom Browne at an awards luncheon kicking off Fashion Week, praising him as an innovator who knows fashion is something that makes you feel good — and celebrates individuality.Browne “makes things for people who WANT to wear them,” Goldberg said. “When you want to wear something, your head is always up.” Wearing a bright orange Browne creation that resembled a floral beach robe, paired with a bright red head covering, Goldberg spoke of times in her life when she herself was made fun of for clothes she chose to wear.“I wore stuff that worked for me,” Goldberg said. “I’m not everybody’s taste, I’m my own taste.” She said Browne was a designer who represented “the idea that you must be an individual and stand for something.”Goldberg was presenting Browne with the Couture Council Award for Artistry in Fashion, from the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Browne — known for his whimsical and theatrical fashion shows, but also for the craftsmanship and originality of his clothes — won’t be showing in New York this Fashion Week. He’s moving his womenswear show to Paris, where he already shows his menswear. His move follows that of other top labels like Proenza Schouler, Rodarte and Altuzarra.Browne is still best known for his menswear, especially his famous signature look of the “shrunken” suit: Pants that end above the ankle (or shorts), a small suit jacket, and especially no socks.Goldberg said that when Browne debuted that look years ago, “People around the world said, ‘Oh yeah, you’re speaking to me, Thom.'”Taking his turn at the microphone, Browne described how when he was starting out, he was the only one in New York dressing like he did, and schoolkids would look and say, “It’s Pee-wee Herman!”Browne teared up when he thanked his life partner, Andrew Bolton, the creator of blockbuster shows at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he is curator. And he committed to continuing to produce fashion that was “timeless, with a clear and individual point of view.”Among the guests at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center were Brooke Shields and Martha Stewart.—Jocelyn Noveck"

Venezuelan troops, in response, attacked her and the thousands behind her with teargas, blocking her way.In a dramatic sagaplaying out on Twitter, as the repressive socialist Venezuelan government blocked media outlets from covering the occasion, Machado organized a protest in the Caracas neighborhood of Chacaito to announce her plans to defy a government order that keeps her out of office. Cabello officially ousted her from the legislatureafter her trip to Washington, D.C., where Machado attempted to persuade members of the Organization of American States to intervene in the violent situation in Venezuela.She told the crowd joining her there,estimated to be in the thousands, that she would return to the National Assembly despite being stripped of her title by Cabello because it was “the highest honor a citizen can be given, to represent the people,” and that “only the people can take that from me.” Machado was accompanied by Lilian Tintori, the wife of Popular Will party leader Leopoldo López, who has become the nation’s most famous political prisoner.As Machado mounted a motorcycle to ride to the National Assembly, the protesters began to follow, which prompted a teargas attack from the National Guard. It is yet unknown how many were injured in the repressive scuffle, butInfobae reportsthat Machado herself was hit with the toxic gas and published a photo uploaded to Twitter by BBC reporter Daniel Pardo.pic.twitter.com/ksxbo9EljN— Daniel Pardo (@pardodaniel)April 1, 2014"" data-btlnk=""

After several minutes of mixed reports from protesters in the area that Machado had been attacked and arrested, the BBC reported that Machado had not been aggrieved, but was not giving up on her mission to return to her post at the Assembly. Machado then boarded her motorcycle and turned to the Venezuelan Supreme Court, where she told the media she would appeal the decision to remove her from her post. “All avenues must be exhausted,”she told the BBC.Machado is the most prominent member of the Venezuelan opposition not currently in jail, as her position in the National Assembly made provided her legislative immunity until Cabello stripped her of her title. Machado has been struggling against the Chavista government for years, most prominently having her nose broken and sent into surgery after a Chavista legislatorphysically assaulted her on the floor of the National Assembly last year(graphic video of the attackhere). Nancy Ascencio, the congresswoman who broke Machado’s nose,attacked her at an airport once again later that year.President Maduro has warned in recent weeks that he is shifting in focus from repressing student protests toarresting public officials who disagree with him. In addition to Machado’s ouster, Maduroarrestedthree unnamed generals for “organizing a coup” and two mayors of opposition cities for conspiring against the government. A report released Monday estimated that the Venezuelan government has been arrestingone protester every half hoursince the arrest of Leopoldo López on February 18."

Museum of broken hearts has the antidote,"Zagreb (AFP) – Forget romantic dinners and roses, the place to be on Valentine’s Day is Zagreb’s Museum of Broken Relationships, a paean to personal objects and stories of heartbreak.From a toaster to an exercise bike and a pair of lacy bras, the small museum imbues seemingly ordinary objects with meaning through captions that detail their role in the unravelling of relationships around the world.The stories swerve from humourous to heart-wrenching.The museum was buzzing Thursday, Valentine’s Day, with groups of friends and also some couples seeking out an unorthodox way to celebrate love.“Today being Valentine’s Day, it’s beautiful to read these small little stories,” said Kriti Pandey, who came with her husband Pathak.One of the lighter rooms, called “Take the bitter with the sweet,” showcases objects like a box of pizza-making ingredients — a love letter to one woman’s break-up with gluten — and a diet book with the caption: “This was a present from my ex-fiance… Need I really continue?”But the mood is heavier in “Love in the trenches,” an exhibit with items like a wedding dress from Turkey, never worn because of the groom’s unexpected death.Nearby is a prosthetic leg from a veteran from Croatia’s 1990s war.“The prosthesis endured longer than our love,” the caption reads.The unusual idea was born from heartbreak itself.After a break-up, the museum’s two Croatian founders, artists Olinka Vistica and Drazen Grubisic, both turning 50 this year, didn’t know what to do with their shared belongings and wanted to create an option other than the garbage bin.More than a decade later, they have taken the museum on tours to 50 cities around the globe, collecting new objects and stories along the way.“When we started with the project I had no idea what (kind of donations) we were going to get… but it turns out that people are so interesting, everybody has a story to tell,” co-founder Grubisic told AFP, adding that they receive around 200 objects by mail per year.Jon Turner, a 33-year-old British tourist travelling solo in Zagreb, agreed the authentic portrayal of love was a fitting occasion for any visitor on February 14.“It’s really beautiful, some things have made me laugh out loud, some things have made me cry, but yeah I think it’s really nice you get a snapshot of people’s lives,” he said.The theme of the museum’s next overseas stop, the city of York, will revolve around a different kind of break-up: Brexit.Organisers have put out a local call for donations that will put a personal spin on the political drama.“Recently ended a relationship? Wish to unburden the emotional load by erasing everything that reminds you of that painful experience?” the call of submissions asks.“Don’t,” it advises, “one day you might regret it.”"

What’s being done to be sure my guns aren’t taken away?” He said he lives with the added anxiety of questioning his every trip to the doctor, fearing that he is one visit away from having his gun rights snuffed out.To clear, veterans have worried about the state of their gun rights for a number of years now. At first the concern was tied to whether a veteran could manage his or her own money. In July 2015 theLos Angeles Timesreported on “a strategy used by the Department of Veterans Affairs” whereby a veteran “declared incompetent to manage pension or disability payments and assigned a fiduciary” is reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS). Translation: the inability to handle money following the strain of war and possible life and death battles is being used to deny certain veterans the right to buy a gun.This came into stark relief January 5, when Obama’s executive gun control included a ban on gun ownership forsome Social Security beneficiaries. Like the ban being applied to veterans, the the Social Security gun ban is based whether beneficiaries can handle their own finances.  And this new ban–plus Obama’s expanded emphasis on using the category of “mental health” to keep guns out of the hands of more and more people–has veterans worried that a trip to the doctor to discuss symptoms of PTSD could result in the loss of gun rights.The fear is widely discussed among veterans, recently prompting theMilitary Timesto warn that some veterans are on the verge of foregoing treatment they need in order to guard the perpetuity of their gun rights.On January 6–the day after Obama announced his executive gun controls–Military Times quoted American Legion National Commander Dale Barnett, saying, “The American Legion strongly believes that treatment for PTSD or depression by itself, which a number of wartime veterans experience, should not be the sole factor in denying a veteran the right to purchase a firearm.”Barnett added:Barring some additional circumstances that would indicate that a veteran represents a dangerous threat, veterans should not have to forfeit their Second Amendment rights. Veterans have  fought to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. The American Legion believes that the rights of these heroes deserve protection.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

6906475770,https://www.breitbart.com/news/pro-brexit-group-predicts-uk-boom-after-eu-departure/,Pro-Brexit group predicts UK boom after EU departure,"London (AFP) – A pro-Brexit group of Conservative lawmakers predicted on Tuesday Britain will enjoy an economic boom if it trades with the EU under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules after Brexit.Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May’s Tory party presented an alternative plan to the government’s that envisions a clean break from the EU bloc.The question of how to engineer Britain’s departure without ruining its economy in the process has torn apart the ruling party since the Brexit referendum was passed in 2016.Britain will formally leave the EU on March 29 even if no deal on the divorce terms is reached.A group calling itself the Economists for Free Trade presented the plan on Tuesday, saying it was offering a “Clean Brexit — that is, a World Trade Deal under WTO rules.”The deal “would allow us to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, regain control over our borders, laws, and regulations, free ourselves from the European Court of Justice, and have freedom to establish our own trading relationships with the rest of the world,” the group said.The WTO plan meets the demands of the most strident proponents of Britain charting its own course in trade relations and wresting back legal levers of power from Brussels.The government is instead proposing a plan to continue trading in goods with the EU under a “common rulebook” after Brexit to ensure frictionless trade at the border.Tuesday’s event included former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and leading conservative Jacob Rees-Moog as well others whose views differ sharply from those of most members of May’s cabinet.Some economists question the wisdom of relying on the unwieldy 164-nation World Trade Organization for defining a nation’s basic trade terms with its closest partners.But the pro-Brexit group said WTO rules would help the UK economy expand by an additional seven percent over the government’s current projections for growth for the coming 15 years.“The average household would gain around 8 percent, while the poorest household will be 15 percent better off,” the report said.“The Treasury will receive about 10 percent extra revenue — around £80 billion ($104 billion, 90 billion euros).”The group said the benefits would come mostly from Britain signing new and more advantageous free trade agreements.The WTO “deal does not imply ‘walking away’ from the Brussels negotiations, as there are other aspects of the new EU-UK relationship… that need to be agreed,” the group said.“A World Trade Deal only implies that there will not be an EU trade deal –- not that there will be no deal on anything at all.”"

6769366538,https://www.breitbart.com/news/boys-coach-in-stable-health-after-10-days-lost-in-thai-cave/,"Boys, coach in stable health after 10 days lost in Thai cave","MAE SAI, Thailand (AP) — The 12 boys and soccer coach found in a partially flooded cave in northern Thailand after 10 days are mostly in stable medical condition and have received high-protein liquid food, officials said Tuesday, though it is not known when they will be able to go home.Video released early Tuesday by the Thai navy showed the boys in their soccer uniforms sitting on a dry area inside the cave above the water as a spotlight, apparently from a rescuer, illuminated their faces. The boys were found late Monday night during a desperate search that drew international help and captivated the nation.Chiang Rai provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said the health of the boys and coach were checked using a field assessment in which red is critical condition, yellow is serious and green is stable.“We found that most of the boys are in green condition,” he said. “Maybe some of the boys have injuries or light injuries and would be categorized as yellow condition. But no one is in red condition.”When the group will be able to leave the cave isn’t known due to flooding and other factors that could make their extraction dangerous. Experts have said it could be safer to simply supply them where they are for now. Thailand’s rainy season typically lasts through October.Family members of the missing hugged each other and cheered as they heard they had been found.Aisha Wiboonrungrueng, the mother of 11-year-old Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, smiled and hugged her family as news of their discovery spread. She said she would cook her son a Thai omelet, his favorite food, when he returns home.Rescue divers had spent much of Monday making preparations for a final push to locate the lost soccer players, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach. Flooding trapped them after they entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai on June 23.Divers found the group about 300-400 meters (yards) past a section of the cave on higher ground that was thought to be where they might have taken shelter.In the 5-minute navy video, the boys are quiet as they sit on their haunches, legs bent in front of them. “You are very strong,” one of the rescuers says in English. Someone asks what day it is, and the rescuer responds, “Monday. Monday. You have been here — 10 days.”One boy, noticing the camera and hearing unfamiliar words, says in Thai, “Oh, they want to take a picture; tell him we’re hungry. I haven’t had anything to eat.”Then the boy breaks into simple English, saying, “Eat, eat, eat,” to which another voice responds in Thai that he already told that to the rescuer.Narongsak said Tuesday that the missing were given high-protein liquid food, painkillers and antibiotics. He said doctors had advised giving the medicine as a preventative measure.Anmar Mirza, a leading American cave rescue expert, said many challenges remain for the rescuers. He said the primary decision is whether to try to evacuate the boys and their coach or to supply them in place.“Supplying them on site may face challenges depending on how difficult the dives are,” Mirza, coordinator of the U.S. National Cave Rescue Commission, said in an email. “Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy. That also begets the question: If the dives are difficult then supply will be difficult, but the risk of trying to dive them out is also exponentially greater.”Narongsak said officials had met and agreed on the need to “ensure 100 percent safety for the boys when we bring them out.”“We worked so hard to find them and we will not lose them,” he said.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha thanked the international experts and rescuers who helped locate the missing for their “tremendous efforts.”“The Royal Thai Government and the Thai people are grateful for this support and cooperation, and we all wish the team a safe and speedy recovery,” Prayuth’s office said in a statement.The rescuers had been stymied repeatedly by rising water that forced divers to withdraw for safety reasons. When water levels fell Sunday, the divers went forward with a more methodical approach, deploying a rope line and extra oxygen supplies along the way.Teams have also been working to pump water out of the cave and divert groundwater, while other rescuers focused on exploring shafts above ground that might lead into the cave. Several fissures were found and teams have explored some, though none led to the missing group.Experts in cave rescues from around the world had gathered at the site. An official Australian group has followed a U.S. military team, British cave experts, Chinese lifesaving responders and several other volunteer groups from various countries.“These are challenging conditions and there’s a lot of consideration for safety as well as, the environment outside is contributing to the environment inside,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Jessica Tait, part of a 30-member U.S. military team assisting in the search, referring to the rain that has been flooding the cave. “So I’d say, yeah, it’s an accurate statement that it’s challenging.”"
5369510701,http://www.breitbart.com/news/rebels-push-forward-in-southern-syria/,Rebels push forward in southern Syria,"BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian rebels backed by the United States are making their biggest gains yet south of the capital Damascus, capturing a string of towns from government forces and aiming to carve out a swath of territory leading to the doorstep of President Bashar Assad’s seat of power.The advances appear to be a rare visible success story from efforts by the U.S. and its allies to train and arm moderate rebel fighters.The rebel forces are believed to include fighters who graduated from a nearly 2-year-old CIA training program based in Syria’s southern neighbor Jordan. The group known as the Friends of Syria, including Jordan, France the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, are backing the rebels with money and weapons, said Gen. Ibrahim Jbawi, the spokesman for the Free Syrian Army’s southern front.The gains are a contrast to northern Syria, where U.S.-backed rebels are collapsing in the face of an assault by Islamic militants. Notably, in the south, the rebels are working together with fighters from al-Qaida’s Syria branch, whose battle-hardened militants have helped them gain the momentum against government forces. The cooperation points to the difficulty in American efforts to build up “moderate” factions while isolating extremists.“The goal is to reach the capital … because there is no way to bring down the regime without reaching Damascus,” said Ahmad al-Masalmeh, an opposition activist in Daraa.But few are under the illusion that the offensive in the south can loosen Assad’s grip on power in the near future. The Syrian leader has benefited from the U.S.-led coalition’s war against the Islamic State group, which has had the side effect of freeing up Assad’s forces to focus on more moderate rebels elsewhere in the country. Government forces have seized several key areas around the capital.Jbawi said the international support for the assault “is not enough to let the rebels win the battle militarily. They are backing (us) to pressure Bashar Assad’s regime to bring him to the negotiating table.”The Islamic State group’s onslaught in Syria and Iraq has given greater urgency to international efforts to find some sort of solution for Syria’s conflict, which has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced millions. Previous attempts and two rounds of peace talks in Switzerland earlier this year failed to make any progress as each side remained convinced it could win the war militarily.The U.N. envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has now proposed local cease-fires starting with the northern city of Aleppo as a building block for a wider solution — an idea that Assad has said is “worth studying.”Speaking by telephone, Jbawi said 54 rebel factions consisting of 30,000 fighters are taking part in the battles in southern Syria. Activists say that Jordan is also facilitating the rebels’ push by arming some rebels and allowing them to cross freely to and from the country.The rebel offensive gained momentum two months ago, leading to the capture of much of the Quneitra region bordering Syria’s Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, as well as large areas in the southern province of Daraa on the border with Jordan.These included the town of Nawa and the Harra hill, a strategic hill where Syrian troops had stationed monitoring equipment because of its proximity to Israeli army positions in the Golan. The hill, one of the highest in Daraa province, also overlooks a main road that rebels use.More recently, the fighting has been concentrated in and around the contested village of Sheikh Maskeen and the nearby Brigade 82 base, one of the main government units in the province. If the rebels capture the village and the base they will be then able to threaten the Damascus-Daraa highway, a main lifeline for government forces.On Friday, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the government carried out some 60 air raids on areas in Daraa province, many of them on Sheikh Maskeen and nearby areas. The group, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said the air raids killed at least nine people and wounded others.The rebel offensive could eventually link opposition fighters’ positions in Daraa and Quneitra with Damascus’ rebel-held Ghouta suburbs.“The military objective is to secure lines of communication and to put pressure on the capital,” said Faysal Itani, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.However, despite the rebel advance, Assad’s forces remain strong in the area, holding bases in critical locations that the rebels will find difficult to capture, he said.Daraa-based activist Ibrahim Hariri said that while government forces collapsed in some parts of the province, they still hold much of the city of Daraa and control the Daraa-Damascus highway, “the spine of the province.”“The regime always has a very big force in Daraa because it is close to the front with Israel,” Hariri said. “Any attempt to reach Damascus will not be an easy mission.”___Follow Bassem Mroue on Twitter at http://twitter.com/bmroue"

It was announced that he had joined Quilliam as a researcher in their Theology and Outreach team just days ago.However, the popular imam faced an immediate and ferocious backlash from conservative and Islamist Muslims on social media for engaging with the think tank, which advises the government on radicalisation and counter terrorism. He announced on Twitter last night: “Due 2 physical threats (outside the mosque)I have decided 2 resign.Despite requests 2 stay.”“Do you have no shame?

Have you no shame?” he added, alongside a photo-shopped image of the Imam surrounded by money.He described other members of the foundation as “sellouts” for working against radicalisation and terrorism. Quilliam members have frequently been accused of apostasy a being “uncle Toms” – a racial epithet hurled at integrated people of an ethnic background.Adam Deen, the foundation’s other recentrecruit, has also been subjected to a campaign of harassment and allegedly threatened: “Receiving support in private but fearful of doing it public [sic] due to bullying by dominate [sic] Puritan & Islamist voices”, he recentlywroteon Facebook.“Attacks against Quilliam Foundation are crude guilt by association arguments.

2950553856,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2014/08/22/Doctors-Without-Borders-Senior-Official-International-Response-to-Ebola-Has-Been-Almost-Zero,Doctors Without Borders Senior Official: International Response to Ebola 'Almost Zero',"The operations director of Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), Brice de la Vigne, has described the international efforts to stop the spread of the Ebola virus as “almost zero,” arguing that there is a lack of “political will” to stop the virus in West Africa, as most countries are simply working to keep the virus out of their own territories.According toThe Guardian, de la Vigne blasted the commitment of the international community to fighting the virus, claiming little different was being done on the ground in West Africa to prevent the spread of the disease.“Globally, the response of the international community is almost zero,” he said to the newspaper, adding, “Leaders in the west are talking about their own safety and doing things like closing airlines–and not helping anyone else.”International governmental response has, for the most part, centered around containing the virus in West Africa. A number of Latin American nations, for example,have designated Ebola-only hospitalsand screening procedures at airports just in case the virus reaches the continent. In the United States, the focus has been on keeping passengers from West Africaout of the country, andtreating U.S. citizenswho contracted the virus in Africa.De la Vigne argues that this is not enough; nations must help contribute to building medical infrastructure in the affected countries–Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and, to a lesser extent, Nigeria–so that a viral outbreak of this magnitude does not happen again.“The solution is not that complicated but we need to have political will to do so. Time is running against us,” he explained. “But you need very senior people with high profiles, the kind of people who can co-ordinate a response to a million people affected by an earthquake.” He noted that both Liberia and Sierra Leone lost much of their medical infrastructure to civil war in the past decade, in addition to cultural issues that make it difficult for Western medical workers to gain the trust of locals.De la Vigne is joined by his organization’s president, Dr. Joanne Liu, in calling for greater international assistance against the Ebola outbreak.In an editorial inTimemagazine, Liu argues that money alone from the international community will not be enough. “We need medical and emergency relief workers to trace those who may be infected, to educate people about protection measures and to work in treatment centers.” she states. “Many more people are needed in the field, right now.”Liu notes that the Ebola virus itself is but one problem; the “emergency within an emergency” that is the Ebola panic is also a threat, as it has caused deaths due to malaria and other diseases with similar symptoms. Hospitals will not treat these patients for fear that they may be carrying Ebola. Indeed, the first American death attributable to the Ebola virus, 24-year-old Nathaniel Dennis,did not have Ebola; he died of an unrelated illness after a hospital in Liberia refused to treat him.The Doctors Without Borders rebuke of the international community’s efforts in Africa follows news from the World Health Organization (WHO) that the current statistics regarding the Ebola outbreak are “vastly underestimated.” This results from long viral incubation periods and a lack of resources on the ground to keep track of infections and deaths. The WHO called the Ebola outbreak an “international health emergency”in a statementearlier this month."

Clay Doss, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet.This latest incident comes as the administration continues to negotiate a new trade deal with China to replace the ever-rising tariffs both countries have imposed on each other. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose billions of dollars in new tariffs if China doesn’t bend on trade talks.China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Geng Shuang later said the country’s navy “identified and warned off” the U.S. warships.“The relevant moves by the U.S. warships have infringed on China’s sovereignty and undermined peace and security in relevant waters,” the ministry said. “We firmly oppose that.”The United States does not acknowledge China’s territorial claims in those waters.“China urges the United States to stop these provocative actions,” Shuang said.An international tribunal in 2016 also discredited China’s claims.A similar encounter in the same waters in September forced a destroyer, the USS Decatur, to make a sharp maneuver to avoid colliding with a Chinese warship.The U.S. Navy routinely sends warships through the Taiwan Strait, which also angers Beijing."
4774414238,http://www.breitbart.com/news/islanders-advance-to-second-round-for-first-time-since-1993/,Islanders advance to second round for first time since 1993,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Barclays Center crowd was roaring during pregame introductions and through the early minutes of the game.After being quieted some while the New York Islanders trailed, they roared again when captain John Tavares tied it in the final minute of regulation and sent the fans into a frenzy after more than 30 minutes of overtime.Tavares’ fifth goal of the series, at 10:41 of the second extra period, gave New York a 2-1 victory in Game 6 on Sunday night, sending the Islanders to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 1993.Yes, their long postseason drought is finally over.“First and foremost for our fan base, they have been dying for this,” Tavares said. “No question, a lot of us haven’t been here that long but some of us have been here a while. … It’s time we had to get over this hump and push forward.”Since reaching the Wales Conference finals 23 years ago, the Islanders had seven first-round exits, including Game 7 losses on the road at Toronto in 2002 and at Washington a year ago. This was the Islanders’ first potential clinching game at home since the first round of the 1993 playoffs against the Capitals.“It’s been a long road, a lot of years of losing but this is incredible,” center Frans Nielsen said. “We had to work so hard for it. It is really satisfying sitting here right now the way we did it.”And they did it in their first year in their new Brooklyn arena after spending the franchise’s first 43 years at Long Island’s Nassau Coliseum.On the winning goal, Tavares skated in and fired an initial shot that Roberto Luongo saved, but the Islanders star got the rebound, wrapped around the net and stuffed the puck in before the diving goalie could get back. Tavares was quickly mobbed by his teammates after ending the longest home game in Islanders history.“When I got the rebound I realized how far he came out,” Tavares said. “I had a good step and just tried to — not take my time — but really make sure I had control of the puck. And obviously once you get around the net, make sure it goes in.”Thomas Greiss finished with 41 saves in the teams’ second straight two-overtime game and third in the series that went past regulation. The Islanders won Game 3 here 4-3 in the first extra period, and took Game 5 in Florida 2-1 at 16 minutes of the second OT.Now the Islanders will have a few days to prepare for Tampa Bay in the next round. The Lightning beat Detroit in five games.“It’s going to be a tough series,” defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. “We need to just keep playing the way we know we can and good things will happen.”Tavares tied it with just under 54 seconds left in the third period after New York defenseman Nick Leddy took the puck behind his own empty net, skated all the way down the right side and sent a centering pass from behind the Panthers’ goal. Nikolay Kulemin tried to tip it in, but Luongo dived to his left on top of it. But the puck trickled out from underneath him to his right, and Tavares swooped in to bury it.The Panthers have now lost four first-round series since reaching the Stanley Cup Final in 1996, with all their losses in this series coming by one goal.“I thought we had it with one minute left and we were so close to scoring the empty-netter,” the Panthers’ Jaromir Jagr said. “For a lot of guys it was their first playoff series and it’s different hockey. Most of the games we had a lead, we just didn’t close it.”Greiss gave up just 13 goals on 234 shots in the series for a 1.79 goals-against average and a .944 save-percentage.“He played great,” Capuano said. “You need goaltending and he came up big for us.”The Islanders controlled the play for most of the opening period, but the Panthers took the lead just before the closing minute of the period after New York turned it over in its own zone.Vincent Trochek sent a pass to Jonathan Huberdeau, who spun and fired a shot from the high slot while falling down with the puck going over Greiss’ blocker with 1:02 remaining. It was Huberdeau’s first goal of the series and marked the fifth time Florida scored first.___Follow Vin Cherwoo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/VinCherwooAP"
5312781310,http://www.breitbart.com/news/ap-source-trump-offers-flynn-national-security-adviser-job/,AP source: Trump offers Flynn national security adviser job,"NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump began building out his national security team Thursday, offering retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser. The move came as Trump made his most direct foray into foreign policy since the election, meeting with Japan’s prime minister.Flynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has advised Trump on national security issues for months. As national security adviser, he would work in the White House and have frequent access to the president.The official wouldn’t say whether Flynn had accepted the job. The official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly and insisted on anonymity.Trump held his first face-to-face meeting with a world leader since winning the presidential election, huddling privately with Japan’s Shinzo Abe. While Trump made no comments following the private meeting, Abe said the president-elect was “a leader in whom I can have great confidence.”Earlier Thursday, Trump consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sat down with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential contender to lead the State Department.Trump is a foreign policy novice and his early moves on national security are being closely watched by U.S allies and adversaries alike. He’s said to be considering a range of officials with varying degrees of experience to lead the State Department and Pentagon.Flynn, who turns 58 in December, built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. He retired in 2014 and has been a fierce critic of President Barack Obama’s White House and Pentagon, taking issue with the administration’s approach to global affairs and fighting Islamic State militants.In Washington, Vice President-elect Mike Pence huddled with Republican leaders in Congress. He then met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the newly elected leader of the Senate Democrats, seeking to convey respect as Democrats prepare for Republican rule of both chambers and the White House for the first time in a decade.“We look forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward,” Pence said outside Schumer’s Senate office.In a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans, Trump planned to meet with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Trump as a “con man” and a “fraud” in a stinging speech last March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a “loser.”The two began mending fences after Trump’s victory when Romney called with congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss Trump’s schedule publicly. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they were still “working on” the meeting.Trump’s actions Thursday aimed to show leaders both in the U.S. and overseas that he could soften his rhetoric, offer pragmatism in the White House and reaffirm longstanding American alliances. Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton last week, Trump has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone.Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, also visited the skyscraper and called Trump “a true friend of Israel.” He specifically cited as another “friend” Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, whose selection as a top White House adviser has created a backlash among Democrats. Bannon’s news website has peddled conspiracy theories, white nationalism and anti-Semitism.“We look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, in making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever,” Dermer said.Trump, a reality television star, business mogul and political newcomer, also rolled out new teams that will interact with the State Department, Pentagon, Justice Department and other national security agencies. The move is part of the government transition before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.Coordination had been on hold until Trump’s team submitted documents including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday, meaning agencies could start providing briefings and written materials to Trump’s team. Indeed, the departments of State, Defense and Justice say meetings are being set up.Conway said she expected initial announcements of Cabinet choices to come “before or right after Thanksgiving,” telling reporters Trump he was “loving” the transition. “He’s a transactional guy. He’s somebody who’s used to delivering results and producing.”One potential Cabinet member, Eva Moskowitz, said had taken herself out of the running to become education secretary. Moskowitz, a Democrat and advocate for charter schools, met with Trump this week, stoking speculation that she might inject a bit of bipartisanship in the new administration.Moskowitz, who voted for Clinton, suggested there were “positive signs” that Trump might govern differently than he campaigned, but she wrote in a letter to parents that many of her students, who are overwhelmingly black and Latino, would feel that “they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump’s campaign.”Trump’s calendar has been packed with sit-downs.During his meeting with Kissinger, who led the State Department under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, the two discussed relations with China, Russia, Iran and the European Union. Other meetings have included Haley, the daughter of Indian-born parents, who would bring diversity to a Trump administration, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling.___Thomas reported from Washington.

1025462410,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA3Q36D80,Iraq says it freed hundreds of inmates,"(AP) Iraq says it freed hundreds of inmatesBy ADAM SCHRECKAssociated PressBAGHDADIraq has begun setting free hundreds of inmates, officials said Monday, offering an apparent concession to Sunni protesters demonstrating against the country’s Shiite-led government.Protesters from Iraq’s Sunni minority have been rallying for more than three weeks against what they see as unfair treatment by the government against their sect.The release of detainees has been one of their main demands, and some of those freed Monday came from areas where anti-government unrest has surfaced.Sustained demonstrations against the government are rare in Iraq, and the size and staying power of the latest rallies are presenting a growing challenge to the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Many demonstrators are tapping into Arab Spring sentiments by demanding the downfall of the regime.The unrest is raising fears of a coming upsurge in sectarian bloodshed. Violence has dropped overall in Iraq since the nation neared a civil war several years ago, but attacks still happen frequently, usually in the form of Sunni militants targeting Shiites or security forces in an attempt to undermine the government’s authority.Iraqi authorities occasionally set free groups of inmates, but the latest move carried added significance because of the timing and high-profile nature of the release.Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani announced the releases at a ceremony at a Baghdad prison attended by dozens of detainees, including some dressed in bright yellow prison jumpsuits. Those being freed were handed boxed Qurans and showered with candy as television cameras rolled.“I hope that this will be an opportunity for you as Iraqis, who are keen to see the security and safety of the country and the stability of Iraq, to participate with us in spreading the spirit forgiveness and hope,” al-Shahristani said at the ceremony.Al-Shahristani, one of the prime minister’s most trusted political allies, oversees a government committee, formed earlier this month, that is charged with looking into protesters’ demands.He said 335 detainees have gained their freedom in the past week, but he did not give details on their backgrounds or alleged crimes. More will be released in the coming days, he said, and he encouraged citizens to come forward with details of detainees they believe are being unfairly held.While the vast western province of Anbar remains the focus of the demonstrations, rallies have erupted in several other predominantly Sunni areas as well.“I cannot wait to see my elderly father after five years in detention. We hope that the government will do more to end the suffering of the people in this country,” said Aziz Sami Awad as he awaited the release of his 77-year-old father, who was arrested during a raid in the northern suburbs of Baghdad in 2009.Iraq’s human rights minister, Mohammed Shiyaa, is a member of the committee headed by al-Shahristani. He said the panel is open to hearing all “legitimate demands of the protesters,” and he vowed to streamline the process of releasing detainees.Some of those who have recently been released had already finished their sentences but hadn’t yet been set free because of bureaucratic snags, while others were being held in pre-trial detention, he said. Many of them were detained as part of terrorism-related investigations.Those set free Monday included detainees from Mosul, Salaheddin and Anbar _ all areas that have witnessed recent protests, he said.___Associated Press writers Qassim Abdul-Zahra and Sameer N.

In late June of last year during his regular deliveries, he hid a knife, a jerrycan, and a stick and approached the home of the couple.He first strangled the 85-year-old woman to death, then used the knife and stick to kill her husband. Following the murder, the 55-year-old sprayed petrol around the house and lit it on fire. The bodies of the elderly couple were found shortly after.The case also had an Islamic extremist element to it as the court heard that the Tunisian had praised Islamic State and endorsed terror attacks carried out by the group. The 55-year-old even praised terror leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in court.Despite his praise for Islamic State, he was found not guilty of affiliation with a terror group.The trail follows several other high-profile homicides committed by migrants including several murders in Germany such as that of15-year-old Miain Kandel, and studentMaria Ladenburgerin Freiburg.The latest major case occurred earlier this month when 14-year-old Susanna F. of Mainz was murdered by 20-year-old asylum seeker Ali Bashar who fled to Iraq but was later apprehended and brought back to Germany afterconfessingto the murder while imprisoned by Kurdish forces.According to a recently released Heritage Foundation study,over 1,000 individualsin Europe have been killed or injured as a result of Islamist asylum seeker violence between January 2014 and December 2017.Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at@TomlinsonCJor email at ctomlinson(at)breitbart.com"
6355843371,http://www.breitbart.com/news/austrian-far-right-to-be-sworn-into-new-government/,Austrian far-right to be sworn into new government,"Vienna (AFP) – Austria’s far-right Freedom Party was set to be sworn in Monday as part of the Alpine country’s new government, rounding off a triumphant year for Europe’s nationalists.The new coalition was agreed on Friday by the conservative People’s Party (OeVP) and the FPOe, pledging to stop illegal immigration, cut taxes and resist EU centralisation.It will be led by Sebastian Kurz, who took over the OeVP in May and yanked it to the right, securing his party first place in October elections. At 31, Kurz will be the world’s youngest leader.At his side for the 1000 GMT investiture in the Hapsburg dynasty’s imperial palace in Vienna will be FPOe chief Heinz-Christian Strache, 48.Strache says Islam “has no place in Europe” and last year called German Chancellor Angela Merkel “the most dangerous woman in Europe” for her open-door refugee policy.On Sunday Strache trumpeted to his 750,000 followers on Facebook that the new government will slash benefits for asylum-seekers.“It will no longer happen for migrants who have never worked here a single day or paid anything into the social system to get thousands of euros in welfare!” he said, gaining 4,000 “likes”.Interior minister will be Herbert Kickl, a former speechwriter for Strache’s predecessor Joerg Haider, whose 2000 entry into government prompted an outcry and soul-seacrching in Europe that appears largely absent this time.Several different demonstrations have been called for Monday in Vienna, although it was unclear how many people would show. Police have cordoned off the area around the presidency.The FPOe also secured the defence and foreign ministries, while the OeVP got finance, economy, justice, amongst other portfolios, and will continue to handle EU affairs.– Bumper year –Both Kurz and Strache won over voters two months ago by stoking concerns about immigration following a record influx in 2015, mirroring elections elsewhere in Europe this year.Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party became the second-largest in the Netherlands, Marine Le Pen of France’s National Front was in a runoff for the presidency and Alternative for Germany entered the Bundestag.But the FPOe is rare in western Europe in having translated ballot box success into real power.Speaking at a far-right congress in Prague on Saturday, Wilders said the FPOe’s entry into government was “an excellent result”. Le Pen called it “very good news for Europe”.“Every election demonstrates a form of rejection of the European Union,” Le Pen said, echoing the euroscepticism has also been shown by the FPOe in the past.– Pro-EU –Kurz and Strache both stressed on Saturday however that the new government was staunchly pro-EU and that their plans for more Swiss-style “direct democracy” excluded a referendum on EU membership.But Kurz said that during Austria’s presidency of the EU in the second half of 2018, Vienna would press for Brussels to have less say in areas that should be up to member states.Kurz said that the EU should be “stronger in big questions and which should step back on smaller issues”.Kurz also said that Austria would continue to support EU sanctions on Russia imposed over Ukraine, even though the FPOe, like other far-right groups, wants them lifted.However according to their joint programme, Austria will “actively work” towards easing the sanctions “in unison” with the rest of the EU.In addition the new government’s programme says that Austria will seek support to end “definitively” Turkey’s bid to join the EU, sparking anger on Sunday from Ankara."
7284471400,https://www.breitbart.com/news/no-4-irish-women-beat-no-3-louisville-to-win-acc-tourney/,No. 4 Irish women beat No. 3 Louisville to win ACC tourney,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Jessica Shepard snipped the net, then gave it a twirl over her head.That’s fitting — she and Notre Dame did some of their best work around the rim.Shepard had a season-high 30 points and 13 rebounds, and the fourth-ranked Fighting Irish claimed their fifth Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament title in six years by routing No. 3 Louisville 99-79 on Sunday.Tournament MVP Jackie Young added 21 points and 10 rebounds, Brianna Turner had 20 points and Marina Mabrey and Arike Ogunbowale scored 12 apiece for the top-seeded Irish (30-3).The defending national champs never trailed in beating the Cardinals for the second time this season and avenging their loss in last year’s ACC championship game — their only one in conference tournament play since joining the ACC in 2013-14.“When you beat ranked teams by as much as we did this weekend, I think it sends a great message” to the rest of the nation, coach Muffet McGraw said.Notre Dame outscored Louisville 72-40 in the paint and built a 44-29 rebounding edge. The Cardinals didn’t have one key player to start the game, lost another and frequently used a four-guard lineup.“Coming into the game, we knew we had a mismatch,” Shepard said. “The guards did a great job of passing the ball inside. … You can just throw it up to the rim and watch (Turner) get it.”Bionca Dunham scored 18 points and ACC player of the year Asia Durr finished with 15 for the second-seeded and short-handed Cardinals (29-3). The ACC’s second-best 3-point-shooting team shot a season-worst 11 percent from long range and missed all 12 3s they tried over the final 25 minutes.“This is not our final goal,” Durr said. “We’ve just got to learn from it and continue to push forward.”BIG PICTURELouisville: Only one of the Cardinals’ three senior mainstays — Durr — lasted until the end of this one, partly explaining their struggles in the paint. Arica Carter, who scored 16 points in a semifinal win over No. 9 North Carolina State, was out with a leg injury and coach Jeff Walz said he found out 20 minutes before tipoff that she couldn’t go. Then, leading rebounder Sam Fuehring injured an ankle early in the second quarter and played only two minutes in the second half.“I wasn’t willing to sacrifice (Fuehring) being able to play in 2½ weeks when the big tournament starts up,” Walz said.Notre Dame: Young had said that 74-72 loss to Louisville in last year’s title game stuck with the Irish — even as they got the last laugh last April by winning the program’s second national title. They won three games this weekend by an average of 21 points to improve to 17-1 all-time in this tournament.“We came in with a goal of bringing the trophy back to South Bend,” McGraw said, “and I felt like we played really well in every game.”STAT SHEETThe ACC’s most productive offense once again carved up its best defense. Notre Dame, which averages a league-best 88.7 points, hung at least 80 points on Louisville for the second time after beating the Cardinals 82-68 exactly two months earlier in a 1-vs.-2 matchup. Louisville had allowed 80 points only one other time — in the opener against Western Kentucky.QUICK SHOTSShepard’s previous season best of 28 points came in the opener against Harvard on Nov. 9. . Notre Dame’s 27 points in the first quarter were the most allowed by Louisville in that quarter all season. . The Cardinals, who trailed 48-39 at halftime, have not overcome a halftime deficit of more than three points this season.UP NEXTLouisville: Headed to the NCAA Tournament — possibly as a No. 1 seed.Notre Dame: Headed to the NCAA Tournament — likely as a No. 1 seed, perhaps in the Chicago Regional.___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"

McMaster originally had in mind, thank God, which was 50,000 more U.S. troops in Afghanistan,” he said. “He didn’t, in the end, as you know, explicitly endorse a number.”“In fact, he made some significant changes from the previous administration’s approach by saying we’re going to try to win, which is really a breakthrough,” Gaffney continued. “We’re going to make this condition-based, not arbitrarily aligned with some projections of the numbers of the amount of time they should be there. They’re going to stay until the job is done. All of that, I think, is an improvement over the previous administration if you think that we need to have a continuing presence in Afghanistan.”Gaffney told Kassam he comes down “rather more closely to theapproach that my friend Erik Princeand others have recommended, which is to reduce the American footprint – not abandon the place but greatly reduce the number of uniformed military personnel and the expense associated with trying to defeat the Taliban, and the Islamic State, and al-Qaeda, and who knows who all else at the moment who are operating once again from Afghan soil.”“Do it with a small number of CIA personnel and some contractor support, basically backing up, and helping to lead, and helping to train, and helping to discipline, and helping to make more effective Afghan forces than we have proven to do thus far with this big army, big footprint approach,” he recommended.Gaffney noted that if the conditions laid out by President Trump are never satisfied, his plan could devolve into another perpetual open-ended deployment.“I think the reason you’ve seen so many military folks come forward and say ‘we like this approach’ is that it just wasn’t as capricious as what Obama was doing,” he said. “There was no rhyme or reason to what he was announcing – a surge one day, and we’re going to pull them out by such-and-such a date, without regard for the conditions on the ground.”“Clearly that’s unsatisfactory,” he said of Obama’s approach. “That’s a formula for what we’ve had thus far, really, which is a meat grinder of our personnel with no appreciable results to show for it, other than I think emboldening the sharia supremacists who have taken great heart from the fact that they defeated one super-power, the old Soviet Union, and are quite confident they are on their way to defeating a second one.”Gaffney said one of his biggest concerns is that “you don’t want to be emboldening these guys.”“They already think it’s Allah’s will that they will triumph worldwide,” he explained. “Creating the impression in their heads that the jihad is working, that they will triumph, that they will not only triumph in Afghanistan but that they will triumph globally, is exactly the wrong signal to be sending.”“What history has taught us about this phenomenon – and I think it’s best described, as Andy McCarthy does, as ‘sharia supremacism’ – is that if they think they’re with the winning horse, if they think that the jihad is proving successful, there’s no end of it. The only end of it, the only way to prevent it, is to prevail upon them that they will be destroyed. Not every single last one of them, of course, but enough of them to make it real obvious that this isn’t a winner, and they’re going to have to stop or be destroyed themselves,” he said.Gaffney answered in the affirmative when Kassam asked if Obama’s strategy was excessively influenced by domestic politics and electoral considerations.“He had run on a platform that he was going to get us out of Iraq, and he was going to win the ‘good war,’ as he put it, Afghanistan,” Gaffney recalled. “So he was throwing people in, but he also recognized that this was going to be a loser for his constituency, so he was going to make it for a finite time period, without regard for the actual conditions on the ground.”“Are we in a time where people have just sort of accustomed themselves to having troops there and having expenditures there?” he asked. “It’s between elections, so it’s a little hard to say at the moment. I tend to think that one of the reasons that Donald Trump was elected president was he said we’re going to stop doing this sort of thing. So to the extent he is president, to the extent his base wanted him to stop doing this sort of thing, I’m not persuaded that this is going to sit all that well.”When Kassam asked if Trump would be more likely to pull out, or to send even more troops, if the current strategy fails, Gaffney said President Trump has “opened the door” for more dramatic changes to Afghanistan policy in the future.“The way he formulated this, the way he steered clear of setting some specific numbers of U.S. military personnel that were going to be added, or were going to be maintained, or for how long and all that, definitely seems to me it contemplates the transition from this kind of, well, failed model. Let’s be clear – it hasn’t worked for 16 or 17 years,” Gaffney said.“What worked initially, we should recall, was something very like what Erik Prince talked about. We used CIA personnel, we used contractor support, we used air power – and some military capabilities, of course – and we destroyed the Taliban early on in this Afghan campaign. Then we went on to try to occupy the place, and to nation-build, and to turn it into a functioning democracy, and so on,” he recalled.“With all the corruption, with the loss of life, with the expenditure of national treasure, my guess is the American people come the next election will say, ‘We don’t want to be doing this anymore,’” Gaffney anticipated.“The Prince model, if you will, is an alternative that I think avoids losing, which I think most Americans will realize is not in our interests – but avoids also the meat grinder, the waste of lives and treasure that can and needs to be avoided, it seems to me, while we try to prevent this return of a sort of caliphate in Afghanistan, and the message that it sends to a lot of other people you want to dissuade from thinking they can win,” he said.Gaffney said Trump was correct to call out Pakistan for its role in perpetuating the Taliban insurgency.“If we allow Pakistan to continue to do what it’s doing, which is absolutely to subvert the Afghans and our interests in Afghanistan, and to promote the Taliban, and to enable other sharia supremacists to get in there and to operate with impunity, and to do the same from Pakistani soil, and to threaten India, and to proliferate nuclear weapons and missile technology and the like, that is a problem,” he warned.“I think the president was absolutely right to call them out. I think he’s absolutely right to signal a very strong switch to an intensified relationship with Pakistan’s longtime adversary India. It remains to be seen, again, how all of this is actually implemented, but it seems to me at least at the broad strategic level, that’s the right thing to be doing,” Gaffney said.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern."

(AP) — Ted Cruz cinched double-barreled victories in Kansas and Maine, and battled Donald Trump for Kentucky in Saturday’s four-state round of Republican voting, fresh evidence that there’s no quick end in sight to the fractious GOP race for president.Kansas Democrats gave Bernie Sanders a win, as voters in three states chose between the Vermont senator and Hillary Clinton.“God bless Kansas,” Cruz declared during a rally in Idaho, which votes in three days. “The scream you hear, the howl that comes from Washington D.C., is utter terror at what we the people are doing together.”The Texas senator defeated Trump by more than a 2-to-1 margin in Kansas, and early returns showed he and Trump were in a tight races for Kentucky. Cruz, a tea party favorite, attributed his strong showing to conservatives coalescing behind his candidacy, calling it a “manifestation of a real shift in momentum.”With the GOP race in chaos, establishment figures frantically are looking for any way to derail Trump, perhaps at a contested convention if no candidate can get enough delegates to lock up the nomination in advance. Party leaders — including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain — are fearful a Trump victory would lead to a disastrous November election, with losses up and down the GOP ticket.“Everyone’s trying to figure out how to stop Trump,” the billionaire marveled at an afternoon rally in Orlando, Florida, where he had supporters raise their hands and swear to vote for him.Despite the support of many elected officials in Kansas, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio came up short, raising serious questions about his viability in the race. Cruz suggested it was time for some Republican candidates to quit the race.In Maine, Cruz won a comfortable margin over Trump. Republicans also were voting in Louisiana on Saturday.On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Kansas party officials announced that Sanders had won the state’s caucuses, but did not release a tally of the vote. Democrats also were voting Saturday in Nebraska and Louisiana.With Republican front-runner Trump yet to win states by the margins he’ll need in order to secure the nomination before the GOP convention, every one of the 155 GOP delegates at stake on Saturday was worth fighting for.Count Wichita’s Barb Berry among those who propelled Cruz to victory in Kansas, where GOP officials reported extremely high turnout. It was Cruz’ fifth win of the nominating race. Cruz had won Alaska, Oklahoma, Iowa and his home state of Texas.“I believe that he is a true fighter for conservatives,” said Berry, a 67-year-old retired AT&T manager. As for Trump, Berry said, “he is a little too narcissistic.”It was anger that propelled many of Trump’s voters to the polls.“It’s my opportunity to revolt,” said Betty Nixon, a 60-year-old Trump voter in Olathe, Kansas. She said she liked the businessman because “he’s not bought and paid for.”Overall, Trump had prevailed in 10 of 15 contests heading into Saturday’s voting. Rubio had one win in Minnesota.Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich both pinned their hopes on winner-take-all contests on March 15 in their home states.On the Democratic side, Clinton hoped that strong support among African-Americans in Louisiana would propel her to victory. Vermonter Sanders, trailing far behind Clinton in the delegate count, had higher hopes of making progress in Nebraska and Kansas, where the Democratic electorate is less diverse.Tara Evans, a 52-year-old quilt maker from Bellevue, Nebraska, said she was caucusing for Clinton, and happy to know that the former first lady could bring her husband back to the White House.“I like Bernie, but I think Hillary had the best chance of winning,” she said.Heading into Saturday’s voting, Clinton had 1,066 delegates to Sanders’ 432, including superdelegates — members of Congress, governors and party officials who can support the candidate of their choice. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the Democratic nomination. There were 109 at stake on Saturday.Clinton and Sanders both campaigned in Michigan, a sign of the importance both attach to the state’s primary on Tuesday.Clinton met with about 20 African-American ministers in Detroit and said “the future” of the Supreme Court was on the ballot in November’s general election.Sanders, at a rally in suburban Warren, stressed his opposition to “disastrous” trade agreements that he said cost U.S. jobs. He’s hoping his emphasis on reducing income inequality plays well in a state hit hard over the years by shifting economic trends and globalization.In the overall race for GOP delegates, including partial results for Kansas, Trump led with 338 and Cruz had 254. Rubio had 115 delegates and Kasich had 25.Cruz will collect at least 23 delegates for winning the Republican caucuses in Kansas, Trump at least nine and Rubio at least five.It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination for president.___Benac reported from Washington.

7110840464,https://www.breitbart.com/news/interior-secretary-latest-high-profile-trump-admin-departure-2/,Interior secretary latest high-profile Trump admin departure,"Washington (AFP) – Donald Trump said Saturday that his interior secretary will be leaving soon — the latest in a series of high-profile departures from an administration beset by turnover and alleged ethical failings.Zinke’s exit will remove the distraction of the ethical issues that have dogged him — and that reportedly have annoyed Trump — but is unlikely to mark a shift away from the concerted environmental deregulation that took place during the secretary’s tenure at the Interior Department.“Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke will be leaving the Administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years,” Trump wrote on Twitter, highlighting the fact that Zinke’s tenure was substantially longer than that of some other former top officials in the administration.“Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,” the president said, adding that a replacement would be announced next week.The interior secretary is responsible for overseeing conservation and mineral extraction on public land that, if stitched together, would be larger than Mexico.Zinke tied his departure to the burden of “false allegations” against him.“I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations. It is better for the President and Interior to focus on accomplishments rather than fictitious allegations,” he said in a statement on Twitter.Zinke, a former Montana congressman, has been the subject of various investigations linked to his real estate holdings in his home state and his actions in office, making him a lightning rod for complaints from Democrats.They expressed no regrets over his impending departure.– ‘Staggering ethical abuses’ –“Ryan Zinke was one of the most toxic members of the cabinet in the way he treated our environment, our precious public lands, and the way he treated the govt like it was his personal honey pot,” tweeted Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.“The swamp cabinet will be a little less foul without him.”Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker of the House of Representatives, also offered a harsh assessment.“Secretary Zinke has been a shameless handmaiden for the special interests,” she said in a statement.“His staggering ethical abuses have delivered a serious and lasting blow to America’s public lands, environment, clean air and clean water,” she said.Zinke’s planned departure will see him leave office before the newly Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is seated, meaning he will avoid the threat of legislative investigation come January.Along with Trump’s first environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt — who resigned in July amid a series of scandals over ethical lapses and lavish spending — Zinke helped spearhead a presidential push to sharply relax environmental regulations and expand energy production.The Zinke announcement came just a week after another impending high-profile departure — that of Trump’s chief of staff John Kelly — was made public.– Riding with Pence –Trump on Friday tapped Mick Mulvaney — the director of the Office of Management and Budget — to serve as chief of staff on an acting basis, setting him up to be the third person to hold the post since the president took office in early 2017.A series of other top officials have left the Trump White House, including a secretary of state, two national security advisors and an attorney general, as well as Pruitt.Zinke is one of several members of Trump’s cabinet to come under fire over expenditures, including reports that his department was spending nearly $139,000 to upgrade three sets of double doors in his office — a cost he later said he negotiated down to $75,000.He had been the subject of some 15 investigations, including one for taking a government security detail with him on a vacation trip to Turkey, according to The Washington Post.He has also faced criticism over costly US Park Police helicopter flights last year that allowed him to return to Washington for a horseback ride with Vice President Mike Pence, and several other flights on non-commercial aircraft.Zinke, a former Navy SEAL who wore cowboy boots to the office and carried himself with a Western swagger, seemed to emulate Trump when under fire, lashing back rather than retreating.Last month, when a Democratic congressman said it was time for new leadership at the Interior Department, Zinke suggested in a tweet that his critic had a drinking problem.“It’s hard for him to think straight from the bottom of the bottle,” he wrote, a comment that many in Washington thought crossed a line."

Putin added that U.S. participation is essential for the success of global efforts.___3 p.m.President Vladimir Putin has urged U.S. businessmen to use their influence to help normalize Russia-U.S. relations.Speaking at an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Putin said relations between Moscow and Washington are now at their lowest point since Cold War times.During a panel meeting, Putin called on the U.S. participants of the forum to “help restore a normal political dialogue … help a newly elected president and new administration.”He also pledged to help improve conditions for U.S. business in Russia.Russia’s hopes for better ties with President Donald Trump’s administration have been dashed by the congressional and FBI investigations into the Trump campaign’s ties with Russia."

And riding onto the nation’s movie screens this weekend is a perfect example of just that kind of film: the new Western/sci-fi hybrid genre mash-up “Cowboys & Aliens.”The “plot” couldn’t be more basic, yet it took nine people to assemble the script, which opens on tough-guy cowboy Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) waking up in the desert with a nasty gash in his belly and a mysterious iron bracelet on one arm.[youtube oXHhnT1tHNM nolink]As he struggles to remember what led to his desert awakening, Jake is confronted by three horsemen who threaten to turn him in for a bounty.   He still can’t remember his name or where he came from, but he does know how to open a can of whupass on the interlopers and proceeds to kill them before riding into the nearest town wearing their clothes and riding their horses.When he finds that the town is ruled by the terroristic clan of corrupt cattle rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), he proceeds to stir things up by humorously beating Woodrow’s son and henchmen. Just as he’s about to have to run for his life or fight to the death with Woodrow, however, a fleet of alien spaceships comes swooping in out of nowhere to blow a bunch of stuff up for no immediately apparent reason – and Jake and Woodrow have to team up and bring their respective posses together to fight back against the aliens with one cohesive force.Before you wonder if the idea of combining the gangs to stop an outside force is an exercise in kumbaya multiculturalism, let me assure you that this is a rare case where Hollywood just lets a film play by its own rules, with no agenda to be found anywhere. The two posses are made up of middle-aged white men just because that was the norm back in the days of the segregated Old West, and at a few points there are even touching or haunting moments in which a character named Doc asks the town preacher about the meaning of his life and the suffering he has endured, as well as a touching turnaround in which the Doc makes sure the preacher is treated with respect and proper prayers when he dies.And it’s also cool to see Craig find inventive ways to beat the crap out of people and shoot them from unexpected angles, enabling him to cut loose in a way his reserved James Bond character rarely can. Ford, meanwhile, pulls off his first fun non-Indiana Jones role since 1997’s “Air Force One,” and while it’s obvious that Craig and Ford are having a blast bad-mouthing and punching each other across some impressive Western vistas, this doesn’t quite add up to the jaw-droppingly entertaining genre mashup that it should be.Instead, it seems to drag at times while director Jon Favreau (“Iron Man”) finds ways to shoehorn the under-developed yet frightening aliens (who bear way too much resemblance to the creatures in the “Alien” series, and are a bit too blatantly CGI amid the vibrantly real locations the cowboys ride through).But the fact that I was able to maintain a goofy smile and chuckle throughout does count for something. It may not be a great Western like “Shane” nor a sci-fi classic on the level of the “Alien” series, but “Cowboys & Aliens” offers an amusing oasis for weary viewers to drink from amid a summer film schedule filled with parched ideas and countless sequels. If you can’t help grinning over the concept alone, you’ll probably enjoy it. And if you think it sounds stupid, this film definitely isn’t for you."

7259244852,https://www.breitbart.com/news/australian-cardinal-challenges-custody-after-child-sex-crimes-conviction/,Australian cardinal challenges custody after child sex crimes conviction,"Melbourne (AFP) – Angry protesters called Cardinal George Pell a “maggot” and a “monster” Wednesday as he arrived in court, possibly for the last time as a free man, in a last-ditch push for bail while he appeals his historic conviction for child sex crimes.Once among Pope Francis’ closest advisors and the most senior Catholic cleric ever convicted of child sex crimes, Pell is facing up to 50 years in prison on five charges of sexual and indecent assault on two choirboys in 1996-97.He is expected to be remanded in custody after the pre-sentencing submissions in court, but his lawyer plans to apply for bail later in the day before the Court of Appeal.A large crowd confronted the Cardinal outside the County Court of Victoria in Melbourne, with supporters of other abuse survivors jostling the 77-year-old and yelling: “You’re a maggot, Pell, you rot in hell.”“You’re the devil. You’re evil… You’re a paedophile. You’re a criminal. You’re a monster. May you rot in hell,” one protester shouted.Shortly before Wednesday’s hearing, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti announced on Twitter that Pell had been removed from his position as chief of Vatican finances, the third-most powerful position in the Church.The Vatican said earlier it had “utmost respect” for the Australian justice system following the “painful news” of Pell’s conviction.The Cardinal was found guilty in December of assaulting the two choirboys in the sacristy of Melbourne’s Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, but the verdict was only revealed Tuesday after a second trial against him was abandoned by prosecutors, allowing a gag order to be lifted.He was due to be remanded in custody in December but that was delayed until the pre-sentencing hearing as his lawyer said he required urgent double knee surgery.Pell has already appealed the verdict and his lawyer told the court Tuesday it would be based on three grounds — that the jury verdict was unreasonable, that an animation showing movements of people in the cathedral on the day of the alleged abuse was rejected, and that there were issues with how the jury was formed.Pell is expected to be sentenced in the next two weeks.– Civil suit –The Court of Appeal process, which could last up to a year, will see a bench usually made up of three judges review the same evidence that the jurors were presented with in the earlier trial.Criminal law expert Jeremy Gans of the University of Melbourne told AFP the judges could question the jury’s conclusions based on the fact that the case was based on only one person’s — the surviving victim’s — testimony.The other choirboy, who died of a drug overdose in 2014, had never told his parents he was abused.During the trial, the court had heard that Pell abused the two boys after catching them swigging from a bottle of sacramental wine. He exposed himself and forced one of them to perform oral sex on him, and fondled the boy’s genitals while masturbating.His legal team argued the cathedral sacristy was a hive of activity following Sunday mass and “only a madman” would commit such acts after such a busy time.The Catholic Church meanwhile could face a civil suit from the father of the deceased victim, who said via his lawyer Tuesday that the cleric had “blood on his hands”.He said his son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, turned to drugs as a teenager to cope with the trauma and also suffered from PTSD.“We are looking at what knowledge the Church might have had in relation to what was happening,” the lawyer, Leanne McDonald, told AFP."

The party, which is often billed as ‘the German Ukip’, has seen a surge in support thanks to its policies advocating controlled immigration.The party has been steadily climbing in the polls for the last few months, as disquiet grows in Germany over the government’s open doors policy on immigration. As many as 1 million migrants are expected to come to Germany this year, placing huge pressure on services and social cohesion.Following the attacks in Paris, perpetrated by at least one, perhaps as many as three terrorists who used the migrant flow across Europe as cover for their movements into France, support for AfD has risen again, allowing the party to overtake its Green Party rivals and claim third place.In a poll by INSA forBild, the two sister parties, Chancellor Angela Merkel’sChristian Democratic Union of Germany(CDU) and their traditional partners theChristian Social Union in Bavaria(CSU), still hold the number one spot, taking 35 percent of voter support. That result represents an increase of one percent on the previous week’s polling.Their partner in Germany’s ruling ‘grand coalition’, centre-leftSocial Democratic Party of Germanyhasn’t fared so well and has slipped to 23.5 percent, although that leaves it comfortably in second place.But creeping up behind isAfD, now on 10.5 percent. That result knocks the Greens, now on 10 percent, into fourth place, while bringing up the rear is the classically liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), who slipped one point to land on five percent.Hermann Binkert, the head of INSA toldBild: “Following the terrorist attacks, the union has received more support,” adding that the result represents a “stabilisation” of their polling figures, following a period of reduced support. He put it down to the notion that, after shocks such as the attack in Paris, voters “tend towards the party of government.”The headline figures may mask underlying disquiet however. A mid-October poll also by INSA found that one in three German wanted Chancellor Merkelto resignover her handling of the migrant crisis. As Mrs Merkel has dug her heels in this week, insisting that the first duty of Western governments was to provide refugees with“hope”,that figure is only set to rise.Follow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter:Follow @Donna_R_Eor e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com"
4775894730,http://www.breitbart.com/news/the-latest-merkel-says-leaders-discuss-support-for-libya/,The Latest: Merkel says leaders discuss support for Libya,"VIENNA (AP) — The Latest on the flow of migrants into Europe (all times local):7:00 p.m.German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she, U.S. President Barack Obama and the leaders of France, Britain and Italy have discussed ways of supporting the fragile unity government in Libya and the possibility of expanding military efforts to stop the smuggling of migrants across the Mediterranean.Speaking after talks in Hannover on Monday, Merkel said that NATO was already patrolling for smugglers in the Aegean Sea, between Greece and Turkey.She emphasized there were no “concrete proposals” for a similar mission off Libya and that a European Union operation in the Mediterranean had been working “quite well.”  But, she said, Obama has assured the European leaders the U.S. was prepared to also “take responsibility with regard to the Mediterranean route from Libya if necessary.”___6:45 p.m.Greece’s coast guard says authorities in the western Greek port of Patras have arrested a truck driver after finding 11 migrants hiding in a compartment hidden in the vehicle’s cargo of oranges.The coast guard said Monday the 58-year-old driver was arrested the previous day on suspicion of attempting to smuggle the migrants abroad. Patras is Greece’s main port for ferries to and from neighboring Italy.Nearly 54,000 migrants and refugees are stranded in Greece since Europe closed its land borders to the massive refugee flow heading north to the more prosperous countries of central and northern Europe.___6:30 p.m.Greece’s coast guard says it rescued a total of 304 refugees and migrants at sea in eight separate operations over the last week, from April 18-25.The coast guard said Monday it had also arrested one suspected migrant smuggler and seized four boats used to ferry people to the Greek islands from the nearby Turkish shore.The number of refugees making the short but often dangerous crossing from Turkey to the eastern Aegean islands has dropped significantly since a European Union-Turkey deal came into effect last month.Under the deal, those arriving from March 20 onwards face being returned to Turkey unless they successfully apply for asylum in Greece — which few want to do. The deal has been heavily criticized by human rights groups, who say it violates the rights of refugees and that Turkey is not a safe country to return them to.___5:15 p.m.Queen Rania of Jordan has visited refugees and migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos, which has been one of the main gateways into Europe for people fleeing war, poverty and persecution at home.Rania visited the Kara Tepe camp on Monday, a municipal-run facility hosting more than 800 people. Jordan is currently home to more than 1.2 million Syrians.Rania says aid organizations had voiced “deep concern” over the recent European Union-Turkey deal under which those arriving on Greek islands after March 20 face deportation back to Turkey. She says it is “absolutely crucial for us to look for legal alternatives and more safe and effective pathways to Europe and to areas of safety.”She also says authorities need to search for sustainable, long-term solutions to the migrant crisis.___2:35 p.m.Poland’s Interior Ministry says it will send 120 border guards, police and migration bureau officers to Greece to help protect the European Union’s borders under the mass inflow of refugees.A communique on the ministry website said Monday that due to the “continuing migration crisis in Europe,” 60 Border Guard officers and 40 police officers with the necessary equipment will soon support Europe’s border protection agency, Frontex, in securing Greece’s border, which is also the EU’s external border.A further 20 experts of Poland’s Office for Foreigners will help with processing the migrants’ requests for asylum.Poland is refusing to accept any refugees, citing security concerns after deadly attacks in France and Belgium.Warsaw argues support should be offered to refugees in camps nearest to their home countries.___2:10 p.m.Austria has re-imposed controls on its border with Hungary, with police checking vehicles at the main regular crossings and soldiers patrolling other stretches of the border.Police say the controls that began Monday are meant to ensure that no one crosses illegally and to prevent the smuggling of migrants into Austria and other EU nations. They have reported more such smuggling attempts into Austria since countries along the Balkan migration route closed their borders to migrants earlier this year.Before that, tens of thousands of migrants seeking better lives in prosperous EU countries came through Hungary and then through Austria until Hungary sealed its borders last September with razor-wire fences.Austrian police did not say how long the new border controls would remain."

Why? Because it exposes how the left first made Hollywood into the liberal colony it is today.At the birth of Hollywoodâs film industry, the entire enterprise was plagued with conflict. Municipal and state censorship boards, patent enforcers, and decency groups all threatened to block film producersâ from freely making and exhibiting their movies. To fight back against this opposition, the Hollywood studios of the time decided to join forces through trade associations, like the Motion Pictures Association of America (MPAA), to focus their defense. As trying as those early battles were, working together had a notable benefit for the studiosâ¦it created major roadblocks for all future newcomers. By the late 1920s, the film industry was already becoming anoligopolyâ where, through collusion, an industry reduces competition and eventually is dominated by a very small number of players. The barriers to entry have been so enduring and impenetrable that all of the major studios that exist today have their roots in this early era.With this near-monopolistic power, some abuses followed â including studio executives cheating writers out of screenplay credits. So in 1933, the Writers Guild of America, then known as the Screen Writers Guild, formed to establish criteria for doling out these important recognitions. On paper, the effort appeared laudable. However, the unionâs covert mission was far more Machiavellian â they wanted to control the supply of screenplays for the entire movie industry. If they controlled the documents on which movies were made, they could wield that power to force studios to submit to their demands â including control over film content. The problem wasâ¦the most active players in the Writers Guild were literally communists. Its first president was John Howard Lawson, who shortly after the formation of the guild was named the head of the Hollywood division of the Communist Party USA. He would later become one of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten.At the birth of Hollywoodâs film industry, the entire enterprise was plagued with conflict.

Writers under Lawsonâs thumb couldnât just freely writeâ¦they had to ask for permission fromThe Party. Lawson even reviewed screenplays before the studios. In one instance, when a screenwriter published an essay about how politics should stay out of their art â Lawson wrote a scathing rebuttal, entitled âArt is a Weaponâ, arguing that the writerâs thoughts betrayed Marxism. The offending screenwriter literally crawled to repent before Lawson and Dalton Trumbo at a Communist Party meeting.âIn Hollywood in the thirties, the Communist Party was barely distinguishable in policy and activities from the noncommunist Left,â claimed Sheila Schwartz in her 1982 bookThe Hollywood Writersâ Wars. After the Writers Guild won a prolonged fight against studios and the rivalScreen Playwrightsunion to be recognized as the sole union representing screenwriters, the radical left within the guild, who now were the ranking members, took the reigns. Many members started sensing this power shift, including Morrie Ryskind â legendary screenwriter of many Marx Brothers movies and a key player in winning studio recognition for the guild.âThe top honors for an unswerving [Writers Guild] commitment rightfully belong to that bloc in our midst who hoped to use the guild as the power base that would enable them to bring all facets of the motion picture industry under the control of one all-encompassing super union which would be controlled by and serve the purposes of the Communist Party,â said Morrie in his autobiographyI Shot an Elephant in My Pajamas. Now in control of the Writers Guild, the far-left began squeezing out those that didnât think like them. They were pioneering the greylist conservatives face today.âThe radical liberals were going to take over our business,â John Wayne once stated describing the environment at the time. âThey were getting themselves into a position where they could control who would do the writing.â Their power was so entrenched that one communist screenwriter, who witnessed his colleague crawl before Lawson to repent, wanted to quit The Party but didnât know how because, â[the communists] were placed in strategic positions throughout the industryâ¦withdrawal from them would have meant professional and economic suicide.âSo in 1944, Morrie Ryskind along with Walt Disney, Clark Gable, Cecil B. DeMille, Gary Cooper, and later John Wayne, formed the first Hollywood conservative group to fight the industryâs takeover by the radical left. Called theMotion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals(MPA) â in essence, the group was attempting to resist the future that Hollywood has become.

Stalin killed millions of his own citizens. The communist threat in America was greater than Islamic extremists today because many in power positions were aligned with their cause, including in Tinseltown. âThe Party [Hollywood communists] wholeheartedly embracedâ¦was pledging to overthrow the U.S. government, by force and violence if necessary,â states Morrieâs son Allan H. Ryskind. No wonder the rise of the hammer and sickle adorned Antifa seemed to be welcomed by some within Hollywood.Actor Orson Bean knows more than most about this era. The 89 year-old comedy icon found himself on the blacklist in the 1950s. He wasnât actually a Communist Party sympathizer â he considered himself a âlittle lefty.â But he attended a communist event because he was, in his words, âhorny for a Communist girlâ that wanted to go. âI wanted to show her I was politically aware,â he says, in his signature vocal flair. At the time, Orson was everywhere. He was a regular on the Ed Sullivan Show. He was acting in dramatic programs on television. CBS produced a pilot for an Orson Bean Show. But when his name hit the blacklist, all of that went away. He was banished from TV and film for a year.Orson is a case study in how the blacklist ensnared innocents. But even after his ordeal, he is clear on how the era got kicked off. âThe blacklist of people on the left grew out of a defacto blacklist of people on the right within the industry,â recalls Orson. âThere was communist directors, members of The Party, who only would cast you if you were also a member of The Party, or they were trying to woo you as a member of The Party. A lot of rightwing actorsâ¦were really furious at them. So when the Cold War happenedâ¦these rightwing actors, who had been seething for years about the way the communists were infiltrating the Hollywood business and were infiltrating the unions too, took their revenge. I donât think that storyâs ever been written because itâs not attractive for the Left.âOrson isnât alone in remembering this lost history.âMorrie Ryskind, who was a Pulitzer Prize winner, couldnât get a job because he didnât think exactly like these fellows,â recalled John Wayne.After testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee as a âfriendly witnessâ, the extraordinarily talented Morrie never received another offer from a studio again â and neither did other screenwriters that testified against communism in Hollywood. When the âofficialâ blacklist era ended, liberals continued where they left off â freezing out conservativesâ¦to far better effect.âI think thereâs a reverse blacklist, even today,â said director and Hollywood Ten member Edward Dmytryk inHollywood on Trial, a 1976 documentary about the blacklist. âI think that the liberals who are riding high, are going in the opposite direction. I think some of the fellas back then, who were on the reactionary side, are having a tough time getting jobs now.âThis greylist has been fully institutionalized. âThe Writers Guild of America, my union, is at a minimum 99 percent leftist liberal and, like me, socialist,â said screenwriter and MSNBC host Lawrence OâDonnell in 2003. In the wake of the blacklist era, the left gained complete control of La La Land using a tactic they now vilify on the big screen. In a sense, itâs a weird tribute to Morrie Ryskind, John Wayne, Cecile B. DeMille and the others concerned about how the far-left storytellers could use movies to rewrite history.âThe thing that I resent the most is that [the communists] are able to get into these unions, and take âem over,â stated Walt Disney to the House Un-American Activities Committee. âAnd I feel that they really oughta be smoked out and shown up for what they areâ¦â This was no light matter. More than even Hitler, Stalin killed millions of his own citizens. The communist threat in America was greater than Islamic extremists today because many in power positions were aligned with their cause, including in Tinseltown. âThe Party [Hollywood communists] embracedâ¦was pledging to overthrow the U.S. government, by force and violence if necessary,â states Morrieâs son Allan H. Ryskind. No wonder the rise of the hammer and sickle adorned Antifa seemed to be welcomed by some within Hollywood.Actor Orson Bean knows more than most about this era. The 89 year-old comedy icon found himself on the blacklist in the 1950s. He wasnât actually a Communist Party sympathizer â he considered himself a âlittle lefty.â But he attended a communist event because he was, in his words, âhorny for a communist girlâ that wanted to go. âI wanted to show her I was politically aware,â he says, in his signature vocal flair.

The co-founder ofVice Magazine, Gavin is unquestionably one of the funniest people on the planet. From the founding of Vice in 1994 until he left in 2008, its comedic voice washisvoice â and it was one that comedians wished to emulate. âTheir brand of humor is what I would do if there were no âstandards and practicesâ on TV,â said Jimmy Kimmel about Vice during Gavinâs helm.After leaving the magazine due to creative differences with his partners â he came up against Hollywoodâs liberal enforcers. âJimmy Miller is Dennis Millerâs brother. Heâs one of the biggest managers in comedy. He managed Will Ferrell, Jim Carey. He took a real shining to me after I left Vice,â says Gavin. âThings were going great. And then he found out I was right wing. He didnât âXâ me per se, but itâs exactly like being known as a pedophileâ¦no one likes a pedophile.â (Jimmy Miller did not respond to a request for comment.) Since the election of Trump, even with his star on the rise among the right and a new show onCRTV, his entertainment peers have become even more intolerant. âIâve lost 100% of my friends that are in comedy. Iâve lost 100% of my celebrity friends.âThis ploy keeping Hollywood a liberal bastion is subtle, but extraordinarily effective â smoke out right-wingers and their sympathizers, spread the word of their apostasy, freeze them out, repeat. This process is seen in every crevice of Tinseltown, and it quietly teaches a lesson to all watching.An early example of this was John Milius. The extraordinary screenwriter known forApocalypse Now,Conan the Barbarianand his gift with dialogue â including Dirty Harryâs âGo ahead, make my dayâ â became a target of liberal film critics after the success of his 1984 movieRed Dawn, which showed communists as villains. Set in an alt-history where the Soviet Union raids the U.S., the invaders are defeated by armed high school students in a bloody ground war.âBeing not a communist is grounds for dismissal now,â says Gavin McInnes about being a right-winger in showbiz.

7251336224,https://www.breitbart.com/news/venezuela-set-for-aid-showdown-as-guaido-claims-military-help/,Venezuela set for aid showdown as Guaido claims military help,"Cúcuta (Colombia) (AFP) – Venezuela braced for a showdown between the military and regime opponents at the Colombian border on Saturday, when self-declared acting president Juan Guaido has vowed humanitarian aid would enter his country despite a blockade.Socialist leader Nicolas Maduro has vowed not to allow in the aid, which he’s dismissed as a show and pretext for a US invasion.Humanitarian aid has become the centerpiece of the stand-off between Maduro and Guaido, the 35-year-old leader of Venezuela’s National Assembly who declared himself interim president exactly one month ago Saturday. Guaido has accused Maduro of rigging his re-election and is demanding a new vote.Venezuela is gripped by a humanitarian crisis that has seen poverty soar during years of recession.As many as 300,000 Venezuelans are in dire need of food and medicine after years of shortages and malnutrition, according to Guaido.United Nations figures show that some 2.7 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015 amid the crisis, and some 5,000 Venezuelans emigrate from their country each day.On the eve of the face-off Guaido defied a government ban on leaving the country and attended the “Venezuela Live Aid” concert organized by British billionaire Richard Branson just over the border in Colombia. The concert is aimed at raising funds to help the relief effort.Guaido sensationally claimed that the Venezuelan military, whose high command has repeatedly declared absolute loyalty to Maduro, “participated in this process” to get him into Colombia.Hours later, Caracas said it had closed much of the Colombian border, citing threats to Venezuela’s security.Guaido said that aid would come in on Saturday regardless of any military blockade.His supporters plan to drive the aid from Colombia into Venezuela at the closed border crossings supported by a flood of volunteers and accompanied by Catholic priests in an attempt to avoid arrest.Colombia and Venezuela share a 2,200 kilometer (1,370 mile) long border, and trucks carrying aid could also drive across some of the countless illegal dirt roads that link the two countries across the porous border.– Two killed –On Friday the tense stand-off turned deadly when two people were killed and 15 wounded as they tried to prevent Venezuelan troops from blocking an entry point on the Brazilian border.“An indigenous woman and her husband were killed and at least 15 other members of the Pemon indigenous community were injured,” said a local human rights group, Kape Kape.The clash occurred in southeastern Bolivar state close to the border with Brazil, which Maduro ordered closed on Thursday.Guaido called on the military to arrest those responsible for the killings, “or you will be responsible.”“It wasn’t a clash, it was an attack,” said Salomon Perez, who accompanied a brother and two nieces suffering from gunshot wounds by ambulance to a hospital in Brazil.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Venezuelan authorities to refrain from using lethal force against protesters.The United States “strongly condemns the Venezuelan military’s use of force against unarmed civilians and innocent volunteers” on the border with Brazil, the White House said. “The world is watching,” the statement added.Early Saturday two large trucks carrying eight tonnes of emergency aid left Boa Vista in Brazil en route to the Venezuelan border. The vehicles are driven by Venezuelans and escorted by Brazilian police, organizers said.– Battle of the bands –The “Venezuela Live Aid” concert, which featured some of the biggest names in Spanish-language music, was broadcast live online.Branson said he hopes to raise $100 million for humanitarian aid over the next 60 days via internet donations. Meanwhile aid is being stockpiled in Colombia, Brazil and the Caribbean island of Curacao because of Maduro’s ban.Guaido rallied his supporters when he showed up at the concert on Friday joined by Colombian President Ivan Duque, Chile’s Sebastian Pinera and Mario Abdo of Paraguay. The leaders greeted the crowd before the concert ended.Maduro’s rival concert, decidedly smaller and featuring Cuban and local artists, began hours later nearby on the Venezuelan side of the border in Urena.Performers took to the stage against a giant backdrop emblazoned with the words “#Trump Hands off Venezuela,” with around 2,500 people in attendance.“We don’t want to be interfered with, we don’t want to be invaded,” said Johana Suarez.Maduro said the event would last until Sunday.Maduro, who has support from China, Russia and the military high command, accuses the United States of plotting a military intervention.Moscow has blasted Washington for using aid as a “convenient pretext for conducting military action.”US special representative Elliott Abrams kept up the foreign pressure on Friday when he joined a Cucuta-bound plane carrying medical supplies and food.Peter Hernandez, a former Bolivarian National Guard member who fled Venezuela nine months ago and settled in Cucuta, told AFP that he was urging his ex-comrades “to think about your families, because that aid is… for everyone, and the Venezuelan people these days have great needs.”"
5449591646,http://www.breitbart.com/news/wounds-re-open-as-dylann-roofs-sentencing-nears/,Wounds re-open as Dylann Roof’s sentencing nears,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — In a courtroom a mile from the church slayings, wounds re-opened as nearly two dozen friends and relatives of the nine victims shared cherished memories and opined about a future without a mother, father, sister or brother.They shed tears and their voices shook, but none of them said whether Dylann Roof should face the death penalty or life in prison for gunning down the church members during a Bible study at Emanuel AME. That will be left up to the jury, which will begin its deliberations Tuesday after hearing a closing argument from prosecutors and perhaps Roof. He has represented himself during sentencing, but has not put up any fight for his life. He didn’t call any witnesses, present any evidence and so far has not asked for mercy.He did try to limit the amount of heart-wrenching testimony the jurors heard, but with only little success.Survivor Jennifer Pinckney talked about the life of her husband, church pastor and state Sen. Clementa Pinckney. She spoke about the harrowing minutes she spent huddled underneath a desk with her youngest daughter as shots rang out in the next room, unsure if the shooter was coming her way.In the hours that followed, the mother had to somehow explain the death to her two daughters.“I sat in front of the girls, and I basically told them that something had happened,” she said. “I think that that’s the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do.”The Rev. Anthony Thompson cried as he described a conversation with his wife, Myra, about their future plans to move and pursue studies and careers in the church.“She was my world, and she was gone,” he said.Survivor Felicia Sanders, who gave powerful testimony during the guilt phase of Roof’s trial, wrapped up prosecutors’ case Wednesday, talking about her creative, 26-year-old son, the youngest victim, and his commitment to his faith and Emanuel.“That night they were getting basic instruction before leaving Earth,” Sanders said. “I did not know that was going to be the life of them.”Law officers took the stand, too, reading from a journal found in Roof’s cell. In pencil, on lined paper, six weeks after his arrest, the then-21-year-old Roof wrote that he had “not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed,” scribbling white supremacy symbols and writing his thoughts about other races’ inferiority.The jury’s decision must be unanimous. If they are unable to agree, a life sentence is automatically imposed.___Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Markowicz told Reuters that she voted for former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2012, but voted for Trump in 2016 because she thought his business background and tough stance on illegal immigration would help job growth in Pennsylvania.“I really think they need to build a wall,” she said of Trump’s proposal to install a barrier along the Mexican border. “I think they need to send back all these people that aren’t supposed to be here, because they’re taking jobs from Americans.”While some Trump voters find it hard to support the president’s policies because of his controversialtweets, others say that it is his actions that matter more than his words.“Let’s set aside his personality. What about what he’s actually doing that is benefiting us?” said Loida Hopkins, a stay-at-home mother from Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, who also voted for Obama in 2012.Hopkins, a food stamp recipient and daughter of two illegal aliens, said she supported Trump in 2016 because of his stance against abortion. She said that unlike other welfare recipients, she is trying to better herself, and noted that her husband received a tax reform bonus from his company as a result of Trump’s policies.Belinda Miller, 50, of Audubon, Pennsylvania, also said she separates Trump’s policies from his rhetoric.“I look overall not at what he says but what he does. All that other stuff is just rhetoric, smoke, and mirrors,” said Miller, who works as an emergency room nurse.Miller said she benefited financially from Trump’s business-friendly policies, saying her retirement accounts grew as the stock market boomed.“My 401(k) and my 403 have soared and, if anybody doesn’t realize that, they’ve been asleep for a year,” she said.While many personalities in themediaand Democraticlawmakerscriticize Trump for his behavior, these Pennsylvania voters say their reasons for supporting Trump are based on his accomplishments while in office."

They were later identified as Chinese planes, and that they posed no military threat, Jeon said.Jeon said Seoul took “necessary measures in surveillance and strategy” in response to China’s planes, and that South Korea stands ready to respond to any incursions into exclusive South Korean airspace.The two planes flew southwest of South Korea’s Jeju Island, and after leaving KADIZ entered Japan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, or JADIZ.The planes flew over Tsushima Strait, an area between Korea and Japan before returning home, Kyodo News reported.The Mainichi Shimbun reported Japanese fighter jets were dispatched to respond to the Chinese flying operation, and that it’s likely the planes were on a mission to collect information on Japan’s Aegis-class destroyers.Japan is prepared to activate its “destroy on command” system should a North Korea missile enter Japanese airspace."

Mayor Vows to Move Forward with Exec Amnesty Implementation Even if Court Issues Injunction,"On Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said Los Angeles and other pro-amnesty cities are likely to file legal briefs in support of President Barack Obama’s executive amnesty. He also said even if there is an injunction against Obama’s executive amnesty, Los Angeles would continue its efforts to prepare eligible illegal immigrants to qualify for it.AtNational Journal‘s “Next America: Population 2043” event in Washington, D.C., Garcetti said even if the 25 states opposed to Obama’s executive amnesty win the first round in court, it is important for pro-amnesty cities to support Obama’s executive amnesty during the appeals process with an amicus brief. Los Angeles has partnered with other cities like Chicago and New York to better  implement Obama’s executive amnesty, and Garcetti said Los Angeles would “absolutely” move forward even if a court rules against executive amnesty because “we can’t afford not to.”Twenty-five states have joined a lawsuit against Obama’s executive amnesty while 12 statesjoined a briefin support of Obama’s executive amnesty.Federal Judge Andrew Hanen heard the case this week in Texas and said he would not issue a ruling on it before January 30.Garcetti said Los Angeles has already started programs to train librarians and teachers to identify children and families who may qualify for executive amnesty. He also said that children are important in the process since they may be better educated than their parents. Garcetti said that kids can “change the entire family’s legal outlook.”After claiming that executive amnesty will not cause more illegal immigration, Garcetti said his city is trying to “address the fears” of illegal immigrants by not honoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers if they do not come with a judge’s orders. He touted the city’s many multi-lingual programs and outreach to immigrant communities and claimed that illegal immigration is not “corrosive” to democracy and the economy.But when an audience member questioned whether illegal immigrants were taking jobs from Americans in his city, Garcetti mentioned that his city had to start programs to get more blacks in Los Angeles into the various trade professions because people who “couldn’t speak Spanish” were not able to find work as electricians and plumbers or in other trades."

In doing so, it let stand a lower court decision that said she had no legal grounds to file a defamation suit because she’s a limited public figure. She said in 2014 Cosby had raped her 30 years earlier. The suit said Cosby attorney Martin Singer repeatedly called her a liar in the press.Cosby, 81, is serving three to 10 years in a Pennsylvania prison for the 2004 assault of a different woman.The court also ruled Tuesday an intellectually challenged Texas man cannot receive the death penalty.

1006916657,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA3J156O0,NY county: Releasing gun names endangers public,"(AP) NY county: Releasing gun names endangers publicBy EILEEN AJ CONNELLYAssociated PressNEW YORKA New York county clerk justified his refusal to release the names and addresses of handgun permit holders to a newspaper, saying it would give stalkers and thieves a convenient roadmap to target potential victims _ and determine whether they have a gun.“This certainly puts my public in danger,” Putnam County Clerk Dennis Sant said Thursday following a news conference in which he was backed by the county executive and other elected officials.The Journal News, which serves New York City’s northern suburbs, sparked an outcry last month when it published clickable online maps with the names and addresses of pistol permit holders in Rockland and Westchester counties.When the newspaper requested the same information from Putnam, Sant initially said the county needed more time to fulfill the request. Sant balked entirely this week, saying the law gives him the prerogative to refuse to release public information if it endangers the public. Judges and police officers could be targeted by the people they put behind bars, he said. People with orders of protection have expressed concern to him about would-be attackers finding them through the database.While anyone can come into his office and file the necessary paperwork to request information on individual permits, Sant said the difference is that the Journal News plans to publish the information in a way that makes it accessible to everyone, instantaneously.“First of all, it tells criminals who doesn’t have a gun,” he said. “It gives a burglar or it gives a thief a map.”The Journal News’ database and accompanying story, “The Gun Owner Next Door,” was published as part of the newspaper’s coverage following the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. Some readers say it unfairly stigmatized gun owners, branding them in the same way as online maps showing where child molesters live. The newspaper says it received threats and has posted armed guards at its offices.Journal News Publisher Janet Hasson did not respond to several requests for comment Thursday but has issued statements previously standing behind the newspaper’s project and maintaining residents have a right to see such public information.Diane Kennedy, president of the New York News Publishers Association, said she reached out to Hasson offering support. She said editors may debate whether the Journal News should have published the database, but they fully backed the newspaper’s right to access public records under New York’s Freedom of Information Law. If the issue went to court, she said, member newspapers would file a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the Journal News.“It’s really clear cut,” Kennedy said. “The existing law doesn’t have exemptions in it. It says this information is subject to FOIL.”Rex Smith, editor of the Times Union in Albany, N.Y., said : “There is a broad consensus that the kind of resistance to the FOIL application that we’re seeing in Putnam County is intolerable.”The denial of similar information to The Wall Street Journal by New York City’s police commissioner led to a case that in 1981 was decided in favor of the newspaper.But Sant says that times have changed.“The technology today is so different,” he said. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity of bringing to the magistrates that this is not 30 years ago.”Several attempts to pass a law that would shield gun permit holders’ personal information have failed to pass the legislature in recent years.Experts say the county may have a difficult time defending the refusal, because New York state law classifies the data as public.“The argument has been made and rejected,” said Robert Freeman of the State Committee on Open Government. “There’s never been any indication that disclosure resulted in any jeopardy.”Edward S. Rudofsky, a New York attorney who specializes in the First Amendment, added, “I don’t see why technology makes this any more or less sensitive than it would otherwise be.”"

8564536609,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2021/05/31/dhs-mayorkas-drafts-roadmap-for-mass-migration/,DHS Mayorkas Drafts ‘Roadmap’ for Mass Migration,"President Joe Biden’s border officials are planning to dramatically expand legal migration into Americans’ workplaces, neighborhoods, and society, according to a May 31New York Timesarticle.“We want to take a broad approach toward opening up the legal avenues that have always been available but that [President Donald Trump’s officials] tried to put roadblocks upon,” one senior Biden appointeetoldtheNew York Times.The appointee, Felicia Escobar Carrillo, works for Alejandro Mayorkas, the pro-migration chief of the Department of Homeland Security. “There are significant changes that need to be made to really open up all avenues of legal immigration,” she said.But the Mayorkas plan is a direct challenge to the “tight labor market” plan endorsed by President Joe Biden in a May 28 speech.Bidensaid:Rising wages aren’t a bug; they’re a feature.  We want to get — we want to get something economists call “full employment.”  Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, we want employees to compete with each other to attract workers.  We want the — the companies to compete to attract workers.…Look, this isn’t just good for individual workers, it also makes our economy a whole lot stronger.  When American workers have more money to spend, American businesses benefit.  We all benefit.  Higher wages and more options for workers are a good thing.The Mayorkas plan may be curbed by Biden’s intervention. But it can also be curbed if GOP legislators deny funds and if pro-American groups file lawsuits to block abuses of migration-law loopholes.Americans already see the wage benefits of a tight labor market because of policies set by President Donald Trump in 2020.TheNew York TimesreportedMay 30 that federal agencies have “been issuing far fewer immigrant work visas during the pandemic thanks to travel and other restrictions, so employees from abroad who usually fill temporary help, agricultural and seasonal positions are missing from the labor market.” TheTimesadded:Teens are earning more than just fatter paychecks as employers try to lure applicants. Workers at Kennywood are receiving season park passes for themselves and three family members — a bonus worth around $300. Applebee’s offered an “Apps for Apps” deal in which applicants who were interviewed received a free appetizer voucher. Restaurants and gas stations across the country are offering signing bonuses.In contrast, the Mayorkas plan would extract foreign migrants from other countries and uses them to flood the labor market, depress salaries and spike real estate prices.Under Mayorkas’ plan, workers would compete for company jobs — flipping Biden’s plan to have companies compete for workers.Two reporters at theNew York Times— Michael ShearandZolan Kanno-Youngs — viewedthe worker-importation plan, which is likely written using poll-tested language:The blueprint, dated May 3 and titled “D.H.S. Plan to Restore Trust in Our Legal Immigration System,” lists scores of initiatives intended to reopen the country to more immigrants, making good on the president’s promise to ensure America embraces its “character as a nation of opportunity and of welcome.…Divided into seven sections, the document offers detailed policy proposals that would help more foreigners move to the United States, including high-skilled workers, trafficking victims, the families of Americans living abroad, American Indians born in Canada, refugees, asylum-seekers and farm workers. Immigrants who apply online could pay less in fees or even secure a waiver in an attempt to “reduce barriers” to immigration. And regulations would be overhauled to “encourage full participation by immigrants in our civic life.”TheNew York Timesdid not post a copy of the draft plan, and it also downplayed the wealth-shifting economic consequences of government-imposed labor inflation, saying:Most research has shown that legal immigration to the United States has benefits for the country’s economy, especially at a time when the country’s population growth is slowing. But Mr. [Ken] Cuccinelli and others who favor severe restrictions on immigration say it is obvious to them that letting foreigners compete for jobs — especially when the country is still recovering from an economic downturn like the one created by the pandemic — will hurt the prospects for American citizens.In reality, decades of experience show that labor inflation does both — it expands the economy and hurts working Americans.Legal immigration and illegal migration expand the economy by importing more consumers, renters, and workers, regardless of their health or skills. That inflow boosts Wall Street investors with extra revenues and profits.But migration simultaneouslycuts Americans’ wages, spikesreal estate costs,anddiverts much wealthfrom heartland states to the coasts, such asLos Angelesand New York.Migration also distorts national politics by shifting power to university-credentialled progressives and creating an alliance between the progressives and coastal investors, such as the investors in Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us group.The Zuckerberg investor grouphas close tiesto senior White House officials, including Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff. In April, the grouphelped reversea White House decision to stabilize the inflow of refugees in 2021. The group is now using its network of subsidized allies touse the reconciliation processto revive the stalled amnesty and cheap labor bills:NPRreported:[Ali Noorani of the National Immigration Forum] says Biden will soon have to demonstrate that he’s willing to put the same kind of political muscle behind getting something done on immigration.“After infrastructure gets off the table, we need to make sure that immigration is the next issue on the couch at the Oval Office,” he said. “And we’re not there yet.”Mayorkas repeatedly claims that the United States is a Nation of Immigrants — instead of a nation of Americans and their children — and has repeatedly sketched his plans to legally import more migrants.“We have a three-pronged approach,” Mayorkas told a Senatehearingon May 13. “Address the root causes [of migration], to build legal pathways [into the U.S.], and to advocate more with the hope that Congress will pass immigration reform,” said Mayorkas, who tweeted April 28 that “immigrant-owned businesses that are the backbone of our communities — and of our country.”“We’re increasing and improving legal migration,” Tyler Moran, a Mayorkas ally in the White House official,toldthe May 14Washington Post. “We have put in place a number of policies creating legal pathways to migrate and seek protection, and we see that as a metric of success,” she added.Mayorkas is already opening numerous side doors in the nation’s immigration law. Those side doors can legally admit an uncapped number ofasylum seekers,deportedparole recipients,teenage workers,refugees, andunreported illegal migrants.On May 25, the Associated Pressdescribedone of the lawfully deported migrants who Mayorkas invited to return using his legal authority to parole people into the United States:Keldy [Mabel Gonzales Brebe] counts her blessings to be together as a family, free from death threats in Honduras and the pain of separation.Yet now they face new difficulties. Keldy’s son, Mino, dropped out of school to help pay rent on the house that six of them share. Keldy sleeps on the living room sofa. She wants to get a job, but is caring for her 7-year-old autistic niece and an unsteady 75-year-old mother, along with cooking and cleaning for the family. She sees drug use on the streets of the Kensington section of Philadelphia where they live.“I hear gunshots sometimes. With my sister, when we run a quick errand, I look around to see whether someone was killed,” Keldy said. “La Ceiba, where I grew up, was like that.”Mayorkas has also demolished the Trump-era regulations that protect American graduates from the uncapped inflow ofcollege-trainedforeign workersfavored byU.S. Fortune 500 companies. The companies are pushing legislation that would allow companies to hire foreign workers with the promise of U. S. citizenship in exchange for10 yearsof low-wage, no-complaint work.GOP populists are spotlighting the wage-shifting impact of elite-backed labor migration.“One of the sad things about an immigration crisis like the one we now face is how badly hurt our own fellow citizens are, especially the most forgotten – our poor,” Ken Cuccinelli, a former top DHS official for President Donald Trump, told Breitbart News. He continued:Those of us on the right need to fight to protect America’s poor, including their wages and job opportunities, from being destroyed by a flood of illegal labor into the low end of the labor market. Too often, our poorest fellow citizens – who are disproportionally minorities, btw – are forgotten in the scramble of such a crisis.”If the government does not “artificially inflate the labor supply, then if you want that work done, you have to pay workers more to attract them to the work that you want done,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) pointed out during a March interview on Mobile, AL radio’s FM Talk 106.5. Brookscontinued:The employers will be put in a position where they either have to pay the wages that are necessary to attract the workforce they need that is necessary for their businesses to operate, or they go out of business. But that’s the way it is supposed to be in a free enterprise economy where the market forces allocate resources to what’s profitable and denies it to what is not profitable.“There is no job in America that Americans won’t do — there are jobs that Americans won’t do at the paltry wages that some employers want to pay,” said Brooks, who is running for U.S. Senate in Alabama.For many years, awidevarietyofpollstershaveshowndeepandbroadoppositiontolabor migrationand the inflow oftemporarycontract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.

The lease rate for its fleet of rigs remains solid for its assets deployed in the Gulf of Mexico, he said, and relatively stable crude oil prices are supporting the company’s bottom line.""While our third quarter results will likely be impacted by the current operational challenges, conditions are expected to improve toward year end,"" he said.Hercules in May secured a $420 million contract with the North Sea subsidiary of Maersk Oil to develop the region’s Culzean oil fieldLast year, the company spent more than $3 million in salvage costs on Rig 265, damaged in a natural gas explosion in the Gulf of Mexico."

7006357477,https://www.breitbart.com/news/must-try-harder-france-vows-to-end-school-neglect-of-arabic-2/,Must try harder: France vows to end school neglect of Arabic,"Paris (AFP) – In the ethnically mixed Paris suburb of Kremlin-Bicetre, a group of children sit quietly at their desks while outside their classmates frolic in the autumn sunshine.“Ayna yaskunu Adel? (where does Adel live)” teacher Hanan asks the children, pointing to a textbook drawing of a boy and girl in a village with a school and a mosque.Hands shoot up, and a little girl replies that he lives behind the “madrassa”, or school.Welcome to Lissane, one of a growing number of private language schools where the children and grandchildren of North African immigrants go to learn classical Arabic on Wednesday afternoons, when schools are closed, and on the weekend.While Hanan’s students, aged 7 to 10, study interrogative pronouns in one of seven classrooms housed in a former office building, a group of four-year-olds next door is singing a nursery rhyme about the parts of the body.So far, so normal, with the notable difference that female teachers wear the Muslim headscarf, a garment banned along with other religious symbols in state schools.But it is not so much the headscarves as the “Islamic sciences”, or religion lessons, conducted at Lissane and many other private Arabic language schools, that have drawn scrutiny in a country that has an uneasy relationship with its Muslim minority, the largest in Europe at an estimated five million.Lissane’s co-founder Abdelghani Sebata, a 37-year-old Algerian law graduate, says that the religious component of the course — which includes learning verses of the Koran — is “very light”.“We leave the religious side to the families,” he told AFP.But at the many mosques that also teach children to read and write the Arabic used in official communications, literature and media across the Arab world, as well as in the Koran, Islam is the main focus.– ‘Submission’ fears –A report on radicalisation last month by the Institut Montaigne, a respected liberal French think-tank, warned that Arabic classes had become “the best way for Islamists to attract young people into their mosques and (private) schools”.In response, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer — one of centrist President Emmanuel Macron’s most combative ministers — announced plans to take back control.Arguing that classical Arabic should be treated like all other “great languages” such as Russian and Chinese, he vowed to develop its teaching in state schools in order to combat “the drift towards self-ghettoisation” in private institutions.His proposal drew a furious reaction from rightwingers who view the use of Arabic by North African immigrants with hostility, seeing it as evidence of a failure to integrate.Luc Ferry, was was education minister under former centre-right president Jacques Chirac, questioned whether the government was bent on “fighting Islamism or bringing it into public education” — suggesting that by giving Arabic more prominence it was doing the latter.“We’re in a logic of submission,” fumed Louis Aliot, a lawmaker from the far-right National Rally (formerly National Front) party, echoing the title of a novel by controversial author Michel Houellebecq, “Submission”, which imagines a France ruled by Islamists.– Few options –Hakim El Karoui, author of the Institut Montaigne report which revived a long-running debate about France’s insistence that immigrants ditch their ethnic identities on arrival and embrace Frenchness, said he was “not at all” surprised by the reaction on the right.“Everything to do with Arabs drives them a bit mad,” El Karoui, a Tunisian-born geography scholar and former government advisor, told AFP.He points to the increasing scarcity of schools offering Arabic — France’s second-most spoken language, and one used by over 430 million people worldwide — as evidence of their reluctance to teach a subject associated with “problematic” immigrants.Only 567 primary schoolchildren studied Arabic last year, a third of the number who took Chinese as their mandatory second language. Most chose English.In secondary school, just 11,200 pupils studied Arabic, which is offered in a handful of schools in each city, mostly elite city-centre colleges.– ‘Singers, hip-hoppers, scientists’ –With demand far outstripping supply, parents have turned to mosques, religious associations and private schools like Lissane, which together attract some 80,000 students, according to a government estimate cited by the Institut Montaigne.Ines Kridaine, a 35-year-old Tunisian living in France for the past 13 years, enrolled her daughter Ikram in classes at Lissane at the age of four.Five years later Ikram can understand her Tunisian relatives, follow Arabic news channels and read the Koran. But Ines, who wears a headscarf and a loose abaya robe, still wishes Arabic was taught during class time.“It should be treated like any other language,” she said.Writing in Le Monde newspaper last month, the head of the prestigious Arab World Institute in Paris, former Socialist minister Jack Lang, defended Arabic as the language of “Arab Christians, Jews, Muslims and atheists, bloggers, social media, young people, writers, poets, artists, singers, hip-hoppers, scientists, researchers, journalists, companies and innovators”.It’s a view shared by Jerome Gercet, principal of an international secondary school in the southeastern city of Grenoble that has to turn away applicants for its Arabic section each year.After graduation, most of his students go on to study political science, medicine, business, engineering, arts or administration.That’s proof, he said, that Arabic is “a subject of excellence.”"

He is allegedly connected to a vast network of questionable charter schools operating across the United States.In 1999, Gülen fled his native Turkey after being accused of extremist Islamist activities. Today, he is considered a fierce opponent of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, although the two were considered allies until 2013. Then, as Turkish Prime Minister, Erdoğan accused Gülen of secretly backing a corruption investigation into the government, something Erdoğan called retaliation after he shut down some of Gülen’s schools in Turkey.Gülen is said to head a powerful movement called “Hizmet,” a form of Islam that emphasizes service and education. Reportedly, his supportersstartedmore than 1,000 schools and universities in over 100 countries, including approximately 150 U.S. taxpayer-funded charter schools. They operate in as many as 26 states and go by a variety of franchise names. They claim to specialize in math and science. Many are mired in controversy, coming under investigation for misuse of public funds, abuse of the H-1B visa program, kickback schemes and more.Breitbart Newsreportedthese charter schools may soon open on U.S. military bases, according to accusations made Robert Amsterdam — the attorney for the Turkish government. His firm, Amsterdam & Partners LLP, was hired in 2015  to conduct a comprehensive international investigation into Gülen’s alleged illegal activities through the reputed Gülen Organization.The largest number of these reportedly Gülen-affiliated schools are in Texas where nearly 31,000 students are served by 46 schools under charter operator The Cosmos Foundation, d.b.a. “Harmony Public Schools”. The chain plans to open 10 more schools over the next two years, adding approximately 10,000 students. In Texas, these open enrollment public charter schools are funded by more than $250 million state and federal taxpayer dollars annually.This year, the Republic of Turkey called for a full scale investigation into the charter’s practices in Texas. Amsterdam filed a formal complaint with the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The documentallegedmisuse of H-1B visas; preferential hiring and employment practices towards Turkish nationals and males; discriminatory vendor bidding practices; and misappropriation of taxpayer dollars, including funneling monies to the Gülen Organization, among other charges. Amsterdamaccusedthe schools of more than $18 million worth of taxpayer fraud in a second complaint.Even before the coup attempt, Amsterdam called for President Obama to extradite Gülen back to Ankara based on his purported criminal conduct through the Gülen Organization.According toUSA Today, Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday Turkey’s government first has to prove Gülen’s role in the failed military coup to be able to consider extradition.Last year, Breitbart NewsreportedFBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds believed Gülen to be a threat to U.S. interests. Leaked information revealed the U.S. government’s concern that these schools were being used to indoctrinate students and use taxpayer dollars to fund the Gülen movement in Turkey. Harmony officials continue to dispute these allegations and deny any connections to Gülen.In 2014, the FBIraided19 schools in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. According to theCenter for Security Policy, a Washington D.C.-based national security think tank, nine schools have been closed or removed from Gülenist control in California (3), Florida (1), Georgia (1), Louisiana (1), Maryland (1), Minnesota (1), and Wisconsin (1).In 2015, the Center for Security Policyaccountedfor Gulen-affiliate charters in Arizona (7), Arkansas (2), California (11), Colorado (1), District of Columbia (1), Florida (10), Georgia (2), Illinois (4), Indiana (3), Louisiana (1), Maryland (4), Massachusetts (3), Michigan (1), Minnesota (1), Missouri (5), Nevada (2), New Jersey (6), New Mexico (1), New York (4), North Carolina (2), Ohio (19), Oklahoma (4), Pennsylvania (3), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (1), Utah (1), Wisconsin (1), and Texas which, at the time, had 45 of these charters.In 2011,The New York Timesexposedcorruption of taxpayer money associated with the Cosmos Foundation, the charter school operator founded 10 years earlier by a group of professors and businessmen from Turkey and operating in the U.S. under the name Harmony Schools. Many were dubbed Gülen followers.A new documentary,Killing Ed: Charter Schools, Corruption, and the Gülen Movement in America,takes an in-depth look at the chain’s operations in the Lone Star State, supporting widespread claims made about the Gülen movement.Follow Merrill Hope,a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter@OutOfTheBoxMom."

He is no longer with theDallas Morning News.On ESPN’sAround the Horn, frequent guest Kevin Blackistone saidthat football games should not include the singing of the national anthem beforehand, as that added to the “military symbolism.” He actually called the Star-Spangled Banner a “war anthem.”Blackistone was addressing controversy over Northwestern University’s American flag-themed football uniforms, designed to raise money for the Wounded Warriors Project. In a show segment titled “Buy or Sell,” Blackistone said that he would “sell” the uniforms:I’m going to sell it for the same reasons. If you sell this along with me, you should also be selling the rest of the military symbolism embrace of sports. Whether it’s the singing of a war anthem to open every game. Whether it’s going to get a hotdog and being able to sign up for the Army at the same time. Whether it’s the NFL’s embrace of the mythology of thePat Tillmanstory. It has been going on in sports since the first national anthem was played in the World Series back in 1917. And it’s time for people to back away.When prompted by host Tony Reali about the difference between “calling a football game a ‘battle,’ right, and singing the national anthem before a game,” Blackistone shot back, “You are conflating a war anthem with a simple game.

It ordered a retrial, though no date has been set.In Egypt and other Muslim-majority countries, the Muslim Brotherhood has been designated aterrorist group.Last year, Egypt’s Court of Cassation alsorescinded Morsi’s death sentenceand ordered a retrial in the case involving accusations of espionage on behalf of the Palestinian group Hamas, which the United States and other nations have deemed aterrorist organization.As military chief, current Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the public movement to overthrow Morsi in July 2013. The Egyptian government has since declared MB a terrorist group.Drawing criticism from some human rights group, such asAmnesty International, the Sisi government has targeted members of the movement and other Islamist groups, resulting in tens of thousands of arrests and mass trials.“Hundreds of sympathizers of the [MB] party, which is blacklisted in Egypt, have been killed by security forces,” addsWSJ.Morsi has been tried on various charges, including escaping prison during the 2011 protests against then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.“He was also accused of sharing state secrets with foreign powers, including Qatar,” reportsAl Jazeera. “His defense argued that he was merely engaging all foreign entities within the limits that any head of state would.”“Morsi was given several sentences, including life, a 20-year prison term and the death penalty,” it adds. “He appealed against those sentences, but has already had the20-year term confirmedby an Appellate Court.”Abdel Moneim Abdel Maqsoud, Morsi’s lawyer, toldAgence France-Presse (AFP)that the sentences imposed against several Muslim Brotherhood officials linked to the former president on charges of spying on behalf of Iran and Hamas have also been overturned."

Heinicke also showed great speed and pocket awareness when he tucked the ball and ran 11 yards on a third-and-9 play.It was the first career TD pass for Heinicke and Thomas’ first career TD catch, meaning the youngsters will have to fight over who keeps the ball.Running back Christian McCaffrey also became the first Carolina running back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season since DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart both accomplished the feat in 2009.—Steve Reed reporting from Charlotte, North Carolina.___1:20 p.m.Dallas defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford was taken off the field on a cart after getting injured on the second play of the game against Tampa Bay.Crawford’s neck was stabilized on a stretcher with his facemask removed, and several teammates looked distraught as he was treated on the field.The seventh-year player was moving his arms while on the stretcher, and he moved his legs while being treated before going on the stretcher.There was no immediate word on the nature of the injury.Crawford started every game so far this season and was second on the team with 5 1/2 sacks.

Specifically the group complained to Google about porn on Google Play, porn on Google-owned YouTube, and also porn on Google ads.In addition, early last month Google announced itremovedall pornographic apps and most sexual apps from Google Play. According to Dawn Hawkins of Porn Harms, Google has improved its “safe search” and “safety mode” and has created a tool for parents in Google’s safety center.Porn Harms says it found out about this change via the porn industry news sites that have been complaining about the change.Activists are still asking for Google to block porn on YouTube and to increase the protection for children in the Google search engine. Bing, for instance, uses “a moderately filtered” default search, while Google’s is wide open. Google could allow its users to opt into a wide-open search; as it is now, however, this is the default."

Holcomb vetos bill to ban transgender student athletes from girls’ sports,"March 22 (UPI) — Indiana’s Republican governor, Eric Holcomb, has vetoed a bill that would have banned transgender athletes from competing in girls’ sports.Holcomb vetoed House Enrolled Act No. 1041 on Monday, stating in a letter to lawmakers that he did so because it presumes “there is an existing problem in K-12 sports in Indiana that requires further state government intervention.”“It implies that the goals of consistency and fairness in competitive female sports are not currently being met,” he wrote. “After thorough review, I find no evidence to support either claim even if I support the overall goal.”He also rejected the bill on the grounds that it is unclear about how it will be applied statewide to ensure all student athletes are treated the same and that two similar laws passed by other states have either been enjoined or prohibited by the court.The Republican-led law, which was passed by both chambers of the state’s legislature, prohibits biologically male-born students from participating on an athletic team designated for girls, though it makes no such restriction for student athletes born as biological girls from competing in boy-designated competitions.Several Republican-controlled states have sought to pass similar laws, arguing that having transgender athletes compete in girl-designated sports affords them an unfair advantage, which could impact athletic scholarships. Opponents of such legislation dispute this claim and say bills such as the one in Indiana are not only discriminatory but harm marginalized youth by denying them the opportunity to play with their peers.“Gov. Holcomb did the right thing tonight in vetoing a bill that would only cause problems, not solve them, by targeting Indiana’s transgender children and making them the targets of exclusion and discrimination in their own schools,” Cathryn Oakley, the state legislative director and senior counsel for Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement.Holcomb’s veto, however, could be overruled by a simply majority vote in both chambers."
7052840913,https://www.breitbart.com/blog/2014/10/31/catcalling-and-the-fine-art-of-manufactured-crisis/,Catcalling and the fine art of manufactured crisis,"In response toIn Defense of Catcalls:Catcalling, of course, an entirely manufactured “crisis,” done clumsily enough to where you can still see the “insert tab A into slot B” stickers on the parts.  Judging by Allahpundits lively “Quote of the Day” roundup atHot Air, it worked beautifully, creating a 24-hour social-issue flash-in-the-pan thateveryonefelt obliged to weigh in on.  That most definitely includes skeptics who realize the importance of getting into these discussions early.  The memory of how a Democrat campaign operative posing as a “debate moderator,” George Stephanopolous, kicked off the “War on Women” by blindsiding the 2012 GOP candidates with a planted question will linger long in our minds.  We’ve learned that we can’t let the Left have a field day with social issues for months, until we end up responding with a snort of disbelief that anyone is taking their latest goofball crusade seriously.From a technical standpoint, the “catcall” video is an interesting example of how editing can be used to generate any impression a media supplier wishes to create.  The young woman in this video evidently spent her 10 hours in New York City stomping straight ahead with a faintly annoyed expression on her face, completely ignoring everything from polite greetings to boorish behavior.  If we dug through those ten hours of video, I suspect we would find more than two minutes’ worth of footage of people being exceptionally nice to her, which we could edit into a video showing that New Yorkers are less rude than their stereotype holds… but of course, that isn’t the video these activists wanted to make.  There’s also the highly suspicious matter of their claims that they couldn’t find any “usable” footage of white guys being ultra-rude to the actress, while assuring us such encounters took place, to fend off criticism that their end product was racially biased.  Give me ten hours of footage from just about anywhere, and I suspect I could edit it into anything from a heartwarming slice-of-life story to a horror movie.  This whole genre of secretly filming a large number of people and editing it down to a reel that supposedly “proves” some group is horrible is inherently disingenuous.But on the social-issues front, there’s the question of exactly what this “movement” against “street harassment” (so described by its aspiring activists) plans todoabout the “crisis.”  If they’re raising money to cut PSAs and publish brochures emphasizing the importance of good manners, that’s great – more power to ’em.  But they seem determined to go further than that, at which point one has to wonder how you canforcemen to stop addressing women unless expressly granted permission to do so, without running afoul of the First Amendment, to say nothing of how such laws would be enforced.  (A vast crew of Polite Police swarming through the streets of every major city, ready to write a citation against every man who uses the term “baby” to address a female over three years of age?  GoPro video cameras affixed to the breast of every woman, capturing evidence to be used in the trial of every man who looks in the vicinity of the camera too intently)This is one of those “consciousness-raising” things: a “crisis” that can never actually be solved, a facet of society that existed for long before any modern-era “movement” coalesced around it.  No surprise that liberals gloomy over a bad election would leap at the chance to spend a day or two talking obsessively about something that can be plugged into the fading “War on Women” campaign.  It’s also one of those things you’re not supposed to be able to challenge,at all,without indicting yourself as insufficiently understanding.  To ask tough questions of the Catcall Movement is to charge yourself as a boor, an apologist for boors, or a doormat woman brainwashed by the patriarchy, and thus useless to your feminist social-justice warrior sisters.  Stage One of getting a manufactured social-issue crisis off the ground is establishing that all questions about the legitimacy of the crisis only prove its urgency.  Even a moment’s hesitation to get on board means you’re part of the “problem.”Hence the paragraph from Slate captured in one of Allahpundit’s Quotes of the Day: “Some men, though, still aren’t seeing it. On Twitter, some are pushing back against the video, claiming that it’s not harassment, it’s just annoying, and that refusing to reply is, frankly, impolite.  Of course, it’s largely women who are singled out for constant annoyance just for stepping outside, and are dismissed as rude for not accepting it graciously.  If you don’t get it after watching this video, the problem isn’t just the guys caught yelling at Roberts.  The problem is you.”See how that works?  The “street harassment” video isn’t just an indictment of the men captured in that minute-and-a-half of footage, culled from ten hours of tape.  It’s an indictment of theviewer.If your response is, “I’m not sure if this is as bad as the filmmakers think,” or “some of the guys in this video aren’t being all that rude, really,” or “sheesh, guys have been shouting out to women since before my great-grandpa was in diapers,”the problem is you.In the spirit of Halloween, we might compare it to the cursed videotape from “The Ring.”"

There is one that seems to have been circulated to all the usual suspects amongst the liberal illuminati and they are repeating it over and over ad nauseum. The talking point in question? The Tea Party is a bunch of terrorists. Last week, Thomas Friedman compared them to Hezbollah. Joe Biden piled on as well, saying that they “acted like terrorists.” The Grey Lady’sJoe Noceracarries on the meme as well, while kicking it up a notch. Not only are they terrorists, but they’ve been waging a jihad on the American people.It really isn’t the point of this article to mention the fact that theNew York Timesrefuses to call, you know, actual terrorists “terrorists.” They’re just militants. Even the term Jihad, according to unindicted co-conspirators CAIR, “includes struggle against evil inclinations within oneself, struggle to improve the quality of life in society, etc. etc.” It’s clear that this definition only holds true when discussing misunderstood Muslims who really only want to be loved and hugged, especially when they’re flying jet liners into buildings and blowing up subways.Nocera rails against the terror tactics of the Tea party that have kept the American people dumbstruck with horror. They scorned compromise, unlike the President and Senate Majority leader who, at every opportunity, said that any bill that included cuts would be Dead on Arrival. The fact that the Tea Party was unwilling to budge on what President Obama recently referred to as “Job Killing Tax Increases” is irrefutable proof that they hate Americans and worked with “gleeful willingness” to destroy American faith and credit.Of course, we know that this interpretation of the Tea Party stance is either total mind numbing ignorance or a malicious distortion of the facts. Nocera is obviously basing his stance on the idea that it is default that will cause damage to the money market’s faith in America. This canard is one made of whole cloth by the Obama administration. It has been shown over and over again that America is in no danger of immediate default. The market, on the other hand, is quite worried about the future. A future of ballooning debt is what keeps them awake at night. At some point, the cost of servicing that debt will overtake the government’s income. It was the ratings agencies that threatened to drop America’s bonds from AAA to AA if there weren’t $4 Trillion in budget cuts. The Tea Party understands this, even if the Washington elites either don’t care or can’t quite fathom the economics involved.While the above is, at best, silly and, at worst, malicious, it isn’t stupid. That’s what comes next in Nocera’s screed.“America’s real crisis is not a debt crisis. It’s an unemployment crisis.”Well, yes, America has an unemployment crisis. That is mostly because of the Obama administration’s job killing policies. The Health Control bill, Dodd-Frank, the endless regulations pumped out by the EPA, the ongoing demonization of business, the kowtowing to every whim of the unions and the uncertainty about whether or not new onerous taxes will be imposed all work together to prevent anyone from hiring.The double speak then deployed is mind numbing. As he discusses the need to foster job creation he drops in this line:“Incredibly, the Democrats even abandoned their demand for extended unemployment benefits as part of the deal.”I’m not sure where this particular bit of paralogia comes from, but it has appeared before in liberal talking points. Paying people for being unemployed reduces unemployment. Why would people go back to work if they’re getting paid not to work? Do people have to turn in their common sense when they start writing for theNew York Times?It is true that economic growth could go a long way to work on reducing the debt. There is only one tried and true way of growing the economy and that is reducing government’s involvements in the markets. That means fewer regulations, fewer subsidies, lower taxes.We can look around the world and find nowhere that Keynesian economics have been an overwhelming success. Even Germany, the poster child for the socialist democracies of Europe, realized years ago that the best way to improve the economy is by cutting taxes. In 2004, Germany had one of the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world at over 40%. A year later, seeing that their economy was stagnating, they cut that rate by almost 14%. This has jump-started their economy to the point that they are able to bail out every failing state in the European Union.Joe Nocera is, in the end, a small, malicious, lying hack. He clearly does not care about the truth. He does not care about Middle America. He does care about the less fortunate. He cares about the progressive agenda, and he knows the only way to move the progressive agenda forward is to bribe people to vote for Democrats. He only cares about getting more people beholden to the bloated government so they’ll keep putting their patrons back in power.We do not wear suicide vests. We do not wish harm to the country. We are not terrorists. We are not extremists. We are the majority. We are the people."

The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency said the country’s key economic and financial indicators are stable.For fiscal year 2015, the country reported total revenue for fiscal year 2015 at $162 billion, an estimated 15 percent decline from budgeted revenues. Oil revenues are expected to reach $118 billion, a decline of 23 percent from the previous year.The government in December said it was setting up a $48.7 billion stimulus package to support projects designated as national priorities because of “excess” volatility in crude oil prices. Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, announced plans to list its shares on the public market for the first time ever as part of a government reform agenda that includes privatization of some economic sectors,S&P said the government revenue for the oil-rich kingdom will fall by about 16 percent. From the perspective of the ratings agency, Riyadh is pegging its budget to oil priced at around $45 per barrel.Last month, S&P lowered its price assumption by about $20 per barrel through 2019 for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark price.“We now assume $40 per barrel in 2016,” the ratings agency said."

But the chancellor’s letter confirms that this is not the case.”Two days ago, a Tory think tank claiming the support of 120 Brexit-supporting MPs said they couldblocka final divorce deal unless the Prime Minister promised to leave the Customs Union and Single Market."

The timber industry accounts for 17,000 jobs and 60 percent of non-oil related GDP.But at the port of Owendo on the Libreville peninsula, exports have stagnated for months and warehouses are overflowing.The trouble began in late February, when customs officials discovered huge quantities of kevazingo, a precious and banned hardwood, in two Chinese-owned depots at Owendo.Nearly 5,000 cubic metres (176,000 cubic feet) were seized, worth around $8 million, some of it disguised in containers bearing the stamp of the forestry ministry.Several suspects were arrested, but the plot thickened in April, when 353 of the confiscated containers mysteriously disappeared from the port.The ensuing scandal, dubbed kevazingogate, led to the government sacking the vice president, the forestry minister and several senior civil servants.The minister was replaced last month by British-born Lee White — an environmental campaigner who has lived for years in Gabon, battling to conserve its forests and wildlife.– Scandal hits exports –The scandal has “heavily affected people working in Gabon’s timber industry, without differentiating between those who cheat and those who play by the rules,” said Philippe Fievez, head of French timber company Rougier in Gabon, which has been present in the country since colonial times.He said the company had been able to export wood for just three of the first six months of the year and at the height of the crisis had had to temporarily lay off 400 of its 1,400 employees.“It’s going to take us between six and nine months to return to normal.”After the stash of kevazingo, also called bubinga, was found in late February, the team responsible for checking cargo loaded onto ships at ports was suspended, accused of complicity in a smuggling plot.The following month, timber exports ground to a halt.“A month later, the team was replaced, allowing exports to resume,” said Fievez.But then the containers vanished in April, and several top executives were suspended and the fallout reached the highest reaches of power.Francoise Van de Ven, secretary-general of the forestry industry association UFIGA, said, “our companies have been unable to export since early May — we are talking about a considerable loss of profits”.White, the new forestry minister, “immediately took on the case” after his appointment in mid-June and exports “have just resumed,” she said.But the scandal has inflicted “significant” reputational damage, she admitted.– ‘Tarnished image’ –Exports were also hit by a damning report issued by British NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) in March that pointed the finger at a Chinese group, Dejia, which has widespread logging interests in the Congo Basin.The report laid out the apparent ease with which officials took bribes to cover up the fraudulent activities of some loggers, and within weeks of its release the government suspended Dejia’s licence at two logging sites.Benjamin Feng of the Chinese company KHLL Forestry said that now “buyers have the impression there is a risk of purchasing illegal timber when buying wood from Gabon”.“We have about 1,500 cubic metres (53,000 cu. feet) of azobe wood ready to go to Europe, but my Dutch buyer is hesitating, asking me: ‘What proves that your wood is legal?’.”“I can prove it, I have all the papers, but the image has been tarnished,” he said.Rougier’s Fievez tried to look on the bright side.“At least the scandal had the merit of pointing out the bad practices of some loggers — now everyone plays by the same rules.”"
7058844317,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2015/04/27/gutcheck-danas-smash-hit-the-gutfeld-interview/,GUTCHECK: Dana’s Smash Hit. The Gutfeld Interview,"Greg Gutfeld sits downs with his Co-Host on The Five, Dana Perino, to discuss her new bookAnd the Good News Is…: Lessons and Advice from the Bright Side.GREG GUTFELD:Since this is your first book, how terrified were you of failing miserably (I have read the book already, and know that it’s really great, and will sell tons). How did you plan it out? Was it hard to get started?DANA PERINO:Enough that I got cold feet and didn’t send it to a friend who warned me that he was a tough critic. I also hesitated to send it to you. I held my breath for hours after I emailed you and nearly fainted with relief when I got your feedback when you landed in California.Years ago I was approached about writing a book and the concept forAnd the Good News Is…was rejected by one publisher as too soft. They wanted a fire-breathing political book from me (they didn’t think a book like the one I just wrote would sell. It appears they were wrong). They kept trying to put words in my mouth, and I said that that’s not the kind of book that I’d ever write. So I abandoned the idea. But then Sean Desmond called from Twelve and he took my crude, handwritten outline and turned it into a proposal that his publisher liked. Fifteen months later, here we are, selling a book.My outline included subheads like “swallow your sarcasm, be the most prepared, disagree without being a jerk” and a list of stories from my White House days that I wanted to write, so all of that was pretty much mapped out but not organized. Then my editor explained that you couldn’t write a book that was part memoir/part advice and just show up at age 35 as the White House press secretary. He wanted to know how I got to that position, what was my childhood like, how did I become who I am today. And the more I thought about it, I realized that my upbringing and my meeting my husband on an airplane were essential to explaining how a person like me – who grew up in a rural environment with no political connections–ended up working for the President of the United States. And so I had to do some research to make sure I had the family history in Wyoming right, and I even employed my husband to write his version of the story of how we met. I also had guidance from a mutual friend who told me I should write about why I’m a conservative. He was right–the ending of the book wraps it up well.GREG GUTFELD:Where did you write most of it? I wrote in bars. How about you—in dog parks, nestled in the hollow of a tree?DANA PERINO:Well, it is hard to balance my laptop on one knee, but I ended up having to do that because I wrote in my rocking chair in my bedroom and Jasper insisted on sitting next to me. I also wrote sitting on my porch swing bed in South Carolina, again with Jasper up against me. I wrote in the mornings and on weekends and holidays. I got distracted a lot by emails and by tweeting pictures of my dog, and I didn’t take any time off of The Five to write.You have a stronger stomach than mine–I could never write in a bar. I demand silence!GREG GUTFELD:What’s the best advice you have for writing a book. (Mine is always have a notebook around, and drink red wine while you write. Once you get drunk, you can stop writing). What worked for you?DANA PERINO:I needed time alone. I didn’t like to be with other people while I was writing (except that I could write a lot on airplanes, surrounded by people. That’s weird). When I turned in the first draft, the editor wanted a lot more detail. And since I’m a good student, I provided him with A LOT MORE DETAIL. So much detail that then the book was way too long and had to be cut back by tens of thousands of words. I realize now something that you told me–that I don’t even miss the material that was cut. So I think I had to over-write in order to get to a better product. Just like gardening!I’d also try to write just as I’d tell a story. I used parentheses to make a side comment and section breaks to try to let a moment sink in for a bit. Sometimes I’d read a paragraph out loud and realize it didn’t sound good. Often I’d go back to read a previous section that I’d been pleased with and realize it was total crap and delete all of it.Writing the book was a good experience. It almost felt industrious, which is strange to say since I really sat for many hours and wrote with a hot laptop burning my thighs and not burning any calories. But I really feel like the book is one of my greatest accomplishments. I know a lot of people helped make this book happen, but I actually wrote and wrestled with it on my own, so I’m proud of it.GREG GUTFELD:When I read the book, I was fascinated by your upbringing—I didn’t expect to find that, and assumed it would be mostly political. But it was my favorite part—the life and times of a farm girl. Was that hard to write, stuff about growing up? How did that inform your life?DANA PERINO:It was a joy to write down my family history, and I’m so glad that now we all have it (even if it is just my version of it). Around the time I started writing, I got a binder in the mail from a fan of The Five. It was filled with detailedAncestry.comwork about the Perino family. The woman that sent it to me was a seventh cousin, and she’d picked up on my comments on the show about Wyoming. She took a chance that we were related, and her information was helpful.I also called my mom, dad, aunts, and uncles and texted with my cousin to make sure I had details right, such as the name of my Grandpa’s horse, the original homestead establishment, my grandfathers’ military service, and more. I realized that I had a unique American upbringing, and one thing I wanted to do with the book was make sure that people growing up in flyover country know that they don’t have to go to an Ivy League school or live in a big city to end up advising the President of the United States in the Oval Office.The more I wrote about my childhood the more I realized I missed it. The early years on the ranch shaped who I am today, and they continue to inform my thinking and commentary on Fox News. I love the line that my great-grandparents walked into one side of the American dream, grew a ranch from the original homestead to over 50,000 acres in the Black Hills, and 100 years later I walk out the other side as the press secretary of the United States. They never would have imagined that would happen, but isn’t that the reason that people seek to come to America? They don’t know what their heirs will do, but they give them the best possible chance by being a part of the most amazing country in the history of the world. “God bless America, indeed” is how I close chapter 1.GREG GUTFELD:Tell me about the cover. What are you so happy about? I’ve never seen someone so happy to be on a cover.DANA PERINO:I have a lot to be happy about, for one. And I wanted a book that people would want to pick up, that they’d be drawn to. I wanted to have a different look and feel, so that when people saw my book they’d think, “Oh, I kind of like her…even if she is a Republican.”However, it isn’t a political book, or just a book with some advice–it’s a story with some politics, advice, and romance all mixed together. I knew I’d be looking at that book for the rest of my life, so I wanted the photograph to capture me at my happiest. Melanie Dunea was the photographer. She’s photographed a lot of cookbooks and country music stars, so I said “sign her up!” She and I knew exactly what we were looking for, and I’m really pleased with it.GREG GUTFELD:This book is essentially an advice book that reads like a real book. Which is a rarity. Most advice books don’t tell stories, and the advice is trite and worn out. But your memoir functions as entertainment and service—did you intend that?DANA PERINO:Since I left the White House, I’ve been invited to give a lot of speeches (so for anyone bummed that Hillary Clinton is off the speaking circuit, call me) and I found that no matter how many times I tried to write a new speech with fresh material and statistics and political analysis, the only thing that really moved an audience was my story telling about what it was like to work in the White House.I have self-deprecating stories about humility, such as when I got hit in the eye socket by the steel arm of the boom mic in Iraq when the shoes were thrown at the President and I finished the last six weeks of the Bush administration with a black eye (I know, I know). I witnessed moments of presidential strength when he stuck up for America when no cameras were rolling, and how he cupped a wounded Marine’s face in his hands, tears running down his face onto the wounded, as he told the military aide to present him with the Purple Heart.I got to laugh with the President on Marine One, to conspire with him to stick up for a female reporter who was big footed by a guy who had been on the job for about 10 minutes, and to give him frank assessments such as when the McCain-Palin campaign intended to insult him by making it impossible for him to travel in time for the GOP convention in 2008. President Bush was more than my boss–he became a friend, a second father, and a lifetime confidant. The best way for me to explain that to people, to give them advice on how to conduct themselves graciously and honorably, is to tell them stories that illustrate my points.I break down the advice sections into things that people can do immediately at the office, throughout their careers, and for their lives. My best advice is that “Choosing to be loved is not a career limiting decision,” and I explain how I could have talked myself out of quitting my great Capitol Hill job and moving to England to be with a man 18 years older than me that had been married twice before and had children who weren’t that much younger than me. But I was given advice not to walk away from a chance to be loved, and that was the best advice I ever received. Because of Peter, I’ve been able to take more risks with confidence that I would be ok if it didn’t work out.And one of the best stories in the book is how I got caught in between the director of communications and the President over an interview, and President Bush basically told me I wasn’t needed in the Oval Office at that time. I tiptoed out of the Oval and when I got to the desk I called Peter, totally mortified, and told him what happened. He immediately knew how to make me feel better. He said, “Just think — for the rest of your life you can say, ‘I’ve been kicked out of better places than this,’ and just like that, I was restored.GREG GUTFELD:Did anyone give you sound or helpful advice about how to boost your writing skills (this is where you can mention me).DANA PERINO:Oh, like someone named Reg Rutfeld? Yes, he was quite helpful. Before I wrote this book, I had never written anything longer than a speech. Short press statements are my specialty. I had worked on a lot of other books–providing initial ideas, editorial direction, publicity suggestions, but I have never been an author. What I appreciated so much about your advice and support is that you knew that I was a reader and that I love books, and so when I started the process you treated me like an author from the beginning, not as just another press secretary writing a book.Early drafts showed my timidity, and you suggested I punch up the language, that I use one word or phrase to start a paragraph, so that it popped. I tried that a couple of times and it worked. And after I got used to that, I realized that my writing started to sound more conversational, and one of the best compliments I’ve received is that my book sounds like I’m talking to them, that I’m telling the reader the story directly. I didn’t know that was the goal of writing a book, but it turned out that way and I thank you for your help.Now do you feel sorry for being so mean to me all the time?GREG GUTFELD:I commend you on the fine balancing act you attained with Jasper. You had enough of him in there to please dog fans, but not a whole lot to make people like me throw up. Was that also intentional?DANA PERINO:Not at first. In fact, when the second pass edits came back and the book was way too long, there was much gnashing of teeth, but I sacrificed the entire chapter I’d written about dogs. But I saved the material to use at a later date. That book will probably outsell any of the books we’ll ever write combined.One thing I cut but that I’ll share here is that you were one of the first people I told that my elderly dog Henry had died. We had been emailing about something else and it caught you by surprise. And you were kind to me that day. That one day. I’ll never forget it!GREG GUTFELD:As you know I hate positive things, abhor optimists. Yet I get along with you. What is your philosophy?DANA PERINO:I mean, come on–who couldn’t get along with America’s sweetheart?GREG GUTFELD:I deem you a positive pessimist—in that you don’t expect things to go as ideally planned, but you’re happily prepared to meet such challenges. Is that a fair assessment?DANA PERINO:OK, I’ve never heard that phrase before. And I think you’re right. That’s what I am. I am a positive pessimist. I think I need to sit down. No, seriously, that’s true. In the chapter where I explain why I’m a conservative I explain it is because I look to facts, logic, and science to inform my thinking, and then I figure out what I can do from there to deal with the situation. You’re right, I’m not all sunshine and light, but I look for the positive. It’s like the Serenity Prayer says (bear with me)–it helps me sort out what I can change, what I can’t change, and how to tell the difference. I think you’re onto something, Greg. You could start a new movement (except you’re a Pessimist Pessimist). You certainly could shorten that to “pest,” however.GREG GUTFELD:Who is your favorite person onThe Five?DANA PERINO:Allison DeBois, the stage manager. She always laughs at my jokes. She sees where I’m headed before anyone else (sort of how I start laughing before you finish a joke…I get you)."

She told MSNBC that the supporters there were “defiant and dismissed” the Democrats’ articles of impeachment and vowed to come out in support of Trump more forcefully in 2020:She said in part:So perhaps unsurprising after all these months of being at rallies and talking to the president’s fiercest supporters who maintain that the president did nothing wrong, we caught up with them right after that press conference you referenced earlier and talked to them about their feelings of these two articles of impeachment. Folks basically were defiant and dismissed them, which is something we’ve heard time and time again.Trump supporters are confident, Alba found, that the Democrats’ partisan impeachment effort will backfire and “harden his support heading into 2020.”“But the overarching theme has to do with exactly the reason we’re here today in Hershey, and that is because of the president’s reelection campaign,” she said.“These supporters actually believe that the impeachment headlines from today will only harden his support heading into 2020,” she said.“They’ve been digging at this even before he was elected so I think they’re just grabbing for straws that aren’t there,” one supporter said. Another woman added:You can see how upset I am. I’m telling you right now there are people out here that are so enraged. We are so fed up, and so of course we’re going to be stronger even coming back to vote for President Trump again.Supporters began lining up for the rally as early as 4:00 a.m., Alba added.The promise of Trump supporters in Pennsylvania is significant, as it remains one of the key states that contributed to Hillary Clinton’s upset loss in 2016, which had notvotedred in a general election since 1988. TrumpedgedClinton out by less than a single percentage point – 48.2 percent to 47.5 percent.A recent Firehouse/Optimus December Battleground State Poll,takenDecember 3-5, 2019, among 598 Pennsylvania voters, showed Trump leading every major Democrat in the current Democrat field – Joe Biden (D), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), and Michael Bloomberg (D) – in Pennsylvania. The margin of error is +/- 4.3 percent:Trump’s rally in Hershey is scheduled to kick off at 7:00 p.m ET."

There was major confusion as it appeared as if VAR had ruled out the effort, but it was allowed to stand.“We made it difficult for ourselves,” said Alli. “We controlled the game and bossed possession. It was my first start and great to be back in the team but overall a disappointing result.“We know we have a world-class team so it’s about showing what we can do when things don’t go our way. It’s important we turn it around. We know how good we are, we just have to start showing it on the pitch.”Leicester held a minute’s silence before kick-off to remember their late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who was killed in a helicopter crash at the stadium last October.Chris Wood put Burnley in front but Leicester’s in-form forward Jamie Vardy headed an equaliser just before half-time and Tielemans completed the turnaround with just over 15 minutes to go.“We didn’t play as well as we can and we couldn’t get into our rhythm as much as we would have liked,” said Leicester defender Jonny Evans.“But luckily Youri (Tielemans) got us our goal.”– Leicester go second –Ahead of City’s match at Crystal Palace later on Saturday, Leicester were second in the table, seven points behind leaders Liverpool, while Chelsea, also on 17 points, were third.Matt Targett scored a goal deep into injury time as Aston Villa came back from 1-0 down to beat 10-man Brighton 2-1.Southampton took the lead against Wolves at Molineux, courtesy of a Danny Ings goal but were pegged back by a Raul Jimenez penalty while Bournemouth drew 0-0 at home to Norwich.In the early kick-off on Saturday, Everton climbed out of the relegation zone with a well-deserved 2-0 victory against West Ham that eased the pressure on Marco Silva.A first-half goal from Brazil forward Bernard and a late second from substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson gave Everton the three points in a match in which they had 19 shots.“It was a fantastic performance,” Sigurdsson told BT Sport. “We had a lot of chances, especially in the second half. You never know when it’s 1-0 — you always want to get more.“They are dangerous going forward and their goalkeeper made some spectacular saves. I was pleased to come on and give us a bit of comfort. There was a real purpose to our game today.”Manchester City head to Crystal Palace in the late match on Saturday.Pep Guardiola left Sergio Aguero and Riyad Mahrez out of his starting line-up but there was a place on the bench for defender John Stones after an injury lay-off.Liverpool travel to Old Trafford on Sunday, chasing a record-equalling 18th consecutive Premier League win while Manchester United are just one point above the relegation zone.Arsenal face Sheffield United on Monday."
7069007389,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2009/12/31/burts-eye-view-new-years-resolutions/,Burt's Eye View: New Year's Resolutions,"This is the time of year when most people are busy resolving to do better in the future. Some people vow to go on diets or exercise more, some promise to give up smoking or booze. But, year in and year out, I vow to cut liberals more slack and give them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, just as with other people’s good intentions, my own rarely last until nightfall. The difference is that the reason mine die on the vine, as it were, has nothing to do with my own lack of character, but everything to do with the failings of liberals.For one thing, liberals are hypocritical. They have agendas when they’d be better off having principles. They praise whistle-blowers and investigative reporters, but only when Republicans, conservatives and/or the U.S. military suffer the consequences. So it was that they lionized Daniel Ellsberg for turning the Pentagon Papers over to the NY Times and heralded Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward for their Watergate expose, but demanded that James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles be prosecuted for their ACORN videos and wanted the computer hackers who uncovered the East Anglia emails, the ones proving global warming to be a major hoax, to be tarred and feathered.I even remember when Time magazine put a group of highly publicized corporate whistle-blowers on their cover, hailing their courage and patriotism. Long before Time Magazine decided its cover boy would be Ben Bernanke, I was willing to wager that O’Keefe and Giles wouldn’t be Time’s 2009’s People of the Year.When George W. Bush convinced a mere 42 countries to join us in the invasion of Iraq, liberals insisted he had gone off half-cocked. However, when Obama couldn’t convince any country to take the Guantanamo prisoners off our hands and could only get 40 nations to commit to joining us in Afghanistan, those on the left insisted he was a master of diplomacy.The liberals keep telling us that, thanks to Obama’s policy of speaking endlessly and carrying a very small stick, America has gained renewed respect around the world. But, as usual, they don’t specify which countries respect us more these days now that they have good reason to fear us less. We know pretty darn well they’re not referring to Russia, Iran, Somalia, North Korea, Syria or China. They’re not even able to point to such erstwhile allies as Poland, Israel and the Czech Republic, all of whom are staggering around these days with American-made switchblades in their back.Liberals, as well as a great many conservatives, were upset with George W. Bush for his massive spending. But these days, when Obama is quadrupling the deficit, the Left is cheering him on. Can you imagine what liberals would be saying if a Republican president announced something as nutty as Obama’s promise to spend his way to solvency?For that matter, what would a typical liberal say if, after he broke the news that they were on the brink of bankruptcy, his wife’s response was to head out the front door, and when he asked her where she was going, she replied, “I’ll be back in a minute, honey, I’m just running out to pick up a few things at Tiffany’s”? Is there a jury in America that would find him guilty if he busted a chair over her head? But when it’s Obama going out the door to drop a few trillion on cap and trade and ObamaCare, the liberals just shake their heads like besotted newlyweds and say, “Isn’t he just cute as a button?”The worst thing about liberalism isn’t even the lying and the double standards, but the fact that it’s contagious. For example, not too long ago, I heard Bill O’Reilly state that it was good for America that Barack Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize. He said with a reasonably straight face that he liked the fact that the world saw us as a peaceful nation. I thought I could avoid such things by avoiding MSNBC. I was wrong. Instead, I thought my head would explode.Barack Obama got the Prize for the very same reason that Jimmy Carter got it. They got it because they weren’t George W. Bush. The wooly-headed leftists in Norway keep making stupid decisions, handing out these medallions to the likes of Le Duc Tho, Kofi Anan, Desmond Tutu and Yasser Arafat, and clucks like Carter and Obama keep jetting over to Oslo to be clucked over.If I were President Prelutsky and they tried to demean my reputation that way, I would not only reject the award, I would point out that the U.S. military has done more for the cause of world peace than all the diplomats and pacifists put together. Then I’d have someone teach me a little Norwegian so that I could tell them in their own language where they could put their damn Peace Prize."

In order to save her life, he threw her over his shoulder and held the wound with his hand as he and another officer quickly hacked their way through the overgrowth to get her out of the woods — and into the hands of an Arlington fire crew and a waiting helicopter from the U.S. Park Police.Kylie was flown to Friendship Hospital for Animals, though Ryan feared she would be lost during the trip.(D.C. Fire and EMS)Friendship Hospital Chief of Surgery Mathieu Glassman explained: “Any time there is blood loss, it’s pretty unforgiving. So by the time she had gotten here — a normal red cell percentage is about 40 percent or 45 percent — she was down to about 30 or so,” he said.Fortunately, the hardworking pup will not join the five K-9 units that have alreadybeen lostin 2019. By Wednesday afternoon she was released from the hospital and is headed home for a well-deserved rest with her grateful partner."

They certainly have lost me,” the former governor said in a recent episode ofHuckabee.“This is so outrageous that it’s hard to believe that the Disney Company has become such a purveyor of soft porn and wokeism, that instead of entertaining children with fantasy and magic, Disney’s new model is sexual fantasy, outright betrayal and rejection of traditional values of marriage and gender,” he added.Watch Below:“Instead of moral neutrality, Disney has opted for immoral advocacy,” Huckabee continued. “So I wonder will their remake of ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’ be called ‘The Nymphomaniac and the Seven Male Prostitutes’?”“I, for one, don’t want to enrich the people that have destroyed the Magic Kingdom and turned it into the perverted palace,” Huckabee affirmed.The former governor went on to say “Disney executives have outright lied about the Florida legislation that prohibits government schools from teaching sexual content to preschoolers and young elementary children.”“What person in his or her right mind would want a four year old child to be taught about homosexuality, transgenderism, and sexual expression?” he asked.File/People from the Walt Disney Company participate in the annual LA Pride Parade in West Hollywood, California, on June 9, 2019.

7319008360,https://www.breitbart.com/news/avenatti-hit-with-nike-extortion-claims-other-charges/,"Avenatti hit with Nike extortion claims, other charges","LOS ANGELES (AP) — A year ago, Michael Avenatti’s star was rising as the combative, media-savvy lawyer representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in her legal battles against President Donald Trump.He hammered the president as a regular fixture on cable news and baited and bashed critics on Twitter while flirting with his own run for the White House.Those days seemed like a distant memory as Avenatti was arrested Monday and federal prosecutors on both coasts announced charges that could send him to prison for the rest of his life.Avenatti tried to shake down Nike for as much as $25 million by using his prominent position to threaten the company with bad publicity, federal prosecutors said. He was also accused of stealing a client’s settlement money to pay his own expenses and filing fake tax returns to get $4 million in loans from a Mississippi bank to fund a lavish lifestyle.He was arrested at a New York law firm where he had gone to meet with Nike executives. It was just minutes after he tweeted that he planned to hold a news conference Tuesday to “disclose a major high school/college basketball scandal perpetrated by @Nike that we have uncovered.”“When lawyers use their law licenses as weapons, as a guise to extort payments for themselves, they are no longer acting as attorneys. They are acting as criminals,” said Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney in New York.Prosecutors in New York said their investigation began only last week while California investigators had been building a tax case against Avenatti for more than a year.The allegations “paint an ugly picture of lawless conduct and greed,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles. Avenatti describes himself on Twitter as “fighter for good,” but the accusations describe “a corrupt lawyer who instead fights for his own selfish interests.”Avenatti, 48, was ordered released on $300,000 bond after a brief court appearance Monday evening in New York. He did not enter a plea. Emerging from the courthouse, he said he expected to be cleared of the charges.“For the entirety of my career, I have fought against the powerful. Powerful people and powerful corporations. I will never stop fighting that good fight,” he said. “I am highly confident that when all the evidence is laid bare in connection with these cases, when it is all known, when due process occurs, that I will be fully exonerated and justice will be done.”Avenatti’s fame from the Daniels case made him a leading figure in the anti-Trump movement, with relentless cable news appearances, a hard-punching style and a knack for obtaining information about others’ wrongdoing.His sharp reversal of fortune led critics to hit back on Twitter. Donald Trump Jr., whom Avenatti inaccurately predicted would be charged in the investigation into ties between his father’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, gloated.“Good news for my friend @MichaelAvenatti, if you plead fast enough, you might just get to share a cell with Michael Cohen!” he wrote, referring to the former Trump lawyer set to go to prison next month for crimes that include orchestrating hush-money payments to Daniels. Trump Jr. mocked Avenatti by ending with the lawyer’s trademark hashtag #basta, an Italian word meaning “enough.”Prosecutors said Avenatti and a co-conspirator initially approached Nike on behalf of a client who coached an Amateur Athletic Union basketball program sponsored by the company in California.They claimed to have evidence of misconduct by Nike employees and threatened to hold a news conference last week on the eve of a company’s quarterly earnings call and the start of the NCAA tournament. Avenatti told Nike the company could either pay them $15 million to $25 million to investigate the allegations, or pay him more than $22 million for his silence, the criminal complaint said.Two people familiar with the investigation confirmed the unidentified co-conspirator was Mark Geragos , a Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer known for his work with celebrities. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was not made public by prosecutors.Geragos, a CNN contributor, has a client list that has included Michael Jackson, Winona Ryder, Scott Peterson, Colin Kaepernick and most recently Jussie Smollett, the actor accused of fabricating a racist, anti-gay attack in Chicago. Geragos did not respond to messages seeking comment. Within hours, CNN cut ties with him.While lawyers sometimes make demands to seek out-of-court settlements, it crosses the line to extortion if they threaten to go public with damaging information to get something of value or gain leverage in a civil dispute, attorney Neama Rahmani said.“The Department of Justice historically has been very cautious when charging attorneys, so they likely have evidence that Avenatti seriously crossed this line,” said Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor.Nike officials told investigators Avenatti claimed to know of rules violations by an amateur basketball team sponsored by Nike. Executives immediately reported the threats to federal authorities.The company “firmly believes in ethical and fair play, both in business and sports, and will continue to assist the prosecutors,” Nike said in a statement.Avenatti rose to national prominence by representing Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in a lawsuit to break a confidentiality agreement to speak about her alleged affair with Trump. He also made headlines in recent weeks representing two women who accused R&B star R. Kelly of sexual abuse.Daniels said she was “saddened but not shocked” by the arrest. She issued a statement Monday on Twitter saying she fired Avenatti a month ago after “discovering that he had dealt with me extremely dishonestly.” She said she would not elaborate.While Avenatti’s lawsuit effectively tore up the gag order that threatened financial penalties if Daniels spoke about the case, a defamation lawsuit filed on her behalf against Trump backfired, and a court ordered her to pay the president’s $293,000 in legal fees.Avenatti himself has been dogged with tax and financial troubles in recent years.A U.S. bankruptcy court ordered his former firm to pay $10 million to a lawyer who claimed it had misstated its profits.The bank fraud case involved $4 million in loans he got from The Peoples Bank in Biloxi, which prosecutors said he obtained by filing fraudulent tax returns claiming $14 million in income over three years. However, he never filed tax returns those years, nor paid the $2.8 million he reported on the forms. In fact, he still owed more than $850,000 to the IRS at the time for previous income.Mark Pearson, the assistant agent in charge of IRS criminal investigations in Los Angeles, said Avenatti’s crimes supported a $200,000-a-month lifestyle, a car racing venture and pricey homes in the wealthy Orange County communities of Newport Beach and Laguna Beach.Convictions on all charges carry up to 47 years in the New York case and 50 years in the California case, prosecutors said.___Melley reported from Los Angeles.

5429034232,http://www.breitbart.com/news/daughter-of-woman-at-center-of-south-korean-scandal-arrested-in-denmark/,Daughter of woman at center of South Korean scandal arrested in Denmark,"AALBORG, Denmark, Jan. 2 (UPI) — Local authorities in Denmark have arrested Chung Yoo-ra, daughter of Choi Soon-sil, who is currently ensnared at the center of the growing South Korean political scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye and her parliamentary impeachment last month.Thought to be in Germany, Chung avoided authorities for several days. South Korean officials had recruited the help of German police and Interpol in an attempt to invalidate her passport and track her down, but it was a group of South Korean journalists who tipped off Danish authorities to her whereabouts.Chung was one of five South Korean nationals apprehended by police in Aalborg. All five are believed to have been staying in the country illegally. Danish officials are currently in talks with South Korea’s Foreign Ministry over Chung’s deportation back to her home country, where she is wanted for questioning.“We will request her emergency extradition, working with the special prosecutor’s office,” Lee Chul-sung, chief of South Korea’s National Police Agency, said at a press conference on Monday.Chung’s mom, Choi, has been dubbed “Rasputin” by the South Korean press for her undue influence over President Park. Choi and Park have been accused of corruption. Choi, specifically, is alleged to have used her position of influence to secure “donations” from large corporate conglomerates, like Samsung — donations she then used to fund her family’s lavish lifestyle.Choi is also accused of using her political influence to secure her daughter’s apparently underserving entrance into an elite Seoul university. College admissions are extremely competitive in South Korea, where students spend years cramming for entrance exams. Chung’s family also allegedly pressured teachers into giving her high marks despite her poor academic performance.Chung is a member of the national equestrian team and is believed to have a visa that allows her to train in Germany. But she was found staying in a Denmark flat with her one-year-old infant son, a nanny and two male body guards.Chung’s lawyer told officials his client is prepared to answer any questions relating to her mother’s corruption allegations."

6432183716,http://www.breitbart.com/news/gun-industry-gathers-just-a-few-miles-from-mass-shooting/,Gun industry gathers just a few miles from mass shooting,"The gun industry is holding its biggest annual trade show this week just a few miles from where a gunman slaughtered 58 concertgoers outside his high-rise Las Vegas hotel room in October using a display case worth of weapons, many of them fitted with bump stocks that enabled them to mimic fully automatic fire.What exactly will be among the thousands of products crammed into the exhibition spaces at the National Shooting Sports Foundation’s SHOT Show convention, running from Tuesday through Friday, will be a bit of a mystery, shielded from the public and, this year, members of the general-interest media.One thing is known: Slide Fire, the leading manufacturer of bump stocks, a once-obscure product that attracted intense attention in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, won’t be among the exhibitors.The Texas-based company hasn’t said why it’s not on the roster of more than 1,700 exhibitors, although it was last year. It didn’t return messages seeking comment. The company also isn’t on the list of those attending this year’s National Rifle Association annual meeting or other prominent gun trade shows.In the aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre Oct. 1, Slide Fire had so much trouble keeping up with demand it temporarily stopped taking orders for the product. It has since resumed.“From purely from a public relations standpoint, it wouldn’t be a surprise at all if bump stocks just sort of disappeared this year,” said Robert Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment. “That’s a PR no-brainer.”Still, the convention floor is likely to have plenty of other devices that gun-control advocates have taken aim at in recent years: accessories that make it easier to carry a firearm, shoot it or reduce the noise it makes.On the list of products they oppose are “trigger cranks,” which, like bump stocks, make it easier to fire a long gun rapidly, and “assault pistols,” which look remarkably like short-barreled AR- and AK-style firearms but skirt certain federal restrictions because they aren’t designed to be shot from the shoulder.“For a person from the general public, I think the thing that would startle them the most about the SHOT Show … is just the sheer scope and the vastness of this show,” said David Chipman, a former agent with the federal agency that regulates firearms and now a senior policy adviser with the gun safety organization founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a shooting in 2012.SHOT Show has been held for 40 years, half that time in Las Vegas, and this year’s gathering was scheduled well before the bloodshed last fall. It will have some 13 miles of aisles featuring products from more than 1,700 companies. More than 65,000 visitors are expected at the gathering, a place where connections are made and deals worth millions are struck.The general public is not allowed to roam the aisles; the only people who can attend are those with direct ties to the industry: manufacturers and dealers of firearms or associated products. Although a few reporters from general-interest news organizations attended in recent years, NSSF this year restricted access to about 2,500 journalists from trade publications and media.The show’s location and timing 3½ months after Stephen Paddock’s murderous attack have heightened awareness of the event.Michael Bazinet, NSSF director of public affairs, said that while those attending are well aware of the tragedy that occurred nearby, “they also know that legal gun ownership and the lawful commerce of arms is something quite removed from the act of an individual such as this. And that’s not to diminish the tragedy at all. But people come to the show do make that distinction.”The show comes as the gun industry’s fortunes have waned after nearly a decade of unprecedented sales. No longer concerned about the federal government restricting gun rights, Americans have scaled back their firearm-buying sprees.When SHOT Show, which stands for Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade, was launched, its emphasis was on hunting and the outdoors. Over the decades, it has evolved and grown and now has huge sections devoted to the law enforcement and military community. No sales are allowed at the show, firing pins are removed from all guns on display, and there is no live ammunition.There are so many companies that want to exhibit, there isn’t enough space. The waiting list is several hundred names long.Kevin Michalowski, executive editor of Concealed Carry Magazine, has been going to SHOT Show for more than a decade and said he doesn’t anticipate this year’s event will have a different feel from other years. He said it’s a close-knit industry accustomed to being put under the microscope by the media and by gun-control advocates.“This is not just a group of redneck gun owners as are often portrayed by the mainstream media. This is serious business,” he said. “Millions and millions of dollars are exchanged, and it helps the economies of many, many states, it helps the economy of the U.S.”"
4771037037,http://www.breitbart.com/news/third-day-of-yemen-peace-talks-winds-up-without-progress/,Third day of Yemen peace talks winds up without progress,"Kuwait City (AFP) – A third day of UN-brokered peace negotiations in Kuwait between the Yemeni government and rebels wound up Saturday without progress, sources close to the talks said.The sources told AFP the two sides remained far apart, especially on the need to firm up a fragile ceasefire that went into effect on April 11.There was no official comment from UN envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, who told reporters on Friday that the delegations had held “constructive” talks and were committed to strengthening the truce.The truce was still only being 70-80 percent respected, he acknowledged, adding there were violations by both sides.The negotiations in Kuwait opened late Thursday after the delayed arrival of representatives of the Huthi rebels and allied forces loyal to ousted president Ali Abdullah Saleh.The Iran-backed Shiite Huthi rebels are insisting on a halt to air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition which is supporting the government, ahead of other issues, the sources said.President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi’s delegation, for its part, is demanding the rebels lift sieges of cities, especially Taez, and release prisoners as part of confidence-building measures.The government delegation has submitted a complaint listing 260 alleged ceasefire violations by the rebels on Friday alone, according to the sources.Rebel delegation spokesman Mohamed Abdulsalam said the priority was to end the fighting that has killed more than 6,800 people and driven 2.8 million from their homes since March last year.“Stopping the war and all forms of military action is the priority,” he said on Facebook.On Saturday, three rebels and two loyalists were killed in clashes in Kirsh, a town on the highway to Taez from the southern port city of Aden where Hadi’s government is based, military sources said.Loyalist forces in Taez, Yemen’s third largest city, have been under rebel siege for months.On another battlefront not covered by the ceasefire, pro-Hadi forces backed by air power from the  Arab coalition launched an operation Saturday to drive Al-Qaeda fighters out of a southern provincial capital, Yemeni military officials said.The forces in Abyan province advanced towards Zinjibar and the neighbouring town of Jaar, the sources said.Military and medical sources said 25 Al-Qaeda militants and four soldiers were killed.Troops also reached the government complex on the southern edge of Zinjibar and fighting raged around the compound, military officials said.Government forces last week expelled Al-Qaeda militants from Huta, the capital of Lahj province, as part of operations to secure southern provinces."

Also in 2016, he tweeted: “Beyoncés music is complete trash.” In 2018, he tweeted: “Black Panther worst Marvel movie of all time.”But ShermantoldtheSacramento Beethat as long as Bosa plays well, his past social media posts, which have been deleted, will be forgotten.“One thing about football is that nobody really cares what you say if you can play,” Sherman said. “At the end of the day, I think a guy that has played with African Americans his whole life, not saying he can’t be racist, but they know how to maneuver around African Americans.”Kaepernick started the anthem protest movement in the summer of 2016 as a member of these same 49ers, because, as he put it, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”Kaepernick felt some police officers got away with murder after shooting unarmed black suspects.“To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,” Kaepernicksaid. “There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”Kaepernick, who is currently a free agent,woresocks to a 49ers practice in 2016 with police depicted as pigs. Bosa called Kaepernick “a clown” on Twitter in August, 2016, right after the quarterback began the anthem-kneeling movement.Sherman supported Kaepernick’s cause, though he didn’t think kneeling during the anthem was the best approach.“It’s because people aren’t even getting the point,” Shermansaid. “He’s going out there and making a stand and you might as well be saying, ‘blah blah blah blah blah.’ Because people are just seeing you kneel during the national anthem, and they’re taking that and closing their ears. And that’s unfortunate. I think [Kaepernick’s] intent was pure. His heart was pure, he was trying to do the right thing. But in our society, you’ve got to find the right way to do the right thing so people don’t close their ears.”If Bosa, a skillful pass rusher out of Ohio State, gets to the quarterback and compiles sacks, Sherman thinks he should be fine.“It’s not like something where guys are like, ‘Hey man, what about what you said?’ No. No. If he can play, he can play. If he can’t play, he won’t be here,” Sherman said. “But at the end of the day, that’s all that matters in football. Is he getting sacks on Sunday? Is he helping our team? Is he being a good teammate? Those are things that matter. Now if he’s a bad teammate, that’s something we’ll address.”It’s unclear what Sherman means by “bad teammate.”Bosa also expressed support for President Donald J. Trump in the past. After Bosa was picked in the draft on April 27, Trump offered congratulations on Twitter:“Big Talent! San Francisco will embrace you but most importantly, always stay true to yourself. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trumptweeted.In his introductory press conference in San Francisco after being drafted, Bosa wascontriteabout his past tweets.“I definitely made some insensitive decisions throughout my life, and I’m just excited to be here with a clean slate,” Bosa said. “I’m sorry if I hurt anybody. I definitely didn’t intend for that to be the case, but I think me being here is even better for me as a person because I don’t think there’s any city that you could really be in that would help you grow as much as this one will.“I’m going to be surrounded by people, all different kinds, so I’m going to grow as a person and I’m going to be on my own. College, you have kind of like that support system around you. Now I’m here, I’m going to be on my own, I’m going to grow up, I’m going to learn a lot of new things.”But Sherman thinks Bosa should be fine moving forward.“I think, at the end of the day, your beliefs are your beliefs, but when you’re in the building and you’re a football player and you’re a teammate, you handle yourself accordingly,” Sherman said. “And I think he understands that.”"

Vice President Mike Pence had been scheduled to deliver the keynote address. However, the VP couldn’t attend because he’sleadingthe U.S. Olympic delegation at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics.Wentz should have no trouble though. The second-year signal caller delivered a sermon in his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, last summer. In his message, Wentz said, “The myth in our world, in our society,” Wentztoldthe parishioners on June 28 according to WDAY TV in Fargo, “and even in the church, is that if I just have faith in Jesus, and I do enough good, that I’ll have salvation. You see that’s wrong.“The truth is faith alone in Jesus Christ is what equals salvation plus the works. It’s not just for the pastors to tell the world about Jesus. They can’t reach the majority of people that we can. We all have to work together to make a difference.”He quoted Ephesians 2:8-10 in his sermon, which reads, “For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”Wentz played well last year, leading the Eagles to the top of the NFC before tearing his ACL in a late-season match-up against the Rams. The Eagles have said that there will be no quarterback controversy going into next season, Wentz will be the starter."

Sall, who was seen there earlier in the evening, did not speak.Official results from each region are not expected until Tuesday with a nationwide announcement by Friday midnight at the latest. If no one wins more than 50 percent a second-round runoff will be held on March 24.Shortly before Dionne’s announcement, Sall’s two main challengers had warned against premature proclamations of victory.“At this stage, a second round is announced and the results that are already compiled allow us to say so,” said former prime minister Idrissa Seck, who was making his third run for president.“At the current state of the vote count, no candidate, I say no candidate, including myself, can claim to have won the presidential election,” taxman-turned MP Ousmane Sonko, who was also in the race, added at their joint press conference.Seck and Sonko are the only two candidates seen as having a chance of making it to a second round, with incumbent Sall, 56, in the lead in many polling stations, according to preliminary results reported in the evening by local media.The other challengers, former foreign minister Madicke Niang and Issa Sall of the Unity and Assembly Party (PUR), were trailing far behind, according to the results.Macky Sall had looked set to cruise to victory in the first round after his two key rivals, popular former Dakar mayor Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade, son of the previous president, were banned from running over graft convictions and he only faced four lesser-known candidates.“At the end of this day, the Senegalese people alone will be the winner. And the president chosen will equally have to be president of all Senegalese,” Sall said after voting Sunday.A geologist by training, Sall took over as president in 2012 after beating his former mentor Abdoulaye Wade, and this time, he has campaigned for a second term championing his “Emerging Senegal” infrastructure project to boost economic growth.“Victory in the first round is indisputable,” Sall told a recent Dakar campaign rally.The EU observation mission said its overall assessment was “quite positive” among the polling stations it observed.“There has been very little violence, very isolated incidents, which is very good news,” said Elena Valenciano, head of the mission.– A smaller lineup –Often held up as a model of stability in Africa, Senegal has enjoyed strong growth. The Muslim-majority country has largely escaped the jihadist attacks that destabilised neighbours such as Mali.Sall has made transport infrastructure a priority. But basic services, healthcare and education often remain inadequate, sometimes triggering strikes and protests.The other four candidates have campaigned hard against his plans for a second phase of his project, which critics see as a potential debt burden.The five-horse race leaves voters with a limited choice compared to 2012 when 14 candidates vied for the top post.A new system approved by parliament last year requires candidates demonstrate support from a minimum number of citizens and regions.Once the regulations went into force, only seven candidates made the cut, but two of them — Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade — were then disqualified.Both men were barred over their convictions for misuse of public funds, which they say were engineered to bar them from the race.Their supporters staged a number of protests and last year, Amnesty International issued a report highlighting the “unfair trials” of senior opposition figures, flagging a “lack of (judicial) independence” in the case against Khalifa Sall.Senegal has a population of 16 million but only 6.7 million were registered to vote in the West African nation which gained independence from France in 1960.Senegal has known two peaceful power transfers in 2000 and 2012 and has never experienced any coups. But election campaigns are often marred by charges of corruption, disinformation and sometimes violence.For polling day, some 8,000 police were deployed throughout urban areas alongside an unspecified number of civilian security staff, officials said.And around 5,000 observers — including some from the European Union — were monitoring proceedings, the interior ministry said."

The U.S. and much of the world fears Iran’s enrichment of uranium and other activity could be designed to make nuclear weapons; Iran says its program is meant only to generate power and for other peaceful purposes.The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly on this past week’s confidential negotiations, said the sanctions annex was completed this week by experts from Iran and the six world powers in the negotiations: the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. They did not provide details of the agreement.A senior U.S. official did not dispute the diplomats’ account but said work remained to be done on “Annex II” before the issue could be described as finalized. And beyond a political agreement that was still in the draft stage, details also needed to be finalized on tough issues contained in four other appendices.They include inspection guidelines, rules governing Iran’s research and development of advanced nuclear technology and the nuts and bolts of reducing the size and output of Iran’s uranium enrichment program.As part of a deal, the Obama administration also wants Iran to fully cooperate with the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency’s investigation of allegations that Tehran worked secretly on nuclear arms — something Iran vehemently denies. But chances of progress on that issue appear to be dimming.IAEA chief Yukiya Amano told reporters on Saturday that “more work will be needed” to advance the probe, in a statement similar to previous ones from his agency, which has struggled for nearly a decade to resolve its concerns.While saying he could wrap up his investigation by the end of the year, Amano said he needs Tehran’s cooperation to do so. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said after Thursday’s meeting in Tehran with Amano that the agency now understands that the “pointless allegations” are “baseless.”Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have made repeated demands for economic penalties to be lifted shortly after a deal is reached. Washington and its partners have said they’d take action after Iran verifiably complies with restrictions on enrichment and other elements of the nuclear program.Much of the negotiation on the matter has concerned sequencing, so that both sides can legitimately claim to have gotten their way.Several other matters related to sanctions also had posed problems.The Obama administration cannot move too quickly to remove economic penalties because of Congress, which will have a 30-day review period for any agreement during which no sanctions can be waived.American officials also had been struggling to separate the “nuclear-related” sanctions it is prepared to suspend from those it wishes to keep, including measures designed to counteract Iranian ballistic missile efforts, human rights violations and support for U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.And to keep pressure on Iran, world powers had been hoping to finalize a system for snapping suspended sanctions back into force if Iran cheats on the accord. Russia has traditionally opposed any plan that would see them lose their U.N. veto power and a senior Russian negotiator said only this week that his government rejected any automatic “snapback” of sanctions."

He bides his time by reading and writing and working at the facility’s recreational center.Nearly two years after Sterling was found guilty of leaking government secrets to a reporter, the 49-year-old maintains that he is innocent. Sterling is now pinning his hopes for an early release on a federal appeals court, which will soon consider whether to reverse his convictions.“I continue to have hope that the truth will come out,” said his wife Holly Sterling, who travels to the prison from their home in Missouri once a month to visit her husband. Sterling is serving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence at an all-male prison that also houses former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and ex-Subway spokesman Jared Fogle.A jury convicted Sterling on all counts last year after he was charged under the Espionage Act for leaking details of a CIA mission to New York Times journalist James Risen. The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments in Sterling’s case on Tuesday.Prosecutors portrayed Sterling as a disgruntled former employee who exposed a plan to stall Iranian ambitions to build a nuclear weapon in an attempt to discredit the CIA. That operation involved using a CIA agent nicknamed “Merlin” to deliver flawed nuclear blueprints to Iran in the hopes that they would spend years trying to develop a product that would never work.Risen described the mission in his 2006 book “State of War.” Citing anonymous sources, Risen suggested it was a reckless and botched operation that may have actually helped advance the Iranians’ nuclear program. The CIA has strongly disputed that idea.“Sterling’s actions destroyed the program, endangered the lives of a covert human asset and his family, and compromised the United States’ ability to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,” prosecutors wrote in their appeals court brief. US Attorney Dana Boente’s office declined to comment ahead of the 4th Circuit hearing.Sterling has maintained that he was not Risen’s source, and Risen never testified during trial. His attorneys argued that the leak likely came from a Capitol Hill staffer after Sterling shared his concerns about the program with staffers at a Senate intelligence committee in 2003.His attorneys and other advocates claim prosecutors only went after Sterling because Risen’s story made the CIA look foolish.“If Risen had written a story about how this was a superb operation that successfully set back the Iranian nuclear program, I don’t think there is any chance whatsoever that Mr. Sterling would have been charged,” said Barry Pollack, who represented Sterling at trial.On appeal, Sterling’s attorneys argue that, among other things, his conviction should be reversed because prosecutors never proved that Sterling ever disclosed any secret information in the Eastern District of Virginia, where the case was tried.They also argue that the lower court inappropriately allowed prosecutors to tell jurors about Sterling’s mishandling of other CIA documents. His attorneys are urging the 4th Circuit to grant Sterling a new trial.Sterling’s prison sentence currently expires in 2018, but his wife said he may be released as early as next December if he maintains good behavior.Holly Sterling said her husband has recently been struggling with health issues and fears he could die in prison. She said she knows that the odds that the 4th Circuit will side with Sterling are long, but she remains hopeful.“We are very confident in our attorneys, we are very confident that it can be overturned,” Sterling said."

This article was written by “M.A. Navarro” from Ciudad Victoria.CIUDAD VICTORIA, Tamaulipas — Despite the many assurances by state officials about the improving security conditions in this border state, two rival factions of the Los Zetas cartel continue to fight for control of this city while terrorizing average citizens.As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, two rival factions of Los Zetas, one called Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) and one called “Vieja Escuela” (Old School) or “Grupo Bravo,” have been at odds over control of the region which has resulted in shootouts, executions, dismemberments and dozens of threatening banners being hung throughout the city.One of those banners that was hung in this city caused alarm through social media since it warned members of the CDN that they had 24 hours to begin taking their families out of the city or they would too become targets.The banner also warns two prominent car towing businesses, local bars and other businesses aligned with CDN to switch sides or meet an early demise. The banner also criticizes Tamaulipas state authorities accusing them of arresting vagrants and passing them off as cartel gunmen.Just one day after the banner was hung, multiple executions and violent attacks took place throughout the city.Also last week, cartel gunmen executed a man just moments after he was released from the state prison in the Tamatan neighborhood. Authorities confirmed to Breitbart Texas that Juan Jose Gonzalez Castillo had just been released from the state prison before his murder. An acquaintance who had arrived to pick him up at the prison facility was also injured in the shooting.Breitbart Texas was able to obtain a photograph of Gonzalez’s release papers from prison, the documents show what appears to be a bullet hole in the documents."

Now, security agencies believe Islamic State may be radicalising and recruiting migrants who have already successfully crossed the continent’s borders and passed through vetting processes,reportsVoice of America.“We have to be ready,” said Fabrice Leggeri, executive director of Frontex, the EU border and coast guard agency, prior to theBerlin Christmas market attack.“Some people might get radicalized or manipulated or used or utilized by terrorist groups after they enter the EU,” he said. “This is something where I don’t have clear indications.”Areportreleased in December by Europol’s European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC), “Changes in Modus Operandi of IS Revisited”, states, “A real and imminent danger is the possibility of elements of the (Sunni Muslim) Syrian refugee diaspora becoming vulnerable to radicalisation once in Europe and being specifically targeted by Islamic extremist recruiters.”The report continued, “It is believed that a number of jihadists are travelling through Europe for this purpose. According to unconfirmed information, German authorities were aware of around 300 recorded attempts made by jihadists to recruit refugees who were trying to enter Europe by April 2016.”“ISIS just wants to give itself options,” said Robin Simcox, a terrorism and national security analyst with the Heritage Foundation.“It chimes perfectly with what ISIS would want to do,” he added. “It enables them to extend their foreign operations.”Anis Amri, who drove a truck through the Berlin Christmas market on Monday 19 December killing 12 and injuring over 50, was described by his father as a violent, drug-taking troublemaker in his youth in Tunisia – but not religious.It was not until he had travelled illegally to Europe following the Arab Spring in March 2011 that he was reportedly radicalised in an Italian jail, before travelling on to Germany where he presented himself as a Syrian and applied for asylum. Amri was shot dead by Italian police after pulling a weapon on and shooting an officer on the morning of Friday the 23rd of December.Through its Amaq news service, Islamic State released a martyrdom video of Amriswearing allegianceto the caliphate and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Jenan Moussa, a reporter for Al Aan TV, based out of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, provided a translation of what Amri said in the video, describing it as evidence that he “isn’t a lone wolf after all – at least he was in touch with ISIS media.”Amri said in the recording, “I call my brothers everywhere, make Jihad in the name of God and support this religion’s [duty] … If you are in Europe fight these crusade[r] pigs.”"
967133994,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA32T9K81,"After stunning loss, Pacquiao faces tough choices","(AP) After stunning loss, Pacquiao faces tough choicesBy HRVOJE HRANJSKIAssociated PressMANILA, PhilippinesManny Pacquiao has already achieved what most of his countrymen can only dream of: lifting himself out of wrenching poverty, securing a future for his children and becoming a hero to Filipinos the world over.Not content with just winning in the ring, Pacquiao also set about making his mark in politics.But after his stunning loss to Juan Manuel Marquez in Las Vegas on Saturday, the 34-year-old is facing some of the toughest questions of his remarkable 17-year career: does his future lay in boxing, politics, show business, religion, or perhaps there’s even a new challenge on the horizon?“Being the king of boxing, being the highest paid athlete in boxing … it goes with the territory,” boxing analyst Ed Tolentino said. “For Pacquiao, the fame was too much to handle. There was just too many things on his plate other than boxing.”The distraction was costly for Pacquiao, who trained for two months, compared to 4 1/2 for Marquez.During that time the Mexican bulked up and became more muscular to withstand the blows from Pacquiao that proved so damaging in their three previous encounters.Pacquiao grew up a survivor and fighter, overcoming poverty and cut-throat competition in a country where half of the population lives on $2 a day and 3,000 leave for jobs overseas every day.He left high school to work as a baker and a construction worker to earn money for his mother and siblings after his father left them. As a scrawny teenager, he was a stowaway on a ship that took him from his southern hometown of General Santos City to the capital, Manila, where he took up boxing while working as a laborer.After finding success in local bouts, Pacquiao began his international career in the late 1990s. In the next decade, he became a household name by clinching eight world titles in eight weight categories. At home, he was declared a hero, “the people’s champ” _ an inspiration to the legions of the poor, and the man the rich and powerful wanted to rub shoulders with.As the titles, honors and money started pouring in, so did distractions.Politicians, minor actors and an assortment of hangers-on formed his huge entourage.“You only need a Ferris wheel and his training camp would have been a circus,” Tolentino said.In a nation where celebrities, money and politics equal a winning formula, Pacquiao played his card by running for Congress in 2007, but lost.The most popular face in town, he turned to crooning his own songs. His picture endorsed countless products. He’s a regular on TV, and hosts his own show. He’s made a movie. Another passion is cock fighting, a traditional past time in the Philippines.He was Pacquiao Inc.Showbiz “takes a lot of time, a lot of energy. You have to prepare for these shows,” said boxing commentator Ronnie Nathanielsz. “(Pacquiao) loses focus because he has so many things to worry about and attend to.”Pacquiao was elected to Congress from his southern Sarangani province in 2010, and has announced he will run for re-election next year. Taking a cue from his political allies, he appears to be building a political organization, with his wife, Jinkee, running for vice governor, and younger brother, Rogelio, for congress in neighboring South Cotabato province.In the meantime, he promised to clean up his act: no more gambling, drinking and womanizing, and took up preaching the Bible. Some called it a public relations stunt for a budding politician, but Pacquiao insisted it was for real.“To those who think that way, let us leave them be. I will pray for them. Even Jesus Christ, even after he performed miracles, no one believed him, what more for a sinner like me,” he said, adding he did not want to be a pastor but share how “the Lord changed my life.”Then came the first blow: a controversial decision awarding his June fight to Timothy Bradley. Questions arose if Pacquiao was showing the wear of 17 years in the ring, and whether the distractions catching up with him.Saturday’s loss to Marquez, whom he had beaten twice and drawn once, only made the question more urgent, although Pacquiao made no mention of a possible retirement.“Among boxers, they don’t have the word retirement in their dictionary. It’s so hard to admit that all of sudden it’s over, especially for Pacquiao,” Tolentino said.“His demotion was from the penthouse to the doghouse,” he added. “I think really there has to be a lot of soul searching. … He has to consult his family, his real entourage.”___Associated Press writer Oliver Teves contributed to this report."

LOUIS, Jan. 5 (UPI) — New research suggests a native Missouri bee species is skewing the reproductive patterns of wildflower morphs — a variance of leaf or flower petal patterns — in cooler forests.Peter Bernhardt, a professor of biology at Saint Louis University, discovered a discrepancy among the morph ratios of birds foot violet flowers, Viola pedata, in different Missouri habitats. His research suggests the discrepancy is the result of the preferences of native bees.Under most conditions, the Carlin’s bee, Andrena carlinii, prefers the concolor morph to the bicolor morph. The concolor version features five light violet-mauve petals, while the bicolor form is accented by two dark purple petals on top.In a sunny open field, Bernhardt and his researcher partners found a ratio of 40 to one, concolor to bicolor. But a violet population in a section of shady woods featured a more even split.Bernhardt hypothesized the bees took to the bicolor morphs in woods as they offer the bees warmth on cool spring days as the sun moves through the forest and heats up the darker colored petals. He and his fellow field researchers observed bees always feeding upside down, so the bees backside would be warmed by the top pedals.Sure enough, a thermocouple and a hypodermic tissue probe revealed the dark petals to be 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the surrounding air when warmed by rays of sun peering through the forest canopy. In the sunny glade, warmth is abundant, but in the forest it’s less available and more appreciated.“Remember how you were told that a dark coat keeps you a little warmer on a cold but sunny day?” Bernhardt said in a news release. “Some plants blooming in chilly environments have dark purple or almost black patches on their flowers to keep cold-blooded insects toasty warm as they pollinate.”Bernhardt and his colleagues detailed their investigation of the unique bee-violet relationship in the Journal of Pollination Ecology."

They didn’t say whether Yelich might be able to return for the playoffs that begin Oct. 1 if they make it that far — Milwaukee is one game behind the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild-card spot.Yelich hit .329 with 44 home runs and 97 RBIs along with 30 stolen bases. He was leading the majors in slugging percentage and OPS when he was hurt.Mike Moustakas celebrated his 31st birthday by returning to the lineup Wednesday and placed in Yelich’s third spot in the batting order. Moustakas had been sidelined since Sept. 5 because of a sprained left wrist. He is hitting .260 with 31 home runs and a .571 slugging percentage.“Any time any member of your team gets hurt, especially with an injury that takes you out for the rest of the season, it’s devastating,” Moustakas said. “For it to happen to Yeli, obviously our best player and one of the best players in baseball, it’s devastating. There are no other words to describe it.”“But on the other side of things we have to figure out ways to make up for his production and that is obviously an incredible task for how great a competitor he is,” he said.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

Once they did so, hesaid, Democrats would be “happy” to debate all the GOP’s amendments, “including Vitter’s stupid amendment.”In response, Vitter read from a 1993 speech Reid gave in which he voiced support for ending birthright citizenship.“Even Harry Reid has acknowledged that it’s crazy to grant birthright citizenship to every child born in the U.S. It’s an absolute magnet that encourages more illegal aliens to come here,” Vitter said on the Senate floor Thursday.The Louisiana Republican first introduced his bill to end birth right citizenship in 2011. He reintroduced it earlier this year and recently sought to attach it to the human trafficking bill.The amendment follows a raid on a number of Southern California locations being used for “birth tourism,” where pregnant foreign nationals — in these cases Chinese women — come to the U.S. to give birth so that their children are U.S. citizens and afforded all the benefits that go with that.“We have a whole industry of birth tourism, which highlights just one part of our very broken immigration system,” Vitter said. “Ending birthright citizenship would dramatically improve this situation.”Watch:"

5297959301,http://www.breitbart.com/news/mass-rally-kicks-off-in-seoul-calling-for-parks-ouster/,Mass rally kicks off in Seoul calling for Park’s ouster,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Tens, and possibly hundreds, of thousands of South Koreans marched in Seoul on Saturday demanding the ouster of President Park Geun-hye in what one of the biggest protests in the country since its democratization about 30 years ago.Police anticipated about 170,000 people to turn out near City Hall and an old palace gate while the protest organizers estimated as much as a million are taking part.It’s the latest of a wave of massive rallies against Park, whose presidency has been shaken by suspicion that she let a shadowy longtime confidante to manipulate power from behind the scenes.Park’s friend, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader who emerged as Park’s mentor in the 1970s, is also suspected of exploiting her presidential ties to bully companies into donating tens of millions of dollars to foundations she controlled.Despite rising public anger, opposition parties have yet to seriously push for Park’s resignation or impeachment over fears of negatively impacting next year’s presidential race. However, they have threatened to campaign for resignation if she doesn’t distance herself from state affairs.The protest on Saturday is expected to be the largest in the capital since June 10, 2008, when police said 80,000 people took part in a candlelight vigil denouncing the government’s decision to resume U.S. beef imports amid persisting mad cow fears. Organizers then estimated the crowd at 700,000.In the summer of 1987, millions of South Koreans rallied in Seoul and other cities for weeks before the then-military government caved in to demands for free presidential elections.In an attempt to stabilize the situation, Park on Tuesday said she would let the opposition-controlled parliament choose her prime minister. But opposition parties say her words are meaningless without specific promises about transferring much of her presidential powers to a new No. 2.Prosecutors have arrested Choi, one of her key associates and two former presidential aides who allegedly helped Choi interfere with government decisions and amass an illicit fortune at the expense of businesses.Prosecutors also on Friday summoned the chairman of steelmaker POSCO over allegations that Choi and her associates tried to forcibly take over the shares of an advertisement company previously owned by the steelmaker.On Tuesday, they raided the headquarters of smartphone giant Samsung Electronics, the country’s largest company, which is under suspicion of spending millions of dollars illicitly financing the equestrian training of Choi’s athlete daughter.Under South Korea’s criminal litigation law, which requires suspects to be either indicted or released within 20 days of their arrest, prosecutors have until Nov. 20 to formally charge Choi.There is also a possibility that prosecutors will eventually investigate Park, who in a televised apology last week said she would accept a direct investigation into her action. The president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, under South Korean law, but she can be investigated.Park has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days."

8908595589,https://www.breitbart.com/news/dutch-covid-surge-fuelled-by-liberal-ways-say-experts/,"Dutch Covid surge fuelled by liberal ways, say experts","Even before it became a hotspot for Omicron variant cases, the Netherlands was one of the countries worst hit by the latest wave of Covid-19.Experts say that the spike despite an 85 percent adult vaccination rate is partly due to very Dutch ideas of personal freedom and social responsibility.Masks often remain unworn and Covid passes unchecked as the government shies away from enforcing its guidelines.This approach reflects a long-standing reliance on a “social contract” between citizens and authorities to keep this low-lying nation’s head above the waves.At the start of the pandemic, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced an “intelligent lockdown” that was more lax than much of Europe.“We don’t work like that in the Netherlands, where the government says ‘you have to do this, you have to do that,'” Rutte said in March 2020.At first the Dutch, used to a highly consensual political system, complied.“We were shoulder to shoulder against the virus,” recalls Mark Bonten, an epidemiologist and government adviser.‘Aversion to rules’But things have changed since then, with the increasingly unpopular Dutch government caught in a cycle of lifting restrictions too quickly, and then reimposing them.Cases recently soared to record daily levels of more than 20,000 cases in a country of 17 million people. The Netherlands had the fourth most cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe over the past week, according to an AFP database.Hospital intensive care units have become overwhelmed, operations have been cancelled while the army has been brought in to help.The Netherlands has also suffered some of its worst riots in decades, most recently when violence erupted in several cities in November.The goodwill towards the government’s restrictions has “dramatically eroded”, Bonten said.“Dutch people cherish their autonomy. Free will is in the nature of the country.”Epidemiologist Frits Rosendaal highlights the contrast between the Netherlands and Mediterranean countries such as Italy, which were badly hit by the first wave of Covid and are now more likely to respect Covid measures.“There is aversion to the rules, and aversion from the people in power to enforce the rules,” the Leiden University scientist told AFP. “There is no other difference with the other countries. This is just behaviour.”The Dutch government declined to comment despite multiple requests by AFP.‘Stick to the measures’Dutch authorities insist on the success of their vaccination campaign, which has now jabbed 85 percent of adults despite getting off to one of the slowest starts in Europe.The remaining portion of unvaccinated people “accounts for 70 percent of the hospitalisation in intensive care”, Aura Timen, infectious diseases chief of the RIVM National Public Health Institute, told AFP.A combination of other factors is also at play, including that vaccines do not offer absolute protection; the infectiousness of the Delta variant; the Netherlands’ high population density; and the increased spread of the virus in winter.But Timen also placed the onus on Dutch people to stick to the government’s newest restrictions, under which shops and restaurants close at 5pm.“I hope that people in the Netherlands will stick to the measures, because they only work if people comply with them,” Timen added.Cases “stabilised” last week in the wake of a first set of Covid curbs, rising by just one percent to 155,152, compared to a leap of 39 percent the week before, the RIVM said.The restrictions should “also work in controlling the further spread of the Omicron variant,” Timen said.Whether the Dutch will do so remains to be seen, in the view of one businessman who runs a Covid testing centre in the Amsterdam suburbs.Asking to be identified only as Jan, he says he does not ask his clients for a coronavirus pass and he shakes their hands “but cleans them afterwards.”His shop has stayed open during lockdowns, but he and his employees get tested every day.“I use my intellect,” says Jan, who has not been jabbed and will not allow his children to get Covid shots, although he is not against vaccination in principle.“I don’t automatically conclude that following the rules is the right answer.”"

Our planning isn’t finished yet, so I can’t say when we will be going, but it will be soon,” UN chief inspector Aake Sellstroem said.His team, which went to Syria last month, concluded in a report presented on September 16 that banned chemical weapons were used on a wide scale in the Syrian civil war.There was clear evidence sarin gas killed hundreds of people in an attack on Ghouta near Damascus on August 21, the report said.“The report that was presented was an interim report,” Sellstroem said.“There have been other accusations presented to the UN secretary general, dating back to March, against both sides” in the conflict, he said.There were 13 or 14 accusations that “have to be investigated”, he added.A UN-mandated independent commission of inquiry into rights violations in the Syrian conflict said Monday it was investigating 14 alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syria.Sellstroem’s team went to Damascus on August 18 to investigate claims that chemical weapons were used at Khan al-Asal, near Aleppo, on March 19 and at two other sites.The experts were in Damascus when the attack on opposition-held Ghouta was staged on August 21. The team was immediately ordered to concentrate on the Ghouta attack, and was expected to return later to investigate the other sites.The report by the UN chemical weapons experts did not say who used the sarin gas, though the Syrian opposition and its allies have blamed President Bashar al-Assad’s troops.Sellstroem said that in the next trip, inspectors would not be addressing the question of who was responsible for the August 21 gas attack, in which the United States claims more than 1,400 people died.“That’s not our assignment,” he said.The attack sparked threats by the United States and other Western nations of a military strike on Assad’s forces.But the military threat has eased after Russia and the United States agreed on a plan to put Syrian chemical arms under international control.Syrian officials have denied using sarin gas and Russia said Wednesday Damascus had given it evidence that the rebels were behind the August 21 attack.Sellstroem said the weapons inspectors’ travel plans should “firm up within a week”.He said he hoped to be able to present a final report addressing all of the accusations “possibly by the end of October”."

7765456133,https://www.breitbart.com/news/un-climate-talks-a-lost-opportunity-says-guterres/,"UN climate talks a ‘lost opportunity’, says Guterres","Madrid (AFP) – A major climate summit wrapped up in Madrid Sunday with a compromise deal that left little to show, prompting UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to lament a “lost opportunity” to act.Almost a fortnight of COP25 talks just squeezed out hard-earned compromises from countries over a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis.“I am disappointed with the results of COP25,” Guterres said. “The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis.”The summit’s final declaration “expresses the urgent need” for new carbon cutting commitments to close the gap between current emissions and the Paris treaty goal of capping temperature at below two degrees, host country Spain said.“Today, the citizens of the world are asking for us to move ahead faster and better,” Carolina Schmidt, Chilean environment minister and President of COP25, told the closing plenary.But Tina Eonemto Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, denounced the response as inadequate for facing an existential threat of rising sea levels.“Unfortunately, the new text we adopted this morning does not reflect anything near what we would have wanted. It is the bare minimum and we regret that countries could not agree on a more ambitious text,” Stege said.Green youth activist Greta Thunberg — named 2019 Person of the Year by Time magazine — on Friday slammed world leaders for “still trying to run away from their responsibilities” while demanding a “year of action” in 2020.Following a year of deadly extreme weather and weekly protests by millions of young people, Madrid negotiators were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to double down.The summit — moved at the last minute from Chile due to unrest — at times teetered on the brink of collapse as rich polluters, emerging powerhouses and climate-vulnerable nations groped for common ground in the face of competing national interests.“Based on the adopted text, there is a glimmer of hope that the heart of the Paris Agreement is still beating,” Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift, said.“But its pulse is very weak.”Negotiators from nearly 200 nations came to Spain’s capital with the aim of finalising the rulebook for the 2015 Paris accord, which enjoins nations to limit global temperature to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit).– ‘Missing in action’ –With the accord set to become operational next year, it had been hoped COP 25 would show the world that governments would be moved by protests, irrefutable science, and deadly storms and wildfires that marked 2019 to redouble their efforts.But greater ambition — how far each country is willing to slash carbon emissions or assist less wealthy peers to do likewise — has largely failed to materialise, leaving some veteran observers aghast.“Never have I seen such a disconnect between what the science requires and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists and a 28-year veteran of the climate process.“Most of the world’s biggest emitting countries are missing in action and resisting calls to raise their ambition.”The push for  strengthening  voluntary carbon cutting plans is led by small-island and least-developed states, along with the European Union.These have called out nations they see as blocking consensus — notably the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia.China and India, the world’s No. 1 and No. 4 carbon emitters, made it clear they see no need to improve on their current emissions reduction plans, which run to 2030.These emerging giants chose instead to emphasise the historical responsibility of rich nations to lead the way and provide financing to poor countries.“Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations,” said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and, as France’s top negotiator, a main architect of the Paris Agreement.“But thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters.”– ‘Loss and damage’ –The summit was also meant to finalise a chapter on carbon markets in the Paris rulebook.Instead, the focus now switches to next year’s COP 26 in Glasgow, when the true Paris deadline falls.The US, which is leaving the Paris deal next year, was accused of playing spoiler on a number of issues.This included so-called “loss and damage” funding to help disaster-hit countries repair and rebuild.“The US has not come here in good faith,” said Harjeet Singh, climate lead with charity ActionAid.“They continue to block the world’s efforts to help people whose lives have been turned upside down by climate change.”Even if all countries implement their current plans under Paris, Earth is on course to warm more than 3C by 2100."

The censorship board would consist of nine members, four of whom would represent the minority Republican party.The billstates:Such assessment shall include, but need not be limited to,(1) short term and long term effects of harassing behaviors online on elected officials, public officials and residents of this state,(2) what state or municipal action is needed to address negative online behaviors that consider a citizen’s right to freedom of speech versus an individual’s right to be free from harassment including, but not limited to, potential changes in state law concerning  additional penalties or enforcement of online harassment, and(3) establishing guidelines for the reporting of online harassment of elected state and municipal officials that find a balance between making elected officials accessible to the people whom they serve and protecting them from abusive, offensive or threatening online harassment.Chris Zeller, executive director of the Connecticut Republican party (CTGOP), told Breitbart News the Democrats are trying to pass a censorship measure to cover up their agenda.“They are trying to hide years of incompetent governance and a far-left agenda that is too radical for the average Connecticut voter,” he said.According to a policy brief fromYankee Institute, about 150 people commented on the legislation via (presumably written) testimony. The vast majority of these opposed the bill. Some of those who opposed the bill said it would be used to “inhibit freedom of speech.”Kate Prokop, president of Connecticut Residents Against Medical Mandates (CTRAMM),statedin her testimony that she is worried her organization will be censored because certain Democrat state politicians labeled CTRAMM as “extremist” during the pandemic.“I’m not advocating for hate speech or condemning people. [I’m] against online censorship because it establishes an unnecessary paternal relationship with the government,” Prokop said. “Proposed Bill 6410 aims to limit constitutionally protected free speech online by demanding self-censorship from residents that have been gaslighted by elected officials for years.”The bill was approved by committee March 17 and will now get a vote in the House.The censorship board is being proposed despite the fact that the state of Connecticut already has a law protecting elected officials and the public from online harassment. The name of that law, which renders cyberstalking and cyber-harassment unlawful, isPublic Act No. 21-56.RELATED VIDEO–HEATED EXCHANGE: Thomas Massie Schools Democrat on Social Media CensorshipVideo Source: HouseRules / YouTubeFollow Wendell Husebø onTwitter@WendellHusebø.

The Padres have won five of six road series this season.Darvish (4-1) struck out five, walked none, allowed six hits and continued a run of solid starts. But it was the veteran right-hander’s work in the sixth inning that helped the Padres win the series.“I asked him how he felt after the sixth and he said he felt fantastic,” Padres interim manager Ryan Christenson said.With good reason.Darvish allowed one-out singles to Rhys Hoskins and Alec Bohm that put runners on the corners with the Padres ahead 2-0. Schwarber, batting .189, struck out swinging. Castellanos, the cleanup hitter, grounded into an inning-ending forceout.“I wish I would have got the job done there,” Schwarber said. “That’s the thing that will sit with you. You’ve got to put the ball in play. You don’t know what can happen from there.”Bryce Harper lobbied hard for the Phillies to sign Schwarber and they gave the outfielder a $79 million, four-year contract. Castellanos got a $100 million, five-year contract. That’s $179 million on two sluggers that have gone cold as Harper sits out with a sore elbow. The Phillies were shut out for the fifth time this season.Harper missed a fourth straight game from the lingering effects of platelet-rich plasma injection in his right elbow. The Phillies hope Harper can return Friday against the Los Angeles Dodgers.“It’s a presence that’s missed,” Schwarber said. “But it’s a team. We all want Bryce in the lineup. He’s a staple MVP. We want him in the lineup. When he’s not in the lineup, we need to be able to pick that up.”The Padres have won each of Darvish’s last six starts since April 17 and he’s 4-0 over that span.“He had all of his pitches working. He was in the zone,” Christenson said. “It was just a great game by him.”Luis Garcia got two outs in the eighth. The Padres move to bring in lefty Taylor Rogers to face the left-handed Schwarber backfired when he lined a single up the middle. But Rogers got Castellanos to ground into another forceout to end the inning. Rogers worked the ninth for his 15th save.Every Padres starter had a hit.The Padres and Phillies each won 3-0 games in the first two games of the series and this one also had little offense. Robinson Cano lined an RBI single to right — and nearly took out teammate and baserunner Wil Myers — off Kyle Gibson (3-2) and Ha-Seong Kim added a sacrifice fly for a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning.Gibson struck out seven, walked none and gave up eight hits in 5 2/3 innings.“We’ve had guys with struggles for a substantial period of time,” Phillies manager Joe Girardi said. “Everybody’s struggled a little bit. But eventually numbers get back to what’s on the back of a baseball card. These guys have some good times coming.”TRAINER’S ROOMHarper hasn’t played right field since April 16 and will remain as DH whenever he returns. He took light swings each of the last two days. OF Mickey Moniak (broken wrist) started a rehab assignment in extended spring training in Clearwater, Florida. SS Didi Gregorius (left knee sprain) has no timeline for a return.TIP OF THE CAPHarper seemed to find a hat in the stands a fan was wearing that he liked more than his own Phillies cap. Harper tossed his maroon Phillies hat into the stands and the fan threw his back to Harper for the trade. The fan who claimed he got the hat tweeted it wasautographed by Harper.DOG DAYSAs concession stand prices soar in all sports, the Phillies scheduled only two $1 hot dogs promotions this season. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania got the message from fans the team needed more cheap meat and tweeted, “I agree,more Dollar Dog Nights. @Phillies, let’s do this.”Aramark, the Phillies’ food service provider, said at least one more discounted dog day would be added.“The Phillies and Aramark work together on the dates. We are planning for another dollar dog night, and we will be announcing that in the near future,” the company said in an email.ON THE MENDThe Padres still don’t know when manager Bob Melvin will return followingprostate surgerylast week. Melvin had another exam scheduled for Thursday where could he receive the OK to return to the dugout this weekend.“I haven’t felt a lot of stress in the dugout,” Christenson said.UP NEXTThe Padres wrap their road trip with three in San Francisco. The Padres send LHP Sean Manaea (2-3, 3.77 ERA) to the mound Friday against Giants RHP Jakob Junis (1-1, 1.74).The Phillies host the Dodgers for three and send LHP Ranger Suarez (4-1, 3.72) to the mound Friday against LHP Julio Urias (2-3, 3.00).___More AP MLB:https://apnews.com/hub/MLBandhttps://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

The bill is designed to keep agencies open until later in December while bargainers address disputes over spending levels and other issues like immigration that have become part of Congress’ year-end work.Signaling problems, the House Rules Committee postponed a planned meeting from Tuesday until Wednesday to work out debating rules for the budget measure. A House GOP leadership aide says the full House now plans to debate the legislation Thursday.Federal funding runs out at midnight Friday unless it is replenished by Congress.___11:50 a.m.A key House Republican leader acknowledges that some tax cuts in the sweeping tax legislation must expire to comply with Senate budget rules.The tax bill passed by Senate Republicans would let tax cuts for individuals expire in 2026, while the package passed by the House would make them permanent. Lawmakers are now working to reconcile the two bills.Texas Rep. Kevin Brady says, “We can’t achieve permanency in everything.”Republican senators say they made the tax cuts temporary to comply with Senate budget rules that prevented Democrats from blocking the bill. Under the rules, the Senate cannot pass legislation that adds to long-term budget deficits.Brady chairs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee and says House Republicans are still deciding which taxes they would sunset.___10:05 a.m.House Republican leaders are sticking to their plan for a short-term extension to keep the government open despite opposition from the hard-right Freedom Caucus.Congress faces a Friday midnight deadline to fund government agencies or face a partial shutdown. Rep. Pete Sessions, chairman of the House Rules Committee, told reporters Tuesday that the House is moving ahead on a two-week extension to Dec. 22. This would give Republicans and Democrats time to negotiation some of the last-minute agenda items such as spending totals, money for children’s health care and disaster relief.Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus want an extension until Dec. 30, fearing that the short-term date would give Democrats move leverage in negotiations.The Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress are scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump on Thursday.__3:20 a.m.President Donald Trump and congressional leaders have scheduled a summit to begin sorting out their budget differences. That’s from top lawmakers and the White House.And a clash that could produce a partial government shutdown by the weekend hangs in the balance.The meeting, set for Thursday at the White House, comes just a day before federal spending expires that’s needed to keep agencies functioning beyond midnight Friday night."

Many Western athletes and organizations criticized WADA for letting Russia provide data after the deadline.An earlier WADA delegation left Moscow empty-handed in December after Russian officials alleged its equipment wasn’t certified under Russian law.WADA is seeking data covering several years up to 2015, when the laboratory was shut down on its orders. WADA investigations found lab staff routinely covered up failed drug tests by hundreds of leading Russian athletes across dozens of sports.That eventually led to Russia being punished with restrictions at last year’s Winter Olympics, where it fielded a smaller-than-usual team under the title “Olympic Athletes from Russia” and a neutral flag.A vehicle bearing the insignia of the Investigative Committee, a Russian law enforcement agency, arrived at the lab earlier Thursday.The Investigative Committee has sealed off data and samples at the lab as part of its own doping investigation.

He pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud.In addition to the jail time, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ordered Huneeus to pay a $100,000 fine and serve 500 hours of community service.Prosecutors said he paid $100,000 to the scheme’s ringleader, William “Rick” Singer, to doctor his daughter’s SAT score. Huneeus also was prepared to bribe the University of Southern California’s athletic department to admit his daughter as a water polo player even though she didn’t play the sport.Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin O’Connell said in a court filing that of all the parents implicated in the scandal, Huneeus’ efforts were “calculated and carefully planned” and he involved his daughter in carrying out the scheme.“From the outset … Huneeus wanted to know exactly how the fraud worked, proposed ways to make it more effective, and demanded Singer’s attention. He did all this while acknowledging to Singer that what they were doing was wrong, that the scheme could ‘blow up in [his] face,’” O’Connell wrote.Huneeus requested a two-month sentence, saying he’s already paid enough for his crime because he lost his company, while prosecutors asked for 15 months. He stepped down as CEO of Huneeus Vintners in May.Fifteen people, including Singer, have pleaded guilty to charges related to the Operation Varsity Blues scandal.On Thursday, Talwani sentenced Manhattan lawyer Gordon Caplan to one month in prison, and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Last month, actor Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison and 250 hours of community service in addition to being ordered to pay a $30,000 fine for paying $15,000 to fix her daughter’s test scores. Los Angeles businessman Devin Sloane, 53, was sentenced to four months in prison, in addition, completing 500 hours of community service over two years and paying a $95,000 fine for paying $250,000 to get his son into the University of Southern California as a fake water polo recruit."

1611344558,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA877QA80,Fort Hood suspect kicked gun from officer's hand,"(AP) Fort Hood suspect kicked gun from officer’s handBy MICHAEL GRACZYK and NOMAAN MERCHANTAssociated PressFORT HOOD, TexasWith the gunman standing over her, Fort Hood police officer Kimberly Munley tried to fire her weapon as she lay bleeding on the ground. Nothing happened.The shooter then kicked the gun from her hand. But then the shooter’s gun malfunctioned and he stumbled back as one of Munley’s fellow officers yelled, “Drop your weapon.” The officer fired, and the gunman fell.Munley recalled those seconds while testifying Friday at the military trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people that day at the Texas military base in November 2009. The Army psychiatrist also is accused of wounding more than 30 others in the worst mass shooting ever on the U.S. military base.When asked if the man who tried to kill her was in the courtroom, Munley _ who was shot three times _ pointed to Hasan.Munley told jurors that she quickly spotted someone in Army clothing with a gun after arriving at the scene, a medical building on the Army post that had been crowded with soldiers preparing to deploy. She then heard her colleague, Sgt. Mark Todd, order the man to drop his weapon.Munley said she saw a red laser flash across her eyes, and she began taking fire. She said the gunman was running and firing in her direction, so she took cover behind a building.“I realized he was not slowing down whatsoever,” she testified. “He rounded the corner and within eight feet or so, we blindly began to exchange fire.”She was shot once in her right hand and twice in her right leg.“When I fell to the ground, the shooter was closer to me,” she testified. “I tried to continue to fire. My weapon would not fire. Some sort of malfunction in my weapon. I see him standing over me trying to shoot me.”She said Hasan then “kicked the weapon out of my hand.” She said she crawled to regain her gun as Hasan was trying to fix his weapon when she heard Todd again order the gunman to drop his weapon. Todd then fired his gun, Munley said.“I see him go down,” she said of Hasan. She explained that she then scooted herself up a wall to “try to put pressure on what I know is an arterial wound.”Hasan _ who is acting as his own attorney _ raised no objections and declined to ask any questions during Munley’s testimony, which has largely been his strategy since the trial began last week. His lack of defense so far has allowed prosecutors to call more than 70 witnesses, indicating that the trial could wrap up far sooner than the months-long timeline originally announced by the judge.The military attorneys who have been ordered to help him during the trial have accused Hasan of trying to convince jurors to convict him and sentence him to death, though Hasan denies those claims.If convicted by the jury, composed of all military officers, he could face the death penalty."

He is expected to tour the Western Wall, Muslim and Christian holy sites, and occupied Palestinian territories.The prince’s trip was announced in March and welcomed by Israeli and Palestinian officials.British royals have historically declined invitations for official state visits to Israel. William’s marks the first time a member of Britain’s royal family visited Israel as an official representative of the London government.British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said the visit is an “important and unique opportunity to promote diplomatic and cultural ties in the region.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “a historic visit” and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he hopes it will “contribute to strengthening ties of friendship between the two peoples.”Although Britain and Israel are considered allies, Prince William’s visit comes at a time of some disagreement. Britain was critical of the United States moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem last month, and British Prime Minister Theresa May called for Israeli restraint after dozens of Palestinian protesters were shot to death at the Gaza-Israel border earlier this year.Israel was supportive of President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which Britain has pledged to uphold.On Sunday, William and Jordanian Crown Prince Hussein watched a World Cup soccer match together and later visited the archaeological ruins of Jerash, a Roman city dating to the first century.The site has a personal connection to the royal couple. Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, was photographed there by father Michael Middleton in 1984, when she was a child. Her family moved to Jordan when she was two years old after her father was relocated by his employer, British Airways.The Duke of Cambridge and The Crown Prince arrive at the spectacular Jerash archaeological site, a first century Roman city, and one of Jordan’s greatest tourist attractions. pic.twitter.com/kZzwXrebQk- Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) June 25, 2018"
4775056099,http://www.breitbart.com/news/north-dakota-rig-count-unchanged/,North Dakota rig count unchanged,"BISMARCK, N.D., April 25 (UPI) — The number of rigs in service in North Dakota, the No. 2 oil producer in the United States, held steady despite last week’s rally in oil prices, data show.State data show 29 rigs actively exploring or producing oil and natural gas in the state, unchanged from the previous week, but steady at the lowest level in roughly a decade. In a mid-April report on state operations, Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, said that pressure from lower crude oil prices meant companies working in the state were “committed to running the minimum number of rigs.”Rig counts serve as a loose barometer for the health of the energy sector. North Dakota’s rig count for Monday is 65 percent lower than this date in 2015 and 86 percent lower than the level in 2012. The all-time low point is zero.For the fifth week in a row, oil services company Baker Hughes reported a decline in rig activity in North America, with a 2 percent drop to 431. Last year’s count for the week ending April 22 was 932.Lower oil prices means less capital is available for energy companies to invest in exploration and production activity. Crude oil prices, however, are up 22 percent from the start of April as market investors take stock of expected declines in total U.S. oil production and rumors of a production freeze among some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.Oil production in North Dakota as of February, the last full month for which the state has data, was 1.1 million barrels per day, down about 0.3 percent from January and nearly 9 percent below the all-time high recorded in December 2014.Economists have said the supply-side pressures that pushed oil prices sharply lower last year are starting to fade, though few expect prices to recover to $100 any time soon.Helms said he expected the pressure from lower crude oil prices could last until the middle of next year."

7047369908,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2011/03/07/the-muslim-brotherhood-in-america-deputy-national-security-advisor-mcdonough-meets-with-hamas-support-entity/,The Muslim Brotherhood in America:  Deputy National Security Advisor McDonough Meets with Hamas Support Entity,"It is being reported that on Sunday, March 6th, Denis McDonough, the Deputy National Security Advisor to the President of the United States attended the ADAMS Interfaith/Government Summit in Sterling, Virginia.The implications of this are frightening and shocking – and may be criminal.ADAMS (All Dulles Area Muslim Society) is led by its Executive Director, Mohammad Majid.   Majid is also the President of the largest Muslim Brotherhood / Hamas support entity in North America – the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA).A significant amount of evidence has been entered into federal terrorism trials revealing ISNA is not only the largest Muslim Brotherhood entity in North America, but  is a cover and support organization for Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement).   Hamas is designated as a “Foreign Terrorist Organization” (FTO) by the United States Government.Specifically, Muslim Brotherhood (MB) documents were entered into evidence at the largest successfully prosecuted terrorism financing and Hamas trial in U.S. history (US v Holy Land Foundation, Dallas, 2008 – hereafter “HLF”).   One of the documents, “An Explanatory Memorandum,” was written in 1991 by a top Hamas official living in the United States (Mohamed Akram), and was discovered in 2004 during an FBI raid where the archives of the Muslim Brotherhood in the U.S. were discovered at the Annandale, Virginia home of another leading Hamas official and Muslim Brother (Ismail Elbarasse).   This is the strategic document for the Muslim Brotherhood in North America, and was approved by the MB’s Shura Council and Organizational Conference.   It is an official MB document which was entered into evidence during the HLF trial and stipulated to by the defense that it was what it purports to be – the MB’s strategy document for North America.The document states the Brotherhood is waging a “Civilization-Jihadist process” which is a “kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.”The last page of this Memorandum is a list of “our organizations and the organizations of our friends” – it lists 29 of the Brotherhood front entities as of 1991.   This list constitutes the most prominent Muslim organizations in North America today – despite it being nearly 20 years old.   The list includes the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA).A Historical MB document also entered into evidence at HLF and stipulated to by the defense reveal ISNA was created to be a “nucleus” for the Islamic Movement in North America.At a 1993 meeting of Hamas officials in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which was covered by the FBI (surveillance/recorded conversations/photography), recorded meetings revealed the Hamas leaders discussed using ISNA as an official cover for their activities.Numerous financial documents were entered into evidence at HLF detailing ISNA’s direct support for Hamas over a period of years.   Because of the totality of the documentary, testimonial, financial, and other evidence at the US v HLF trial, ISNA was named an unindicted co-conspirator in that case.   “Unindicted co-conspirator” indicates the prosecution has enough evidence to prosecute, but has made a decision not to do so at this time.   It should be noted there are 246 Unindicted Co-conspirators in the HLF case.In 2007, ISNA, along with the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT) filed a memorandum to the Federal court in the Northern District of Texas asking to have their names removed from the unindicted co-conspirator list.   A memorandum filed by the prosecutors on 7/10/08 stated: “ISNA and NAIT, in fact, shared more with HLF than just a parent organization.   They were intimately connected with the HLF and itsassigned task of providing financialsupport to HAMAS(emphasis added).The judge did not remove ISNA from the unindicted co-conspirator list.Following further petitions to the court by ISNA, a 2009 ruling by U.S. Federal Judge Solis, unsealed in July 2010, stated as follows:“During the early years of OLF/HLF’s operation, OLF raised money and supported Hamas through a bank account that it held with ISNA and NAIT.   Indeed, OLF operated from within ISNA in Plainfield, Indiana where Defendant Baker was employed.ISNA checks deposited into the ISNA/NAIT account for OLF were often made payable to ‘the Palestinian Mujahadeen,’ the original name for the Hamas military wing.”(emphasis added)“The Government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of CAIR, ISNA, and NAIT with HLF, the Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP), and with Hamas.”(emphasis added)Judge Solis did not remove ISNA from the list of unindicted co-conspirators.Whether ISNA is or is not an “unindicted co-conspirator” in the HLF case is actually not as germane as is the massive amount of evidence clearly indicating:   (1) ISNA is the leading Muslim Brotherhood entity in the U.S. which seeks to overthrow our Constitutional government; (2) ISNA is a Hamas support entity; (3) no evidence exists, except the “word” of the leaders of ISNA, that ISNA has ceased doing what it was created to do.The remarks made by Deputy National Security Advisor McDonough on 3/6/11 at the ADAMS Center are on the White House website for all to read.   His comments began with:   “Thank you (Imam Majid), also, for being one of our nation’s leading voices for the values that make America so strong, especially religious freedom and tolerance.   Whether it’s here at the ADAMS Center, or as President of the Islamic Society of North America, you’ve spoken with passion and eloquence, not only about your own Islamic faith, but for the need to build bridges of understanding and trust between faiths.”So, Mr. McDonough knows Mohammad Majid is the leader of   ISNA.His remarks further included:   “Over the past two years, I–along with my White House colleagues–have benefited from the advice of many of your organizations through our Office of Public Engagement.   Because, after all, your communities have the same concerns as all Americans–the economy, education, health care, the safety of our children and our country.”Actually Mr. McDonough, the Muslim Brotherhood is only concerned with its objectives, which are the same as Al Qaeda’s – the re-establishment of the global Islamic State (Caliphate), under which Shariah (Islamic Law) is enforced.   The HLF related rulings and all the evidence are available to the public via the Northern District of Texas’ own website, so the information is readily accessible.Again, we must ask the same tired question – why are those charged with our national security, violating their Constitutional oaths to do so and taking actions which appear to support our enemies?"

You know, the problem is you just tell everybody she’s on crack.” And I said, “Brian, look, I know she’s on crack, but you can’t just say it that way, it’s not going to persuade anybody. And then he says, “I got a better idea to shut her up,” and that’s what I can’t tell you, you’ll just have to wait and hear it.-Now, The Family Guy, as everybody knows, is staffed pretty much by liberals.  So I walk in and the first guy that comes up to me whispers, “Hey, I’m your biggest fan here.  I’m the only one.  I’m a conservative and I’m really glad to see you, it’s a thrill to meet you…On the way out another guy comes up, “I’m the only conservative in the building and I just wanted to say hi, and I wanted to see you before you left.” And I said, “No, no, no, no, there’s another. There are actually two of you.” “There are?” I didn’t tell him who, I didn’t identify him, his secret is safe with me.-I thought this episode was going to start out this season, it would be the premiere episode this season.   It’s not.   It’s the premiere episode in September of 2010.-I want to thank Seth MacFarlane and his people for giving me the invitation and opportunity to appear on it and throwing such a great time yesterday.Read the full transcripthere."

The opposition said 11 people were killed.Moise has said nothing since Sunday’s protests.He was supposed to speak to the nation Tuesday in a televised address but it was dropped several hours after being announced, with no explanation given.“We had technical failures,” Emmanuel Jean-Francois, an advisor to the president, said Wednesday after being reached by telephone.“We are taking all measures to broadcast it this morning,” he added, declining to give a time or say what it would be about.National police spokesman Gary Desrosiers said the force was braced for the aftermath of the protests.“We remain on the ground to assure everyone’s protection,” he told AFP.In the upscale Petionville neighborhood, the only two gas stations opened were besieged by taxi-moto drivers desperate to refuel.The breakdown in presidential communications was widely criticized on social media, with many refusing to believe the delay was caused by technical problems, and others criticizing the incompetence of the presidential services.On Monday, the presidency released only a brief statement with a picture of Moise and Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant, surrounded by the chairs of both chambers of parliament and the president of the supreme court of appeals.The statement said the meeting had three objectives: “that the executive pursue dialogue with all sectors of national life, resolve problems linked to insecurity, and intensify programs of social relief.”Various opposition groups, arguing that the situation is out of control, have proposed ways to remove the president in order to resolve the crisis."

I don’t know enough about the technology to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.”Clinton did not specify what this would look like, instead speaking in general terms.

Earlier this year, when asked by journalists if she had attempted to “wipe” a private email server containing classified government emails,Clinton gave the infamous response “what, like, with a cloth or something?”The journalist then pressed her, saying “you know how it works, digitally,” to which Clinton responded “No, I don’t know how it works digitally at all.”Similarly to that incident, Clinton’s latest bout of technological illiteracy is politically convenient. Surveillance remains a dangerous topic for Presidential candidates.According to Pew, Democrat supporters divided on the issue of internet and phone surveillance,with 48 per cent opposed and 47 per cent in favour, while independents are opposed by a margin of 57 to 39. Being able to placate both sides, as Clinton did, is the optimal political approach.The only problem is that you can’t placate both sides, at least on the issue of encryption. What Clinton doesn’t know – or pretends not to know – is that you either have an encrypted system, or you have an encrypted system with back doors. There is no middle ground.But that’s politically inconvenient.FollowAllum Bokhari @LibertarianBlueon Twitter, and downloadMilo Alert!for Android to be kept up to date on his latest articles."

7026698104,https://www.breitbart.com/news/club-world-cup-the-answer-to-super-league-threat-says-infantino/,"Club World Cup ‘the answer’ to Super League threat, says Infantino","Zurich (AFP) – FIFA President Gianni Infantino has told AFP that his plans for a new, expanded Club World Cup provide the perfect antidote to any potential threat of a breakaway Super League by elite clubs.According to documents published in the latest series of Football Leaks allegations, a group of top European clubs has discussed the idea of establishing a closed competition which could replace the UEFA Champions League.The revelations came barely a week after Infantino agreed at a FIFA Council meeting in Rwanda to delay any decision over his plans for a Club World Cup and a global Nations League, instead setting up a taskforce to study the proposals.That was reportedly after UEFA delegates threatened to walk out in protest, and yet Infantino hopes his idea will still win out.“The Club World Cup is the answer to any breakaway temptation,” Infantino said in an interview with AFP and other media in Zurich.“It will bring much more money for clubs and for the solidarity (development projects).”Infantino has been pushing to revamp the Club World Cup by expanding it from the current seven clubs to 24 and holding it every four years. Twelve of the teams would be European.He has said he has an offer of $25 billion over 12 years for that and the Nations League from private investors, identified by Football Leaks as Japan’s Softbank.Defending his plans, the 48-year-old said: “These attempts to create a Super League are there since the 1990s, and this is coming every time, and it’s up to us, the government of football, to protect the whole pyramid football system, which benefits the clubs and the world football community.“If clubs organise a breakaway Super League, it will benefit only the clubs. If FIFA organises the Club World Cup, it will benefit the clubs and the 211 football associations.”– ‘Nothing illegal’ –Infantino, who also played down the prospect of the World Cup being expanded to 48 teams in time for the next tournament in Qatar in 2022, responded to further allegations from Football Leaks by saying he had done “nothing illegal”.Several media, including French investigative website Mediapart, published claims that Infantino — then UEFA’s Secretary General — “directly negotiated” an agreement with Manchester City after they were found to have breached Financial Fair Play rules in 2014.He was alleged to have bypassed UEFA’s Financial Control Panel in offering City a “fine of 20 million euros instead of 60.” Paris Saint-Germain then received the same treatment, Mediapart said.“The Financial Fair Play rules allow for the possibility of negotiations and agreements. And who is in charge of negotiations and discussions on the settlement agreements? The administration,” Infantino said.Mediapart also accused Infantino of not doing enough to clean up FIFA’s reputation since succeeding Sepp Blatter in charge of world football’s scandal-tainted governing body in 2016.“We came here in 2016 and we tried to change a few things. We knew from the beginning that it would not be easy to try to do things in an environment which was very, very rooted in some practices,” said the Swiss-Italian, who also claimed that his background was not to the liking of his critics.“The fact that you have the son of Italian immigrants being FIFA president is maybe not liked by many, and in addition he brings a lady from Africa (Fatma Samoura), a Muslim, in charge of the general secretariat.“From all these criticisms nothing was even remotely concerning anything illegal or contrary to some regulations, which is quite a big difference compared to the past in this organisation,” he added.Nevertheless, the Football Leaks revelations also shone a light on Infantino’s relationship with a Swiss prosecutor called Rinaldo Arnold, which will now be investigated by authorities in Switzerland.He allegedly invited Arnold to attend the World Cup in Russia, the 2016 FIFA Congress in Mexico and the Champions League final in Milan that year.“I think it’s unfair this attack. Let the justice make its course as they always say. I am very happy and proud to have Rinaldo as a friend,” said Infantino, who added that he was “confident” of being re-elected FIFA president next year."

UnlessClintonis jailed or dies of a coughing fit,Sanderswill not win the nomination.But that is not to say he will not stick around for a very long time.

In his campaign, he has “mansplained” forMrs. Clintonprecisely the message and tone Democratic voters want to hear.He has also revealed that the vaunted “Obama coalition” no longer exists. At least not at the moment.

And the longer that lasts, the less enthusiastic Democrats will be in November and the less likely the “Obama coalition” reunites for another, tired, oldClinton.Democrat turnout in Nevada caucuses Saturday was off 33 percent from 2008. Republican voters, meanwhile, keep breaking records for turnout with every primary contest.Doing her best to learn fromBernie Sanders,Hillary Clintongave another “Phew!” speech declaring a four-point victory in Nevada.Once again, she was wearing one of her Chairman Mao blouses — this one bright communist red. It looked almost Elizabethan — except ugly. The large, squarish collar appeared to be concealing her respirator.“I have never believed in dividing America between us and them,” she said.

After his unit surrendered to Soviet troops, Botyan joined the Red Army and became a Soviet citizen, the SVR said.After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Botyan joined the NKVD secret police and was trained to conduct intelligence operations behind enemy lines. In September 1943, he oversaw an operation in the Ukrainian town of Ovruch that killed some 80 Nazi officers.After the end of WWII Botyan worked as a secret agent on foreign missions, the SVR said.Russia this year will hold a massive military parade for the 75th anniversary of Soviet victory over the Nazis as tensions run high between Moscow and Warsaw.Putin recently accused Poland of being in cahoots with Hitler during World War II while not mentioning the secret Soviet-Nazi pact to invade and carve up Poland.Warsaw has criticised Moscow for “renewing Stalinist propaganda” and “wasting” reconciliation efforts to improve ties.burs-or-as/am/bsp"

Say it to my face,” tweeted a defiant Mahathir, who is seeking the top job again as the opposition’s candidate in looming polls, with a picture of himself at the discussion late Thursday.Mahathir, who was premier for 22 years, has returned to frontline politics after a 15-year break to take on scandal-plagued Prime Minister Najib Razak at the election due by August.But his old age has raised questions about his ability to rule if the opposition succeeds in toppling the long-ruling coalition. In the unlikely event Najib is unseated, Mahathir would become the world’s oldest prime minister.At Thursday’s forum, a three-man panel was talking about Mahathir when the man himself walked in midway, causing the speakers to fall silent them and many in the hall to rise to their feet.The panel — which consisted of a political pundit, psychology expert and fitness coach — stopped their discussions and opened the floor for Mahathir to speak.“There are two types of age. One in terms of years and another in terms of the body. The age of the body does not necessarily equate to the age in years,” he told the forum in Shah Alam, outside the capital Kuala Lumpur.“As far as health is concerned, I’m not senile yet.”The government has frequently attacked Mahathir over his age, with Najib comparing him to ousted Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, who is 94."

Paul Ryan during their debate in the fall campaign.Another was “forty-seven percent,” which recalled Gov. Mitt Romney’s self-destructive statement at a May fundraiser that voters who paid no federal income tax were more likely to vote for his opponent.The third phrase was “double down”–a phrase used in a variety of contexts, but one that NPR and the American Dialect Society’s Ben Zimmer chose to illustrate by citing former President Bill Clinton’s misleading statement that Romney would “double down on trickle-down” economics. (NPR and Zimmer left out Romney’s own innovation on the “trickle-down” theme, when he accused President Barack Obama of “trickle-down government.” It isnot a phrase Romney invented; neither did Biden invent “malarkey,” though he certainly provided many examples.)When they turn to politics, the mainstream media’s year-end lists seem invariably to illustrate the liberal bias that they persist in denying. CNN, for example, just released its list of the top five political fumbles of 2012–and four of them were committed by Republicans, though certainly Democrats provided lots of material as well.The mainstream media seems locked into the mindset that its purpose is not just to report facts and analyze trends but to do so in a way that assists a struggle against an imagined establishment of wealth and power that is personified by Republicans. They miss the fact that after eighty years of expanding government, and a highly successful campaign of infiltration and activism, the media havebecomethe cultural establishment.They are the enemy they seek, which is why more Americans are turning off, canceling, and tuning out."
6705058598,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/06/01/blue-state-blues-samantha-bee-metoo/,"Blue State Blues: Samantha Bee Abuses Woman, Wins #MeToo Award","In the rich history of Hollywood hypocrisy, there are few examples more striking than comedian Samantha Bee receiving an award for defending women from sexual harassment just one day after she called Ivanka Trump a “c*nt” and suggested she seduce her father to change his immigration policies.Bee apologized earlier in the day, but as sheacceptedherawardThursday from the Television Academy, she actually praised herself for her idealism.“We spent the day wrestling with the repercussions of one bad word,” Bee said, minimizing what she had actually said, “when we all should have spent the day incensed that as a nation we are wrenching children from their parents and treating people legally seeking asylum as criminals.”In other words, it is Bee’s critics who ought to feel shame.Bee apologized, but she is not really sorry for degrading a woman. She is proud, because it was for a higher cause.And Hollywood is proud of her, too, even though what Bee did to Ivanka Trump is exactly the sort of behavior that the #metoo movement is supposedly trying to stop.Bee denigrated and sexualized Ms. Trump, using her femininity as a way to humiliate and bully her. There are men in Hollywood who have been excommunicated over the past few months for doing that to female colleagues and employees, but Bee wastoldshe should have gone even further.All of this occurred literally hours after Roseanne Barr lost her show, and likely her career, for a racist remark that was made in jest and for which she apologized contritely, telling friends and fans not to defend what she had done.The double standard is clear: if you are on the left, you can get away with almost anything — and if you are on the right, you can be abused by everyone. The #metoo movement does not apply to conservative women: they are not, in fact, to be considered women.Palestinian-American Muslim radical Linda Sarsour, co-organizer of the anti-Trump Women’s March — which was behind the school walkouts for gun control earlier this year — said as much when shetweetedabout female critics of radical Islam several years ago: “I wish I could take their vaginas away – they don’t deserve to be women.” She referred to Ayaan Hirsi Ali — a woman forced to endure genital mutilation.Bee said at the Television Academy awards that she — and her staff, and her network, who presumably reviewed her monologue before she delivered it — had simply been carried away by righteous anger at “the inhumanities of this world,” including the policy of separating children from their parents when they enter the country illegally.But the policy was not started by Donald Trump, and it was introduced, in part, toprotectmigrant children from trafficking.Many on the left wereforced to eat crowthis week when it turned out that a photograph of supposedly inhumane treatment of these children had been taken in 2014, under Barack Obama.Never mind, they said — the policy is still wrong, and the government has “lost” nearly 1,500 of these children. Except that turns outnot to be true, either.And when conservatives raised concerns about migrant children in 2014, the left actuallydefendedtheir detention. Samantha Bee and the impassioned staff ofFull Frontal, and networks standing behind her — Time Warner and TBS — had nothing to say about the problem them.They are not overcome by righteous indignation. They are blinded by hatred — so much so that they cannot even see they are throwing away what they say they believe.They are no longer #metoo heroes, but fraudulent feminists rewarding each other for abusing the right kind of women.Their hypocrisy is outrageous, but it is also self-defeating. They have reminded millions of ordinary Americans, in a crucial midterm election year, why they voted for Donald Trump in the first place — namely, to push back against the elites in Hollywood and Washington who despise them.When Roseanne posted her racist tweet, conservatives hadno problem condemning her, even as they mourned the destruction of her show and the movement behind it. It was not only wrong, but politically stupid.For some reason, Hollywood cannot even acknowledge that applauding Samantha Bee is a massive tactical mistake that could motivate conservative voters to keep Congress in Republican hands and forestall the policy changes liberals say they want. That is how lost they are in their own nightmare.One would almost feel sympathy for them — if they weren’t doing their best to force everyone else to share their misery.Joel B.

The mandate applies to parents who have worked at least six months at companies with 50 employees or more, but will include companies with as few as 20 in 2018.California is one of the first states that offers a partially paid parental leave. But the new law in San Francisco requires full paid leave. An employee-financed disability insurance pays for about half the leave and employers pay for the other half.The Chamber of Commerce seemed stuck between the needs of parents and the needs of small-business owners, many of whom opposed the new law.The chamber declared itself neutral on the issue, but noted there was a “strong belief among many business owners that once again, to the financial detriment of small businesses, a mandate is being adopted in San Francisco that would be better dealt with at the state or federal level.”The United States is the only developed country that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave at a federal level, despite experts extolling the health benefits for parent and child.The new law comes just a day after California governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 over the course of several years."

Many gamblers backed the New England Patriots, who beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 on Sunday night and covered the spread of 2 1/2 points.Nevada, which had an effective monopoly on sports betting until the Supreme Court ruled last year that states could allow it, is expected to report its Super Bowl betting totals later Monday.Joe Asher is chief executive of William Hill US, which runs sportsbooks at two casinos and a racetrack in New Jersey. He says Super Bowl Sunday was by far the company’s biggest day ever in the state in terms of the amount wagered. He says the book broke even and also had a record day for mobile signups and betting.DraftKings, which runs mobile wagering in New Jersey along with an in-person lounge at Resorts casino, also set a new record for handle.

1285676672,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA68I1D00,US government files morning-after pill appeal,"(AP) US government files morning-after pill appealBy COLLEEN LONGAssociated PressNEW YORKThe Obama administration on Monday filed a last-minute appeal to delay the sale of the morning-after contraceptive pill to girls of any age without a prescription.The legal paperwork asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan to postpone a federal judge’s ruling that eliminated age limits on the pill while the government appeals that overall decision.U.S. District Court Judge Edward Korman has said that politics was behind efforts by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to block the unrestricted sale of the Plan B One-Step morning-after pill and its generic competitors.Last month, he ordered that the levonorgestrel-based emergency contraceptives be made available without a prescription and without point-of-sale or age restrictions. He then denied a request to postpone his ruling while the government appealed, but gave them until Monday to appeal again.Government attorneys warned that “substantial market confusion” could result if Korman’s ruling was enforced while appeals are pending. On Monday, lawyers argued that the district court “plainly overstepped its authority,” and that they believe they will win the overall appeal.Attorneys for the Center for Reproductive Rights have said in court papers that every day the ruling is not enforced is “life-altering” to some women. They have 10 days to respond to the most recent government filings, after which the appeals court will issue a decision.If the government fails, it would clear the way for over-the-counter sales of the morning-after pill to younger girls. The FDA announced earlier this month that the contraception could be sold without a prescription to those 15 and older, a decision Korman said merely sugarcoated the appeal of his order lifting the age restriction.Sales had previously been limited to those who were at least 17.The judge said he ruled against the government “because the secretary’s action was politically motivated, scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent” and because there was no basis to deny the request to make the drugs widely available."

Rashida Tlaib (MI) was caught maskless on a crowded dance floor at a wedding party Sunday where she danced and hugged guests.Singer Bassam Saleh posted a string of videos to his Instagram stories featuring a Sunday wedding at the Ford Community and Performing Arts Center in Dearborn, Michigan.The videos featured pictures and videos of Tlaib, including one on the dance floor surrounded by people, holding hands with others and dancing, and hugging another guest. She and others are not wearing masks at the wedding party, which takes place indoors.That same night of the wedding, Tlaib railed against Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), tweeting that “people are getting sick and dying” from coronavirus in Kentucky. “He needs to put politics aside, and put people first. Start resisting the virus,” shetweeted:Meanwhile, a slew of businesses in Dearborn have startedimplementingmask mandates regardless of vaccination status, according to Patch.com. And the University of Michigan on Mondayannouncedthat it would require masks to be worn at all times indoors at its campuses, including in Dearborn, beginning Wednesday, regardless of vaccination status, citing rising coronavirus cases.The day before the wedding, Tlaib posted photos to her official Twitter account showing her wearing a mask and meeting with union workers also wearing masks at a factory in Detroit.The photos and videos of Tlaib at the wedding party emerged just a day after photos and videos circulated online from former President Barack Obama’s 60th birthday bash Saturday, which alsoshowedhim on the dance floor with guests and taking photos with them maskless. That party, however, took place outdoors in a giant tent.D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) was also caught maskless indoors at a wedding party two Saturdays ago, on the very same day she ordered an indoor mask mandate to begin. A spokesperson claimed she was not wearing a mask because she was eating and drinking, although photos obtained by theWashington Examiner‘s Tiana Lowe did not show her doing either. TheWashington Post‘s Fact Checker Glenn Kessler gave Bowserfour Pinocchiosfor that excuse.These maskless photos of Democrats also come after the Biden Office of Budget and Management (OMB)directedall federal workers, and contractors and visitors to federal facilities in areas with “substantial or high” transmission of the Coronavirus to wear a mask.Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong onTwitteror onFacebook."
5461152035,http://www.breitbart.com/news/intel-panel-to-examine-possible-campaign-links-with-russia/,Intel panel to examine possible campaign links with Russia,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Intelligence Committee will investigate possible contacts between Russia and the people associated with U.S. political campaigns as part of a broader investigation into Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.In a statement late Friday, Sens. Richard Burr. R-N.C., the committee’s chairman, and Mark Warner, D-Va., the panel’s top Democrat, said the panel “will follow the intelligence where it leads.”Burr and Warner said that as part of the investigation they will interview senior officials from the Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration. They said subpoenas would be issued “if necessary to compel testimony.”“We will conduct this inquiry expeditiously, and we will get it right,” the senators said.A declassified intelligence report released last week said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence the election to favor President-elect Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton, revelations that have roiled Washington.Trump and his supporters have staunchly resisted the findings and Trump has leveled a series of broadsides at U.S. intelligence agencies, even though he’ll have to rely on their expertise to help him make major national security decisions once he takes over at the White House next week. He will be sworn in Jan. 20.At a news conference this week, Trump speculated that U.S. intelligence agencies might have leaked details about a classified briefing with him that included unsubstantiated allegations that Russia had collected compromising sexual and financial information about him.He said any such information was not true: “It’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen.”The bulk of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s work will be done in secret, although the senators said they will hold open hearings when possible.“As the committee’s investigation progresses, we will keep Senate leadership, and the broader body, apprised of our findings,” Burr and Warner said.Democrats and some Republicans have pressed for a special, select bipartisan committee to conduct the investigation, but Republican leaders have maintained that the existing committees are capable of handling the inquiries.According to the committee’s statement, the inquiry will include:— A review of the intelligence that informed the declassified report about Russia’s interference in the election.— “Counterintelligence concerns” related to Russia and the election, “including any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns.”— Russian cyber activity and other “active measures” against the United States during the election and more broadly.___Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner"

8944339112,https://www.breitbart.com/news/us-catholic-clergy-shortage-eased-by-recruits-from-africa/,US Catholic clergy shortage eased by recruits from Africa,"The U.S. Roman Catholic church faces a clergy shortageUS Catholic clergy shortage eased by recruits from AfricaBy KWASI GYAMFI ASIEDUAssociated PressThe Associated PressWEDOWEE, AlabamaWEDOWEE, Alabama (AP) — The Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo — using skills honed in his African homeland to minister effectively in rural Alabama— determines just how long he can stretch out his Sunday homilies based on who is sitting in the pews.Seven minutes is the sweet spot for the mostly white and retired parishioners who attend the English-language Mass at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the small town of Wedowee. “If you go beyond that, you lose the attention of the people,” he said.For the Spanish-language Mass an hour later, the Nigerian-born priest — one of numerous African clergy serving in the U.S. — knows he can quadruple his teaching time. “The more you preach, the better for them,” he said.As he moves from one American post to the next, Abanulo has learned how to tailor his ministry to the culture of the communities he is serving while infusing some of the spirit of his homeland into the universal rhythms of the Mass.“Nigerian people are relaxed when they come to church,” Abanulo said. “They love to sing, they love to dance. The liturgy can last for two hours. They don’t worry about that.”During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church. As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies.The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica. Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served.“They have been an enormous help to us to be able to provide the breadth and scope of ministry that we have available to us,” he said.Africa is the Catholic church’s fastest-growing region. There, the seminaries are “fairly full,” said the Rev. Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church.It’s different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals.Catholic women and married men remain barred from the priesthood; arguments that lifting those bans would ease the priest shortage have not gained traction with the faith’s top leadership.“What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country,” Gaunt said. “Those who entered back in the ‘50s and ’60s are now elderly and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality.”From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center. This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor.Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama. His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line. After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish.“He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories,” said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988.For Moosman, Abanulo’s preaching style is very different from the priests she’s witnessed previously. “There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that…It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict,” she said. “It’s a lot different now.”Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate pastor in the diocese of Oakland, California, where his ministry focused on the fast-growing Nigerian Catholic community. Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama.Amid the U.S. clergy shortage, religious sisters have experienced the sharpest declines, dropping 75% since 1970, according to the Georgetown center.When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, “Where is West Virginia?”She was scared, worrying about the unknowns.“What kind of people am I going to? I’m just a Black nun coming to a white country,” Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004.Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and “rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank…She thought I was dirty.” Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming. She’s now a U.S. citizen and says, “It feels like home.”One of her first culture shocks was an overnight snowfall. “I really screamed. I thought it was the end of the world,” she said. “Now I love it. I do my meditations to that.”During their integration into American life, it is commonplace for newly arrived clergy to face culture shocks.For Sister Christiana Onyewuche of Nigeria, a hospital chaplain in Boston administering last rites for the dying, it was cremation. She recalled thinking, “Like really? …How can they burn somebody? I can’t even imagine.”She came to the U.S. 18 years ago and previously served as the president of African Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, a support group for African missionaries serving in the U.S.Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve. To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations.Abanulo, who moved to Alabama in 2020, admits he was initially apprehensive about his latest posting, which meant exchanging a comfortable role as university chaplain for two rural parishes.“People were telling me ‘Father, don’t go there. The people there are rednecks,’” he said.But after a year, and a warm reception, he says he now tells his friends, “There are no rednecks here. All I see are Jesus necks.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through The Conversation U.S. The AP is solely responsible for this content."

6108552038,http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2017/08/30/suspension-bengals-lb-burfict-reduced-three-games/,Suspension for Bengals LB Burfict Reduced to 3 Games,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict had his NFL suspension reduced from five to three games Wednesday for his egregious hit on a Chiefs running back during a preseason game.During the second preseason game, Burfict leveled running back Anthony Sherman on a pass play when he wasn’t the intended target. The play wasn’t penalized, but the league can impose fines or suspensions after reviewing plays.Burfict originally got a five-game suspension but challenged it. Appeals officer James Thrash reduced it to three games on Wednesday. Burfict will miss home games against the Ravens and Texans and a road game with the Packers. He’ll be eligible to return for a game in Cleveland on Oct. 1.It’s the second straight season he’s suspended for the first three games. He was punished last season for his hit to Antonio Brown’s head during a 2015 playoff loss to the Steelers. That punishment was due in part to his history of egregious hits.Burfict’s hit on Brown moved the Steelers in range for a last-minute field goal and an 18-16 victory in the opening round of the playoffs. The meltdown left the Bengals without a playoff victory since 1990, the sixth-longest streak of futility in NFL history.In a letter to Burfict notifying him of the latest three-game penalty, the league noted his pattern of hits on defenseless players, including one on Ravens tight end Maxx Williams that drew a $50,000 fine.“This is not your first offense with respect to illegal hits to defenseless players,” wrote Jon Runyan, the league’s vice president of football operations. “To the contrary, this incident is consistent with your pattern of egregious safety-related violations, including your hit on a defenseless player during the 2015 wild-card game and your hit against a Baltimore tight end away from the play on Jan. 3, 2016.“When players violate the rules intended to protect player safety on a repeated basis, and particularly when the violations carry with them a significant risk of injury to an opposing player … you must be held accountable for this continuing unacceptable conduct.”The Bengals have staunchly defended Burfict. They supported his appeal of the suspension, contending his hit on Sherman wasn’t a technical violation of the league’s player safety rules. In response, the league cited its rules banning unnecessary contact against defenseless players and those who aren’t involved in the flow of the play.Sherman was coming out of the backfield on a throw down the field to a different player when Burfict lowered his shoulder and leveled him.In defending Burfict on Tuesday, coach Marvin Lewis said the linebacker has changed. Lewis cited several other plays in the same preseason game when Burfict followed the rules.“On the very next play, the quarterback scrambles, Vontaze runs over and jumps over Alex Smith when he slides,” Lewis said. “The very next play after that, the back goes to the flat and he’s going down for a first down.

According toYoung Americans for Freedom, student Grant Strobl created a series of posters regarding the liberal media’s attack on conservative women. The slogan of the posters: “Respect Women!” The posters themselves featured conservative women attacked by the left, including Michelle Malkin, Laura Ingraham, Sarah Palin, and S.E. Cupp — and they even featured Sandra Fluke, and talked about how certain rhetoric was inappropriate. Here they are:Oddly enough, the posters were not allowed on the walls of the school by the administration. Here’s one of the posters thatwasallowed:As Strobl writes:March, as many of us know, is Women’s History month, and my school, Grosse Pointe North High School, has not done anything to honor the month. So, I decided to create a series of posters with a message of respecting all women regardless of their beliefs particularly highlighting conservative women. I showcased Vinciane Ngomsi who was spat on by the husband of one of her professors for her conservative activism, Sarah Palin who was challenged by the media as to whether her special needs child was hers, Laura Ingraham who was called a “Sl**”, among others. I pointed out the obvious injustices done against women by the media. Like my many other projects, this one was challenged by the administration at my school.My posters were not allowed to be hung on the walls yet the words,”Black Power” next to Martin Luther King’s image did end up on the walls and wasn’t challenged. This is not only an injustice to women but to MLK as well.Apparently, it’s too controversial for school to talk about nasty rhetoric about women, but it’s just fine to link Martin Luther King, Jr. with “black power,” a slogan popularized by Black Panther Honorary Prime Minister Stokely Carmichael. No wonder our public schools are churning out liberals at records rates."

Remember that circus? Four Republican pro-amnesty “moderates” — Lindsay Graham, John McCain, Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake —joined four Democrats to sponsor a very ambitious amnesty bill. That bill passed the Senate but with a majority of Republican senators voting “no,”and it was so bad and doomed to failure it was never even introduced in the House.Well, it looks like that failed Gang-of-Eight game plan is being resurrected for the 2017 campaign to sell a deceptive general amnesty bill as the “replacement” for Obama’s DACA program. One of the four Democrats who sponsored the Gang-of-Eight bill, Robert Menendez, is now on trial for corruption, so he had to be replaced. On the Republican side, John McCain and Marco Rubio have been replaced by Cory Gardner and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski —a “RINO” Republican who recently showed her true loyalties by joining McCain in voting to kill the Senate Republican health care bill.It looks like her appetite for sabotage has not yet been satisfied.So, we now have four pro-amnesty Republican “moderates” –Graham, Flake, Murkowski and Gardner–joining Gang-of-Eight Democrats Charles Schumer, Richard Durbin, and Michael Bennet to cosponsor S.1615, the“Dream Act of 2017,” which is sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee.Folks, that senate amnesty bill resembles the DACA program about as much as Germany’s Hindenburg resembled Charles Lindberg’s Spirit of St. Louis flight. They were both “aircraft,” but had nothing else in common.Respected conservative columnist Byron York this past weekpointed outthe numerous differences between the DACA program and the glaring amnesty provisions of the “Dream Act of 2017.”The DACA program does not grant a path to citizenship, bars to criminal aliens,and does not throw open the floodgates for chain migration under the rubric of “family reunification.”Yes, the new Schumer-Flake amnesty bill will give legal status to the 780,000 “Dreamers” who have been protected from deportation by the DACA program, but it does far more than that. The Schumer-Flake billalso establishes a generous amnesty program which will give a green card and apath to citizenship to over 5,000,000 migrants once its “family unity” and “humanitarian” loopholes are fully implemented.This is “bait and switch” legislation at its worst.News bulletin for the amnesty lobby: 2017 isnot 2013: There’s a new sheriff in town.In 2013, when the Gang-of-Eight amnesty bill passed the Senate, both the Senate and the White House were under Democrat control. Today, both are under Republican control. So, why are Republicans allowing pro-amnesty Democrats Durbin and Schumer to set the terms of the DACA debate? Is it because the Republican leadership of the Senate agrees with the open border principles of the US Chamber of Commerce and not the Rule of Law principles of Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump and the US Constitution?OK, let’s admit that the new sheriff in town, our independent-minded President, is not popular among Republicans or Democrats in the Washington establishment.In fact, there is a danger that a shared hatred of the Trump presidency might be enough to bring Republican and Democrat leaders together in support of a new amnesty bill.However, since it is widely believed that Trump will sign any DACA-related bill put on his desk, passing an amnesty bill loathed by both the Republican grassroots and Trump loyalists might be too high a price to pay among most Republicans for the fun of poking the President in the eye.But wait. Is it Donald Trump’s and Jeff Sessions’ principles that being challenged by the blatant amnesty provisions of the “Dream Act of 2017” — or is it the Republican Party’s principles? Let’s do something seldom done in swampland: let’s look at the 2016Republican Party Platform.” There we find this statement in the section on Immigration and the Rule of Law:We stand with the victims of [Obama’s] policies, especially the families of murdered innocents. Illegal immigration endangers everyone, exploits the taxpayers, and insults all who aspire to enter America legally. We oppose any form of amnesty for those who, by breaking the law, have disadvantaged those who have obeyed. . . .The executive amnesties of 2012 and 2014 are a direct violation of federal law and usurp the powers of Congress as outlined in Article I of the Constitution. These unlawful amnesties must be immediately rescinded by a Republican president.Why are so many congressional Republicans expressing anger and angst at the President and Attorney General for keeping a Trump campaign promise and conscientiously implementing the principles and promises made to the voters in the official 2016GOP Platform?Amazing, isn’t it, how quickly so many Republican lawmakers forget the principles that got them elected in the first place?Is there a Republican alternative to jumping on board another amnesty bill and generating a massive revolt by grassroots Republicans and Trump’s own loyalists? Yes, and the alternative is so simple even the RNC staff can understand it.Republicans can legislate legal status for the 780,000 DACA beneficiaries who have qualified under the 2012 conditions set forth in the 2012 administrative rules —and no one else–not the individuals who did not apply before September 5, 2017, not individuals who came here on their own and were not brought by their parents, not the petty criminals and additional millions of arrivals since 2007 who would qualify under the new rules and timetables in S.1615. In short, Republicans can write a bill that draws a line in the sand and welcomes the “DACA kids” but does not open the floodgates for a new wave of illegal entries.Oh, and as the price for this generosity, Republicans can follow the suggestion of Senator Tom Cotton and add mandatory E-Verify for all employers to the bill.Do that and the “DACA mess” is fixed without a general amnesty for millions. Of course, there are Republicans in Congress who answer not to promises and principles that got them elected but to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and donors like the Koch Brothers.Those Republicans can choose money over principles, amnesty over the rule of law, andthen suffer the consequences — a Republican shipwreck in 2018."

They would go to night school to learn English,” Kunis told the magazine. “My mom started working at Thrifty in Culver City as a box lady. That’s what she did until she learned English; then she became a cashier.”“My dad worked—f*ck if I know—seven jobs? He painted a house. He would deliver toilets. He drove a cab, delivered pizzas. Whatever he could do, he did,” the actress added. “Ultimately, my dad owned cabs, and my mom worked her way up to manager of a Rite-Aid; they bought a car and a condo. But growing up poor, I never missed out on anything. My parents did a beautiful job of not making me feel like I was lesser than any other kids.”Kunis says it is this family history that leads her to vehemently disagree with Trump’s proposed immigration policies.“The whole Syrian refugee thing—we came here on a religious-refugee visa, and I’m not going to blow this country up,” she toldGlamour. “I’m clearly paying taxes. I’m not taking anything away. So the fact that people look at what’s happening and are like, ‘Pfft, they’re going to blow sh*t up?’ It saddens me how much fear we’ve instilled in ourselves.”Kunis also dismissed Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.“I don’t even have to answer that one,” she said. “There’s no point. It’s a really great sound bite. And it got him far.

Russia has previously exploited diplomatic ties with the rogue Islamic regime of Iran to expand its military reach in Syria, taking credit for victories benefitting dictator Bashar al-Assad largely attributable to the Iranian military.In China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Putin may find a similarly willing actor to elevate the prestige of the comparably less intimidating Russian military.The Chinese state outlet Xinhuareportedthat CPC Central Military Commission vice chairman Zhang Youxia visited Putin on Thursday to discuss deepening military cooperation. Xinhua states that Putin told reporters that he feels “the two countries should continue to strengthen their partnership in joint military drills, army games and personnel training.”Putin reportedly went on to emphasize the need for China and Russia to work together military to “maintain regional and global peace and stability as they hold the same or similar positions in many issues.”Xinhua quotes Zhang as saying that “China is ready to work with Russia to implement the consensuses between the two presidents, support each other, and jointly safeguard security interests of both countries and help maintain world peace and stability.”In addition to meeting with Putin, Zhang met with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, who according to the Russian outlet TASSechoedhis boss’s interest in deepening an alliance with the PLA.“Highly confidential relations between the Russian and Chinese state leaders play a very important role in bilateral ties,” Shoigu is quoted as saying. “Russian President Vladimir Putin participated as the main guest in the Belt and Road Forum that was held in Beijing in May, in July China’s President Xi Jinping visited Russia, and in November the leaders held substantial talks on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Da Nang.”“Belt and Road,” or “One Belt One Road,” is a sprawling Chinese economic project designed to give Beijing full control of trade routes between Beijing and Europe through the construction of roads, ports, and critical infrastructure ultimately ending up in Chinese control.In addition to high-level meetings, the Russian and Chinese militariesbeganjoint exercises on Thursday in northwest China. A Russian military press release states that the exercises service to help Russian Special Forces adapt to “a dry climate without precipitations … and to the meals represented by a variety of both traditional spicy and sour-sweet Chinese and European dishes.”China and Russia both have a vested interest in maintaining stability in the region, most loudly threatened by the Kim Jong-un communist regime of North Korea. Pyongyang consistently threatens to use nuclear weapons against the United States and test-fires its missiles over Japan, not constituting an immediate threat to either China or Russia, but both nations have insisted on taking on a larger role in discussions with North Korea.On Tuesday, for example, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulovinsistedthat Moscow should play a larger role in any dialogue with Pyongyang regarding its nuclear program.“We have channels, through which we are conducting a dialogue, and we are ready to deploy them, we are ready to exert our influence on North Korea,” Morgulov said. “We believe that the isolation alone … will not work, this won’t take us forward. By doing this, we will only worsen the situation, which is dangerous. We are really on the brink of a real war.”The same day, however, a report in Japanese media cited sources within North Korea who had evidence to believe that “massive amounts” of Russian oil were flooding the North Korean economy, keeping it afloat in the midst of global sanctions. China, meanwhile, has increased its trade flow to North Korea, but upheld United Nations sanctions on goods such as seafood and coal.In October, American President Donald Trump suggested that Russia was a hindrance to dialogue with North Korea.“China is helping us and maybe Russia’s going through the other way and hurting what we’re getting,” TrumptoldFox Business host Lou Dobbs.Follow Frances Martel onFacebookandTwitter."

He said their claims that Israel is changing the delicate arrangement at the site, holy to both Muslims and Jews, are “emphatically untrue.”Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Friday he is freezing ties with Israel until the devices are removed.Oren said Abbas’ declaration may serve a political need but it “cuts off the limb on which he sits.”___10 a.m.Israel’s military says it has sent more troops to the West Bank after a Palestinian infiltrated a settlement and stabbed three Israelis to death in their home.The decision came Saturday after military officials met overnight following the attack.It did not elaborate but said it was in addition to hundreds of soldiers in place Friday over tensions at a major Jerusalem shrine.Israel’s Chief of Staff and Defense Minister are expected later in Halamish, the West Bank settlement where Friday night’s attack took place.The Palestinian killed three members of the same Israeli family as they ate the traditional Sabbath meal.The attack came after three Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured in protests over metal detectors Israel set at the entrance to the shrine following a deadly Palestinian attack there.___9:15 a.m.A relative says Israeli troops have arrested the brother of a 20-year-old Palestinian who stabbed to death three members of an Israeli family.The assailant, identified as Omar al-Abed had sneaked over the fence of the Israeli settlement of Halamish in the West Bank late Friday and infiltrated the family’s home, surprising them during a Sabbath dinner.The army says the attacker killed a man and two of his children, while a woman was wounded.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) as he endorsed him on stage—and Cruz got the oath wrong when he took it.“What is the oath of office that you have to take?” Beck asked Cruz after the Texas Senator joined him on stage after Beck’s more-than-half-hour-long speech endorsing Cruz.“What—what?” Cruz replied.“Dear God, if you don’t know this, everything else—“ Beck joked. “When you raise your right hand, what are you going to say?”“I pledge to honor and defend the Constitution of the United States of America,” Cruz replied.Technically speaking, that’s not the oath of office for the president of the United States.The oath of office for the president of the United States is actually spelled out quite clearly in the U.S. Constitution,specifically Article II, Section 1, Clause 8. That part of the Constitution reads in full: “Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—’I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.’”That means Cruz saying the oath of office he’d take is—“I pledge to honor and defend the Constitution of the United States of America”—is not correct.The oath of office Cruz would take if elected President is: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”"

John Kasich coming in second with 15 percent. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tied for third place with 11 percent each, while Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., came in fourth with 9 percent.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie garnered 7 percent of the vote, coming in fifth place. HP CEO Carly Fiorina won 4 percent and Dr. Ben Carson won 2 percent. All the way at the bottom, barely registering a blip was former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore with less than a percent of the vote.Among Democrats, Sanders beat out Clinton by 15 percent, winning 13 delegates to Clinton’s seven. The Washington Post reported Clinton conceded the state to Sanders shortly after polls closed.RealClear Politics showed Trump polling on average well ahead of the rest of the Republican field at 31 percent going into the primary.As for Sanders, he averaged at 54 percent, 13 points ahead of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.After beating the Vermont senator by an extremely narrow margin in Iowa last week, Clinton’s camp braced for a loss in New Hampshire. However, CNN reported that congressional Democrats are preparing to oppose Sanders in the coming weeks as the fight moves to South Carolina.No other Republican candidate polled within 15 points of Trump. On average, Rubio polled at 14 percent. Despite his third place win in the Iowa caucuses, the Florida Senator took some hits in New Hampshire after getting pummeled on the debate stage last weekend.After New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knocked Rubio for delivering repetitive remarks, the senator’s events have been dogged by protesters dressed as robots holding signs with slogans like “Marco Roboto” and “Rubio Talking Points 3000.” Many of the so-called “Rubiobots” have been sent by progressive groups.Tuesday morning, Rubio supporters and campaign staff were even involved in a physical altercation with the “Rubiobots.” A liberal group called Americans United for Change captured the scuffle on video and posted it to YouTube.Kasich came close to tying Rubio with a polling average of 13 percent. Kasich, along with Sanders, won the primary contest in Dixville Notch, the first New Hamsphire town to go to the polls.Cruz, who averaged at 11 percent, won the Iowa caucuses largely due to his aggressive campaign work with the state’s Evangelical voter base. However, where Iowa Republican voters are more than half Evangelical, exit polls showed they only comprised a quarter of Republican voters in this year’s primary.Bush tied with Cruz in the Granite State, and may be gearing up for a comeback following a dismal showing in Iowa.Christie is polling at 5 percent, on average, after snubbing Iowa on caucus night and honing in on New Hampshire voters. Bush and Kasich did the same.Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina comes in at 4 percent — and after failing to make the cut for the last GOP debate Saturday, New Hampshire may be make-or-break territory for Fiorina — who did manage to win one delegate in Iowa.Christie and Fiorina are not expected to make the cut for the next GOP debate this weekend. Much like the last ABC News debate, this Saturday’s CBS News debate will not feature an undercard debate."

That committee, chaired by Marc Conner, associate provost, consists of students (both law and undergraduate) and members of the faculty, staff and administration. We created UCICC in 2008 as “an institutional platform to address issues of inclusiveness and diversity, in response to concerns within the campus community.” Throughout this year, UCICC and the Office of Student Affairs have been holding focus groups with students to discuss some of the very issues that the law students are raising.Ruscio also pointed out that he “impaneled a special committee… last year… to explore the history of African Americans at Washington and Lee.”He concluded “by reiterating that the students have raised important questions that relate to ongoing discussions at the University.” He said he welcomes “their contributions and those of all members of the University community” and is “certain” their concerns can be addressed “in a manner that is both respectful and productive.”Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter@AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart.com."

And second, the formulation that Huckabee had, which was that Obama was marching the Israelis to the door of the oven had the implication, it wasn’t intended, but it could be interpreted as that Obama’s doing it deliberately. you can argue he doesn’t understand the gravity, etc. So, I think in that sense, that those are not the words he should have used. Nonetheless, the idea that somehow there’s something utterly impermissible about invoking the Holocaust in this case because it’s some kind of wild analogy, this is a reality. The Iranians are obsessed with the Holocaust. A few years ago, they had a cartoon contest to ridicule the Holocaust, because they contend it never occurred. And yet, the former president, the moderate…has described Israel as a one-bomb country, meaning small, compact, small population, can be wiped out with a small nuclear weapon. Iran has made very clear its intent to wipe Israel off the map. And now it’s in the process of acquiring the means of doing that. And I think it’s extremely important to recognize the uniqueness of this deal, because Israel, all the neighbors of Iran are scared and afraid of the deal, and worried about it. But, Israel’s the only country on earth openly threatened with annihilation. No other country on earth is. So, this is a real possibility, it’s not as if the Iranians are not going to drop the bomb tomorrow. But, Israelis would have to live under that threat forever if this deal is enacted, and Iran acquires the bomb.”Will stated that Huckabee, “should not have said the part, as Charles says, about the president leading Jews to the door of the oven. That said, Huckabee is right that rhetoric should be taken seriously. Sometimes, especially when it is the particular candor of the dictator. In 1939, as Europe fell into war, Hitler said in the Reichstag that if the Jews perpetrate a world war it will mean the destruction of the European Jewry, and it did. So, taking this rhetoric seriously matters. And for those of us, and I count myself as one of these, who say, look, the deal is a terrible deal, but Iran’s going to get a nuclear weapon…we better start thinking how to deter them, one of the problems is gauging the fanaticism of the anti-Semitism of their regime. Because, as Hitler demonstrated, he would sacrifice everything, including pushing back the Russians on the eastern front, to continue with the Holocaust.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter@IanHanchett"

1310955639,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA6F5T3O1,Obama: America at 'crossroads' in terror fight,"(AP) Obama: America at ‘crossroads’ in terror fightBy JULIE PACE and LARA JAKESAssociated PressWASHINGTONDeclaring America at a “crossroads” in the fight against terrorism, President Barack Obama on Thursday revealed clearer guidelines for the use of deadly drone strikes, including more control by the U.S. military, while leaving key details of the controversial program secret.The president also announced a renewed push to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, including lifting a moratorium on prisoner transfers to Yemen. However, shutting the prison will still require help from Republicans reluctant to back Obama’s call to move some detainees to U.S. prisons and try them in civilian courts.Obama framed his address as an attempt to redefine the nature and scope of terror threats facing the U.S., noting the weakening of al-Qaida and the impending end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.“Neither I, nor any president, can promise the total defeat of terror,” Obama said in remarks at the National Defense University. “What we can do _ what we must do _ is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.”Since taking office, Obama’s counterterrorism strategy has increasingly relied on the use of strikes by unmanned spy drones, particularly in Pakistan and Yemen. The highly secretive program has faced criticism from congressional lawmakers who have questioned its scope and legality.The president, in his most expansive public discussion on drones, defended their targeted killings as both effective and legal. He acknowledged the civilian deaths that sometimes result _ a consequence that has angered many of the countries where the U.S. seeks to combat extremism _ and said he grapples with that trade-off.“For me, and those in my chain of command, these deaths will haunt us as long as we live,” he said. Before any strike, he said, “there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured _ the highest standard we can set.”Ahead of the address, Obama signed new “presidential policy guidelines” aimed at illustrating more clearly to Congress and the public the standards the U.S. applies before carrying out drone attacks. Officials said the guidelines include not using strikes when the targeted people can be captured, either by the U.S. or a foreign government, relying on drones only when the target poses an “imminent” threat and establishing a preference for giving the military control of the drone program.However, the CIA is still expected to maintain control of the drone program in Yemen, as well as in Pakistan’s tribal areas, given the concern that al-Qaida may return in greater numbers as U.S. troops draw down in Afghanistan. The military and the CIA currently work side by side in Yemen, with the CIA flying its drones over the northern region out of a covert base in Saudi Arabia, and the military flying its unmanned aerial vehicles from Djibouti."

[Emphasis added]U.S.-based companies Accuride Corporation of Evansville, Indiana and Maxion Wheels Akron LLC of Akron, Ohio initiated the trade case by appealing to the Commerce Department, accusing China of dumping steel wheels in the U.S. at extremely low prices.The investigation by the Commerce Department will determine if steel wheel imports from China are being dumped in the U.S. at prices that American businesses are unable to compete with.In 2017, alone, U.S. imports of certain steel wheels from China were valued at an estimated $388 million, according to the Commerce Department.The Trump administration’s action against China is only the latest effort to defend American companies and products against unfair competition from free trade with the foreign superpower.Most recently,Breitbart Newsreported how Trump announced $50 billion worth of tariffs and restrictions on imported Chinese goods.The move includes 1,300 categories of products, including certain medical products, televisions, dishwashers, and automobile parts and chemicals. These would be subject to a 25 percent levy.Since 2001, free trade with China hascost millionsof Americans their jobs. For example, in areportby the Economic Policy Institute, between 2001 and 2015, about 3.4 million U.S. jobs were lost due to the country’s trade deficit with China.Of the 3.4 million U.S. jobs lost in that time period, about 2.6 million were lost in the crippled manufacturing industry, making up about three-fourths of the loss of jobs from the U.S.-Chinese trade deficit.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

7067487459,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/03/24/second-judge-backs-trump-immigration-authority/,Judge Rejects Islamists’ Claim of ‘Discrimination’ in Donald Trump’s Immigration Executive Order,"A federal judge has slapped down a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s popular immigration reforms that was brought by radical Islamic activists, marking a political defeat for the diversity alliance which opposes Trump’s update of immigration priorities.“The core substantive issue of law, as to which Plaintiffs must establish a clear likelihood of success, is whether [Trump’s Executive order] falls within the bounds of the President’s statutory authority or whether the President has exercised that authority in violation of constitutional restraints,” said the Alexandria, Virginia-based judge, Anthony Trenga.“[T]he substantive revisions reflected in EO-2 have reduced the probative value of the President’s statements to the point that it is no longer likely that Plaintiffs can succeed on their claim that the predominate purpose of EO-2 is to discriminate against Muslims based on their religion and that EO-2 is a pretext or a sham for that purpose,” said Trenga, who sits on theU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.The decision makes no practical legal difference because thepopular policiesare already being blocked by progressive judges in Hawaii, Maryland and California. These judges are using a variety ofunprecedented legal argumentsto claim that judges have a new constitutional authority to set immigration policy, regardless of the laws which have given that power to the elected president and the Congress-funded national security, border and intelligence agencies.This is Trump’s second courtroom win on the issue, following a favorable decision made by a Boston judge on February 3.However, the March 24 legal victory is also a political win for Trump as he tries to update U.S. immigration rules to counter the threat posed by a diverse alliance of Islamic political groups, progressive open-borders factions and business groups seeking additional cheap labor and welfare-funded consumers.The lawsuit was brought by Linda Sarsour, a radical Islamic anti-Israel activist in New York. She appearsto support Islam’s totalitarian sharia law, and she displays great hostility to critics of Islam’s ideology. She can still appeal the case to theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, but it isalready preparing to rule on a similar case decided by a Maryland judge.The other plaintiffs include several Islamic advocates and Nihad Awad, the director of a radical Islamist group, theCouncil for American-Islamic Relations.Breitbart has frequently noted that the CAIR group is so closely entwined with Islamists andwith jihadisthat court documents and news reports show that at least five of its people — either board members, employees, or former employees — have beenjailedorrepatriatedforvariousfinancial andterror-relatedoffenses.CAIR has been declareda terrorist organizationby the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as anunindicted co-conspiratorin a Hamas-funding operation.Breitbart has also publishedevidence highlighted by critics showingthatCAIRwas named anunindicted co-conspiratorin a Texas-based criminal effort to deliver $12 million to the Jew-hating HAMAS jihad group, that CAIR was founded with$490,000 from HAMAS, and that the FBI bans top-level meetings with CAIR officials. “TheFBI policyrestricting a formal relationship with CAIR remains … [but] does not preclude communication regarding investigative activity or allegations of civil rights violations,” said an October 2015 email from FBI spokesman Christopher Allen.The Islamists’ lawsuit illustrates the leading role being played by Islamic political groups in the campaign against Trump’s popular Executive Orders, which are intended to exclude individuals with “hostile attitudes” towards American law and culture. For example, Trump’s first January 27  Executive Order declared:In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.That first Executive Order, signed January 27 and numberedE.O. 13769, was titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.” After the hostile judgments, Trump withdrew the order and issued a second order, which was the target of the Sarsour lawsuit.Trump’s language is very different from the language used by former President Barack Obama, who frequently derided Americans for getting “attached to our particular tribe.”The “hostile attitudes” language is legally muffled in the second version of the document, the March 6E.O. 13780, which is also titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.”Nonetheless, State Department officials areadopting new practicesthat reflect the president’s focus on protecting the nation’s peace and culture.The legal authority for Trump’s Executive Orders is found in Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, gives the President near-complete power over who gets into the United States, according to aJanuary 2017 reportby Congress’ Congressional Research Service. The critical language declares, at 8 U.S.C. § 1182 (f), that:Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate Section 214(a)(1) of the same law says that the “admission of any alien to the United States as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as [the Executive] may by regulations prescribe.”The President’s authority over immigration is bolstered by Supreme Court decisions. For example, the court declared in its 1950 judgment, titledKnauff v. Shaughnessy, that “It is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by [congressional] law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a given alien.”In 2015, the Court reasserted that judgment, saying inKerry v. Din, that:Din attempts to bring suit on [her Afghan husband’s] behalf, alleging that the Government’s denial of her husband’s visa application violated her constitutional rights… In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse. There is no such constitutional right.Already, the law and the Supreme Court’s rulings prompted a judge in Boston, Mass., toreject another lawsuitthe Massachusetts’ government against Trump’s E.O. “Therefore, in light of the ‘plenary congressional power to makepolicies and rules forexclusion of aliens,’ …whichpursuant to8U.S.C. § 1182(f), has been delegated to thePresident, the Court concludes that the [federal] government’s reasons, as providedinthe EO, are facially legitimate and bona fide,” the judge declared February 3."

Her death was confirmed by Jane Macon, a director of Siebert Financial and a partner at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.Siebert was founder and president of brokerage firm that bears her name, Muriel Siebert & Co. Inc. The company went public in 1996 as Siebert Financial Corp.Macon said Siebert was “a fabulous woman, a trailblazer and a pioneer” who set a high standard for those who entered the financial world after her. “She always pushed the doors open and kept them open for other people to follow.”Siebert, who was born in Cleveland and moved to New York in 1954 at age 26, started her career as a trainee in research at Bache & Co. earning a $65 a week. She went on to become an industry specialist in airlines and aerospace and later became a partner at brokerages including Brimberg & Co.She bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in December 1967 after months of struggling with the male-dominated business world that initially resisted her efforts to join. She established her investment firm the same year and transformed it into a discount brokerage house in 1975.Siebert took a leave of absence from the company in 1977 and placed it in a blind trust to be run by the employees when she was appointed the first woman superintendent of banking for the State of New York by Gov. Hugh Carey. She served five years.As interest rates climbed steeply and bank failures became common, Siebert launched protective measures to prevent banks from failing in New York. She reorganized troubled banks, forced bank mergers, and convinced the federal government to advance millions of dollars to make the new mergers viable. She persuaded stronger institutions to help weaker ones.In 1982, Siebert resigned from the job to run for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat of Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She came in second to a state lawmaker, Florence Sullivan, who went on to lose to Moynihan in the November election.Siebert returned to running her company.To celebrate 30 years as member of the exchange, Siebert was invited to ring the closing bell on the NYSE. The ceremony was held on Jan. 5, 1998.The next year, while president of the New York Women’s Agenda _ a coalition of over 100 women’s organizations _ Siebert developed a personal finance program to improve the financial literacy of young people.The program became part of the New York City high schools economics curriculum for seniors. Siebert worked to expand the program nationally.An advocate for women in business, she served on several organizations including the Council on Foreign Relations, the International Women’s Forum, Deloitte & Touche’s Council for the Advancement and Retention of Women, and the New York Women’s Forum, for which she was a founder and president.“Mickie was a pioneer and recognized as a leader throughout the financial services industry and beyond,” Siebert Financial Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ramos said in a prepared statement. “Those of us who worked with her will miss her spirit, leadership and great commitment to her clients and the securities markets.”Siebert also is a former appointee to the New York State Commission on Judicial Nomination and the National Women’s Business Council.Siebert, who lived in New York City, never married and did not have any children."

Although firearms officers have had leave cancelled for special events before, such as the Olympics, this is the first time such precautions have been taken for New Year’s Eve.In total, a record 6,000 officers will be on duty across the capital as revellers flock to popular spots including Trafalgar Square, and the banks of the Thames to watch the annual firework display. They do so under the shadow of an ongoing threat from Islamic State, who last month carried out an attack in Paris in which 130 people were killed.Earlier this week, police in Vienna alerted a number of European cities to apossible terror threatbetween Christmas and the New Year, following an anonymous tip off from a “friendly” intelligence agency.A list of possible offenders was included in the tip off, but specific locations have not been disclosed.Capital cities across Europe have reacted by tightening security measures, while some have even cancelled aspects of the festivities.InBrussels, the mayor has taken the extraordinary step of cancelling the city’s annual fireworks display due to the extremist threat.Parishas also cancelled its fireworks display, replacing it with a ten minute light show projected on the Arc de Triumph.And in Moscow, the Kremlin hasclosed off Red Square, the traditional focus of revelries, fearing terrorist actions.The Russian politician Irina Khakamada accused the Kremlin of handing the Islamic State a propaganda victory by doing so, saying: “In many major cities of the world, they still ensure security in city squares on New Year’s night. But we, as we are challenging terrorists, should not deprive people of the holiday.”London’s Mayor and senior police officers, by contrast, have encouraged Londoners to get out and enjoy themselves despite the threat, assuring the public that the police are being vigilant.Ken Marsh of the Metropolitan Police Federation, the leader of rank-and-file police in the capital said: “All firearms officers will be on duty. There is no leave for firearms teams to provide greater cover,” he said.“There is an awful lot of work going on behind the scenes.“I think people will defy the terrorist threat.“Londoners are very resilient and have a lot of faith in their police officers to keep them safe.”British business groups have also urged the public to defy the terrorist threat and carry on as usual, highlighting the role that corporations play in maintaining security.A spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry said: “Ensuring the safety of employees and customers is a priority for firms.“Businesses, especially large consumer-facing ones, have established security and resilience plans in place.“They will be working closely with the police to ensure people have a safe and enjoyable New Year.”Police forces outside of London are also calling in extra officers for duty in the face of the terrorist threat, while the Fire and Ambulance services have urged the public to do their part by planning ahead and looking out for one another.Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London is taking a defiant stand against would-be terrorists, calling on Londoners to demonstrate the resilient spirit of the city. “It’s business as usual,” he said.“From our fantastic fireworks on the banks of the Thames to thousands of events in pubs, clubs and restaurants across the city I’d urge Londoners and visitors alike to get out there and soak up the best we have to offer.“As with any other major event in the capital our policing response will be appropriate, but I’d stress we’ve seen nothing to suggest a specific threat to London.“I’ve no doubt people will be out there enjoying themselves in their hundreds of thousands. And so they should be.”Follow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter:Follow @Donna_R_Eor e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com"

8898073363,https://www.breitbart.com/news/some-fear-china-could-win-from-us-spat-with-marshall-islands/,Some fear China could win from US spat with Marshall Islands,"For decades, the tiny Marshall Islands has been a stalwart American allySome fear China could win from US spat with Marshall IslandsBy MATTHEW LEE and NICK PERRYAssociated PressThe Associated PressWELLINGTON, New ZealandWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — For decades, the tiny Marshall Islands has been a stalwart American ally. Its location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean has made it a key strategic outpost for the U.S. military.But that loyalty is being tested amid a dispute with Washington over the terms of its “Compact of Free Association” agreement, which expires soon. The U.S. is refusing to engage the Marshallese on claims for environmental and health damage caused by dozens of nuclear tests it carried out in the 1940s and ’50s, including a huge thermonuclear blast on Bikini Atoll.The dispute has some U.S. lawmakers worried that China might be willing to step into the breach, adding to a bruising competition for geopolitical dominance between the two superpowers.Since World War II, the U.S. has treated the Marshall Islands, along with Micronesia and Palau, much like territories. On the Marshall Islands, the U.S. has developed military, intelligence and aerospace facilities in a region where China is particularly active.In turn, U.S. money and jobs have benefited the Marshall Islands’ economy. And many Marshallese have taken advantage of their ability to live and work in the U.S., moving in the thousands to Arkansas, Hawaii and Oklahoma.But this month, 10 Democratic and Republican members of the House of Representatives wrote to President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, about the U.S. compact talks with the Marshalls, Micronesia and Palau.“It is distressing that these negotiations do not appear to be a priority — there have been no formal meetings since this Administration began — even as our international focus continues shifting to the Indo-Pacific,” they wrote.The lawmakers said the delays were putting the U.S. in a weaker position, and “China is all too ready to step in and provide the desperately needed infrastructure and climate resiliency investment that is sought by these long-time partners.”China’s Foreign Ministry said the U.S. should face up to its responsibility to restore the environmental damage it caused with its nuclear tests. It said China was willing to engage with the Marshall Islands and other Pacific island nations on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation under the “One China Principle,” in which Taiwan is viewed as part of China.“We welcome efforts to boost economic relations and improve the quality of life between the sides,” the ministry said in a statement.China has steadily poached allies from Taiwan in the Pacific, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands in 2019. Just this week, angry protesters in the Solomonsset fire to buildingsand looted stores in unrest that some have linked to the China switch.James Matayoshi, the mayor of Rongelap Atoll on the Marshall Islands, said he and hundreds of others have remained displaced from their atoll since the nuclear tests and want to see it revitalized. He said officials have been talking with potential investors from Asia, after a previous proposal by a Chinese-Marshallese businessman fell through.“It would be a business transaction. We don’t advocate for war or any superpower influence,” Matayoshi said. “But we want to be able to live in our backyard, and enjoy life here.”Like many others on the Marshall Islands, Matayoshi believes a U.S. settlement of $150 million agreed to in the 1980s fell well short of addressing the nuclear legacy. He said his late mother was pregnant at the time of one massive nuclear blast and got exposed to radiation that was the equivalent of 25,000 X-rays before giving birth to a stillborn baby.But the U.S. position has remained static for more than 20 years, the last time the compact came up for renegotiation. The U.S. maintains that nuclear compensation was dealt with in a “full and final settlement” and cannot be reopened.Marshallese Senator David Paul — who is on the islands’ negotiating committee and also represents Kwajalein Atoll, which is home to a major U.S. military base — said continuing high cancer rates and the displacement of people remain huge issues.“Everyone knows the negotiations at that time were not fair or equitable,” Paul said. “When you look at the total cost of property damage and the ongoing health issues to date, it’s a drop in the bucket. It’s an insult.”Various estimates put the true cost of the damage at about $3 billion, including for repairs to a massive nuclear waste facility known as the Cactus Dome which environmentalists say is leaking toxic waste into the ocean.A report to Congress last year from the U.S. Department of Energy said the dome contains over 100,000 cubic yards (76,000 cubic meters) of radioactively contaminated soil and debris but the structure wasn’t in any immediate danger of failing. The report concluded that any contaminated groundwater flowing beneath the structure was not measurably impacting the environment.As it did in earlier compact negotiations, the U.S. has stonewalled discussions on the nuclear legacy, something that American officials acknowledge.“We know that’s important, but there is a full and final settlement, and both sides agreed to it,” said a senior U.S. official who wasn’t authorized to publicly discuss the issue and spoke on condition of anonymity. “So, that issue is just not subject to being reopened. But, we’re still quite willing to work with the (Marshallese) on the broader issues that are important to us and that’s what we hope to do.”The U.S. State Department said the Indo-Pacific is central to U.S. foreign policy.“We are prioritizing achieving success in the negotiations related to the Compacts with the Freely Associated States as a regional foreign policy objective,” the department said.The frustrations of the Marshallese were apparent in a letter sent last month by Foreign Minister Casten Nemra to Rep. Katie Porter, a California Democrat who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee’s oversight and investigations panel.“The State and Interior Department officials involved have been unwilling to discuss an agenda for the talks and tried to confine the discussion to their own limited proposals,” Nemra wrote. “The nuclear issue clearly was one reason. All issues raised by the Marshall Islands were met with assertions that they did not have authority to discuss the matters without any indication that they would seek it.”Sen. Paul said the American approach needs to change.“I believe the U.S. has the legal and moral obligation to make sure they clean up this debris,” Paul said. “We want to make sure we get a better deal this time around. As they say, the third time is a charm.”___Lee reported from Washington."

But it took Jonathan Petit just $43 and a laser pointer to confuse and defeat them,”proclaimed Business Insider’s Danielle Muoio. “When Petit attacked the lidar, he became one of the first researchers to show how easy it is to hack self-driving cars’ sensors. He was able to trick a sensor into thinking objects were there when they weren’t, and vice versa.”“Anybody can go online and get access to this, buy it really quickly, and just assemble it, and there you go, you have a device that can spoof lidar,”said Petit. “So here, you can think that the potential consequence of an attack like this could be ‘I tried to crash you into a vehicle ahead of you because I’m telling you there is no object here. So I’m making [the sensors] blind, and now your system thinks it’s free.”Business Insider also claimed that the exploit could be used to swerve the car by tricking its security systems, consequently throwing it off the road or moving it to a quiet place convenient for criminals.“So now you’ve changed the path of the vehicle by doing this, that’s also an impact, which means that then the risk could be ‘I’m sending you to small street to stop you and rob you or steal the car,'” Petit explained. “I indeed have the unfortunate feeling that they look at security as an add-on, which is a problem. You should use this opportunity to have security by design and not doing it after thought.”Earlier this month,Uber acknowledged that their current self-driving cars are a danger to bicyclesjust weeksafter the California DMV demanded that the company stop testing their cars on the road without first seeking a permit.In March,a Google self-driving car collided with a bus, crumpling the car, however no passengers in either vehicle were injured.Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Talks start at 1230 GMT.GERMAN SOLUTIONSForeign ministers from the EU’s six founding countries — France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg — are expected to meet on Saturday in Berlin, according to European sources.French President Francois Hollande will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel next week to discuss “European initiatives”, expected on Monday.FRANCO-GERMAN INITIATIVEThe Merkel Hollande meet-up could be the occasion to announce plans for a long-rumoured Franco-German initiative on a better integrated defence and security strategy for Europe.The leaders are seeking to use the plan to dispel doubts on the EU project unleashed by the British vote campaign.BRUSSELS ACTSOn Monday the European Commission’s top officials, who are nominated by the EU’s 28 member states, begin mapping out the long road to an official Brexit at an extraordinary meeting in Brussels.MEPs have also called for an extraordinary session of the European Parliament to be held in Brussels on Monday in the case of a Brexit vote.THE ‘BREXIT’ SUMMITThe 28 EU leaders — still including British Prime Minister David Cameron — meet on June 28 and 29 in Brussels to digest and debate the results of Thursday’s Leave vote.It was originally due to be held on June 23 but was postponed after the British referendum date was announced.Cameron may trigger Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty, officially notifying EU leaders of Britain’s intention to leave.ENTER SLOVAKIAOn July 1st, the Netherlands hands over the EU’s six-month rotating presidency to the relatively inexperienced Slovakia, which now must lead the negotiations towards Brexit.Britain had been due to take the helm at the end of 2017 but will now give that up.CRUEL SUMMEREU civil servants delay summer holidays to begin the painstaking legal work to bring about Brexit.

He says he would never have made the journey if he knew he would be humiliated this way.Abu Assali also says he would still like to live in the United States if he is allowed and that he believes “America has democracy, freedoms and human rights” despite what happened.He spoke to The Associated Press in the Syrian capital on Wednesday.Abu Assali also said that he believes Trump’s ban is an “individual” act that does not reflect the position of the U.S. government.___5:30 p.m.A top European Union official says the U.S. clarifications shielding EU nationals with dual citizenship from the travel ban imposed by U.S. President Trump does not change the bloc’s fierce opposition to the order.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told the European Parliament on Wednesday that what made Trump’s order even worse was its Jan. 27 release date on the worldwide Holocaust Remembrance Day.She said, beyond commemorating the millions of Jews killed by Nazism, it also was a day “to reject any discrimination and to reflect on our duty to host those fleeing persecution.”Mogherini also urged Trump “to pay attention to what is happening in his own country.”___5:15 p.m.Iranian-born Swedish actress Bahar Pars, who hopes to share an Oscar for best foreign film, says she and fellow actor Rolf Lassgard “have decided to travel” to the Academy Awards ceremony despite the confusion around U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel ban.Pars, who got Swedish citizenship in 1995, said by traveling to the prestigious Feb. 26 ceremony in Los Angeles “the effect will be a lot bigger.” The 37-year-old actress holds both Swedish and Iranian passports.She tells The Associated Press that “standing there together and holding hands is a statement in itself” on Trump’s temporary immigration ban against seven majority-Muslim countries, including her native Iran.Pars stars in Sweden’s entry “A Man Called Ove.”____3:40 p.m.An American lawyer says hundreds of Yemenis with U.S. visas are stranded in the tiny African state of Djibouti because of President Donald Trump’s ban on entry for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries.Lawyer Julie Goldberg told The Associated Press on Wednesday that “these are all the children, parents and the spouses of U.S. citizens.” She says they are not refugees and that more than half of the more than 200 Yemenis are children.Speaking from Djibouti, Goldberg says she obtained a court order dated Tuesday from the U.S. District Court in California’s central district instructing the U.S. government to not enforce Trump’s executive order and allow the Yemenis to fly to the United States.She seeks an airline that will comply with the order.Yemen has been engulfed in conflict since 2014.___2:40 p.m.British Prime Minister Theresa May says Donald Trump’s refugee ban is “divisive and wrong” — four days after she insisted it was a matter for the U.S. government.Trump’s ban on citizens of seven majority Muslim nations entering the U.S. for 90 days — and all refugees for 120 days — has sparked protests in Britain, along with calls for Trump’s state visit later this year to be scrapped.Asked about the travel ban at a news conference in Turkey on Saturday, May said that “the United States is responsible for the United States’ policy on refugees.”But on Wednesday she told lawmakers in the House of Commons that “this government is clear that that policy is wrong. We wouldn’t do it … We believe it is divisive and wrong.”___2: 05 p.m.Five U.N. human rights experts say President Donald Trump’s move to bar entry to the United States to citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries violates U.S. obligations on human rights.The five, who are commissioned by the United Nations, said in a statement issued in Geneva on Wednesday that Trump’s executive order signed last week is “clearly discriminatory” and leads to greater stigmatization of Muslims.The order bars nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from U.S. entry for 90 days.The five U.N. special rapporteurs are François Crépeau on migrants; Mutuma Ruteere on racism; Ben Emmerson on human rights and counter-terrorism; Nils Melzer on torture and Ahmed Shaheed on freedom of religion.They cited U.S. obligations to protect the principles of “non-refoulement” — or not chasing away people who have a right to protection — and nondiscrimination based on race, nationality or religion.They said the United States’ responsibility “must extend to offering refuge” to people fleeing Iraq and Syria, citing U.S. participation in conflicts in those countries.___12:45 p.m.The United Arab Emirates’ top diplomat has come out in defense of President Donald Trump’s order temporarily barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering.Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said Wednesday that the United States was within its rights to take what he said was a “sovereign decision” concerning immigration.He says he does not believe the move was based on religion, and noted that the majority of the world’s Muslim-majority countries were not covered by the order.Sheikh Abdullah spoke following talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Abu Dhabi.The Emirates is one of the United States’ closest Arab allies. It is part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group and hosts American troops and warplanes taking part.___11:45 a.m.Iran’s state TV is reporting that President Hassan Rouhani has lashed out at the recent executive order by U.S. president Donald Trump to suspend immigration and visa processes for nationals from seven majority-Muslim countries, including Iran.Rouhani described Trump and his administration as newcomers who don’t understand politics, saying, “A man had been living in another world and now has entered the world of politics.”Rouhani also said that Trump would end up harming not only his own nation but other countries as well.Rouhani called the American administration dishonest for claiming to be on the side of the Iranian people, but then banning them."

The first reads, “Hillary Clinton’s favorable rating at 36%.”Again, nothing about this being a record.The second sub-headline reads “Clinton remains a polarizing political figure,” as though 64 percent of Americans not seeing her as favorable is not about as close to a consensus as you will find in a country split 50/50 on pretty much everything else.Finally, at the end of the first paragraph, we are at long last informed that this is a “record low.”Prior to this poll, Hillary’s record low favorable rating was 39 percent.What’s more, President Trump’s favorability rating is a full 5 points higher than Hillary’s — 41 percent, and this is despite the fact we have a corrupt establishment media battering and blistering him 24/7, while Hillary is treated like the wronged woman who would be president were it not for those damn dirty Russians.Moreover, Gallup is always an outlier, an unreliable pollster that for some inexplicable reason polls “all adults,” instead of aiming for the much more reliable numbers you get when screening for “registered voters” or “likely voters.”Oh wait, it is not “inexplicable” at all — “all adult” polls always come out better for Democrats.A good example of this is Gallup’s weekly poll gauging Trump’s job approval. If you look at the Real Clear Politicspoll of polls, Gallup is the only pollster polling the utterly useless “all adults.” Because of this, Gallup usually comes in with the lowest approval ratings for Trump — at least until the even more unreliable Quinnipiac stumbles in.But think about how partisan a polling company has to be to hide thebig newsthat a major public figure like Hillary Clinton has just hit a record low in  favorability — her lowest in more than a quarter century of polling.In this world of social media, where headlines are everything, if you want clicks, you put your big news in that headline. So it is obvious Gallup did not want that headline out there — did not want Twitter and Facebook spreading the news that Precious Hillary is scraping an all-new barrel bottom.Another deception in Gallup’s so-called analysis is the ludicrous premise Hillary has retreated from the political stage.“She has tended to be quite popular when she is no longer seen as a purely political figure,” Gallup accurately explains, before adding this bunk: “Clinton’s 2016 loss has largely thrust her off the political stage, though she released a memoir of the campaign last year and has made periodic public appearances.”What in heaven’s name is Gallup talking about? Hillary is everywhere — on top of her sore loser book tour, she’s all over —  on Twitter, on talk shows, speaking engagements, interviews, andMurphy Browncameos.In my 30-plus years of watching politics, never before have I seen a losing presidential candidate so desperate to remain in the limelight. This even includes John Kerry and John McCain, who returned to the U.S. Senate after their respective ’04 and ’08 losses.What makes Hillary’s record low even more remarkable is that during the early ’90s,  most especially in the early days of her husband’s ’92 presidential campaign and in ’93 and ’94 when, as First Lady, she lobbied to make Hillarycare (government-run healthcare) the law of the land, few people in America were more disliked than Hillary. She was never more off-putting, dishonest, and polarizing. But even that cannot top her latest era, the era of the sore loser with the secret email server who refuses to leave the stage.As of now, only 77 percent of Democrats have a favorable opinion of Hillary, which statistically ties with a previous low of 76 percent. Only 30 percent of Independents and four percent of Republicans agree.Meanwhile, since winning the election, Trump’s favorability has climbed from 34 percent to 41 percent — even in this dumb poll.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC.Follow his Facebook Pagehere."

956278580,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA2UEAO80,Pope joins tweeting masses with Pontifex handle,"(AP) Pope joins tweeting masses with Pontifex handleBy NICOLE WINFIELDAssociated PressVATICAN CITYBenedict XVI, the pope known for his hefty volumes of theology, is now trying brevity _ spreading the faith through his own Twitter account.The pontiff will tweet in eight languages starting Dec. 12 using his personal handle (at)Pontifex, responding live to questions about faith during his weekly general audience, the Vatican said Monday.Within six hours of the Vatican’s announcement, Benedict had already garnered nearly 150,000 followers on the English version of (at)Pontifex alone, with thousands more following him in the eight other language accounts.All that, and he hadn’t even sent a single tweet.He may never hit 1 billion faithful that the Catholic Church counts around the globe, but he’s odds-on to get 1 million followers by the end of the year, British bookmakers Ladbrokes said.The pope sent his first tweet last year from a generic Vatican account to launch the Holy See’s news information portal, part of efforts to increase the church presence in social media and spread the faith. A personal Twitter account for the 85-year-old Benedict has been the subject of intense speculation ever since; Monday’s news conference was packed, a strong indication of the interest it has generated.Greg Burke, the Vatican’s communications adviser, said the handle (at)Pontifex was chosen because it not only means pope in Latin, but also bridge-builder, suggesting unity. How often will the pope tweet? “As often as he wants,” Burke said, adding that he hoped the tweeting would be frequent.While the pope will push the button himself on Dec. 12, subsequent tweets will be sent by someone in the Vatican’s secretariat of state. They will, however, all be approved by the pope, officials said.“It’s always going to have his engagement and his approval,” said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the No. 2 in the Vatican’s social communications office. “Not physically, but from his mind.”Questions for the inaugural papal tweet can be submitted to (hash)askpontifex, and the pope will likely respond to three to five of those sent from around the world, Burke said. Subsequent tweets are expected to remain spiritual in nature, taken from his teachings or homilies.By late Monday, many of the questions sent in were jokes and criticism, including of the church sex abuse scandal _ Twitter spam that the pope will likely never see.Currently a host of Twitter accounts use the pope’s name, purporting to be his personal account. The (at)Pontifex account, however, is certified as the only official papal Twitter feed, Tighe said. No special security arrangements have been taken to prevent the account from being hacked.Burke said Twitter has many celebrity clients. “They seem to be able to take care of them. We assume they’ll be able to take care of us as well.”Twitter spokeswoman Rachael Horowitz declined to comment on whether the strong interest in the launch of the pope’s handle would break any records, saying Twitter doesn’t track such data of individual account followers.But she noted in an email that religious content on Twitter “punches above its weight” in terms of interest and engagement. Religious leaders, for example, get one retweet for every 500 followers, whereas a musician gets one for every 30,000 followers.Papal tweets will be sent simultaneously in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Polish and Arabic. Monsignor Claudio Maria Celli, the president of the Vatican’s social communications office, said he hoped to add Chinese.He stressed that the papal tweets aren’t to be considered infallible teachings, merely “pearls of wisdom” in the pope’s own words.The Vatican has been increasing its presence in social media, using YouTube channels and Facebook pages for special events and Twitter to engage believers and nonbelievers alike, particularly the young.The Vatican decided against using a personal Facebook page for the pope because they thought it was too personal an interaction and would require more manpower to keep updated.___Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield"

Please note that I used the word “admitted,” not “confirmed,” or “verified.” That’s an important distinction.You see, theTimesand the rest of the corporate media did not do any additional reporting to verify thePoststory. All the dishonest sneaks at theTimesdid wasadmitthat thePost’sstory was true, and because they are such dishonest sneaks, they did so in paragraph 27.Paragraph 27.Just stop and think about how corrupt theNew York Timesis to bury that bombshell in paragraph 27….We have a laptop filled with compromising information about Joe Biden and his son, email after email detailing the Biden family’s overseas influence peddling, and theTimesbasically says,Oh, yes, all this is true about the sitting president of the United States… in paragraph 27.Democrats sure got it good …  and anyone who subscribes to theNew York Timesis an idiot.Where was I?Oh, yes, my point… And I do have one…Let’s not forget there’s a face behind the laptop story, a person, a real person,a real journalist,and that for the last 18 months, everyone in the corporate media, from theNew York Timesto NPR to CNN to MSNBC,  have defamed this journalist as at best a Russian dupe and at worst a Russian operative.Her name is Emma-Jo Morris, and it’s her byline on what was and still is the biggest scandal of the 2020 presidential election. And for the sin of breaking a true, accurate, and consequential story, her work (and let’s not forget herNew York Postcolleague, Miranda Devine, who also did some heavy lifting), and by extension, her journalistic reputation was attacked, and not just by the corporate media, but by Joe Biden, his press secretary Lyin’ Ginger, and the beta boys that run Twitter and Facebook.All of them, every single one of them, attacked-attacked-attacked her work as Russian disinformation when they all knew the story was true.Of course, they knew it was true. Not only had thePostverified the emails, but it was also easy for the rest of the media to verify the emails.Did you receive/send this email to Hunter Biden?That’s not difficult. I’m no journalist, and even I could do that. And you know the corporate mediadiddo that,didreceive confirmation, and still went ahead and deceived the public with their “Russian disinformation” lie.But, you see, publicly verifying the laptop story required something our corporate media do not have—and that’s a sense of ethics and moral courage.But I want to return to Emma-Jo Morris, who is now a colleague at Breitbart News. When I told her I was going to write this piece, here (with her permission) was her reply. “I’m not losing sleep at night over their baseless smears,” she told me, “but they absolutely owe the American people an apology for lying to them.” And that’s why she’s agood reporter. She’s an adult, not a baby who can’t wait to play the victim.Nevertheless, put yourselves in her shoes…You flawlessly report out the most consequential story of the 2020 presidential campaign, a true story, a story about the worst kind of political corruption, a story that matters, a story thatstill matters(I’ll get to that in a second), and your own government and everyone in your own profession and the billionaires in Silicon Valley, not only team up to kill your true story, by extension, they question your character and ethics.Have you ever been falsely accused of something? I have. It’s pretty goddamned awful. But even I can’t imagine living through this:Screenshot/PoliticoScreenshot/Max Boot/TwitterScreengrab/CNNScreenshot/Mother Jones/TwitterScreenshot/NPRY’all know I could fill the Internet with this stuff… Which brings me to my next point….Now that the corporate media have admitted — in the sneakiest, most underhanded, and dishonest way imaginable — that Emma-Jo’s reporting is dead-on, if not an apology, how about some follow-up?After all, what we have here is documented proof from the president’s own son of foreign influence peddling. How could anyone who identifies as a journalist not turn this laptop bonanza into a full-fledged feeding frenzy?And maybe there are some of you in the corporate media who feel deceived. Perhaps you honestly did believe those 50 godlessDeep StatersandBrian StelterandMother Jonesand Max Boot and Ben Rhodes…. Maybe I’m not giving you the benefit of the doubt.  Well, then, prove it. Get angry.Joe Bidenlied to you.Jennifer Psakilied to you. The Deep State lied to you. Your own colleagues lied to you.Don’t you care about corruption?Don’t you care about being lied to?Don’t you want to fix a profession so broken a hack like Maggie Haberman wins a Pulitzer for spreading a hoax while Emma-Jo Morris’s work and name were defamed?Regardless… The least, the very least you can do, is apologize.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC.Follow his Facebook Pagehere."

Rick Scott removes himself from recount process,"Nov. 14 (UPI) — Florida officials want more time to recount ballots in key electoral races — one of which involves Gov. Rick Scott, who removed himself Wednesday from the recount process.Election officials say they need the extra time to recount all the ballots, particularly after hitting a technical snag with the counting equipment.Efforts in Palm Beach County were stalled late Tuesday when counting equipment overheated and stopped working.Even before the machines malfunctioned, election officials said they would not be able to meet the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline to submit final recount numbers for two key races. Gov Rick Scott still leads the race for Sen. Bill Nelson’s congressional seat, and Republican Ron DeSantis leads Democrat Andrew Gillum in the race for governor.The deadline to file final tallies has been pushed back to Tuesday.A judge originally granted election officials more time after the equipment malfunction, but Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner’s attorneys moved the lawsuit to federal court Tuesday before the order could be signed.If the deadline isn’t extended, original election night figures from Palm Beach County will be submitted, with an explanation for why the county failed to meet the deadline for a recount, per Florida election law.Wednesday, Scott said he will recuse himself from participating in the recount process to avoid potential conflicts of interest. He did the same thing in 2014 in a close race for re-election for governor.The most recent tallies have Scott ahead of Nelson by 12,100 votes and DeSantis up on Gillum by about 50,000.Scott and President Donald Trump have criticized recount efforts in Florida, with Trump calling ballots in the state “massively infected.” He urged the state to go with the original election night results, which gave the Republican candidates the lead.No evidence of fraud has been uncovered, officials have said."

7973653874,https://www.breitbart.com/news/head-of-italys-economic-heartland-fights-lockdown/,Head of Italy’s economic heartland fights lockdown,"Rome (AFP) – The head of Milan’s economically vital Lombardy region began waging a lonely campaign Thursday to get Italy to reopen for business and follow the lead of some smaller European nations.Attilo Fontana’s messages on Facebook created a political firestorm in a country still coming to terms with a virus that has killed 21,645 and brought the economy to its knees.Italy’s official toll — believed to be substantially underreported — was the world’s highest until being overtaken by the United States last weekend.Its economic one is growing fast as well.The International Monetary Fund expects Italy’s total output to shrink by 9.1 percent this year — the worst peacetime decline in nearly a century.The Confindustria big business lobby estimates that each week of the national lockdown chops another 0.75 percent off the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) figure.Millions of Italians are either furloughed or suddenly unemployed.Lombardy boss Fontana sounded like he had had enough when he posted a message outlining his 10-million-strong region’s “road to freedom”.He said businesses should follow basic social distancing rules and reopen when the current nationwide lockdown expires on May 4.“We are not courting controversy,” Fontana said in a second post that responded the chorus of political criticism his first one drew late Wednesday.“But let’s look at the substance: many other European countries already beginning to reopen. We need to start thinking about our own future immediately.”Other European nations are eyeing ends to their own shutdowns with extreme caution.Denmark has started reopening schools for younger children and Finland lifted a blockade of Helsinki.Lithuania has allowed some small shops to resume operations.But most big European nations are extending the closures for at least a few more weeks.‘An error’The vibrant Lombardy region had been punching above its weight until the pandemic hit.It makes up over a fifth of the Mediterranean country’s economy and is home to the Italian headquarters of numerous global firms.But it also recorded more than half of Italy’s officially recorded COVID-19 deaths.Most Italian officials still follow the advice of doctors who think it is best to keep the nation locked until new infections sharply drop off.Deputy Industry Minister Stefano Buffagni called Fontana’s message “an error”.Milan mayor Beppe Sala accused Fontana of shifting his position from alarm about the virus to one ordering “everyone outside”.“A little more restraint would not be too much to ask for,” Sala told La Repubblica newspaper.“I am not against an economic recovery, because it affects the work of so many people,” the Milan mayor said.“But we must provide adequate guarantees first to those who go to work.”Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has been widely applauded for his handing of what is widely viewed as Italy’s worst crisis since World War II.His popularity rose and Italy’s endless political battles appeared to abate as the nation rallied around the single cause of fighting the disease.But Conte acknowledged that his decision last Friday to extend Italy’ month-long shutdown for another three weeks was not popular.“It is a difficult but necessary decision for which I assume full political responsibility,” Conte told the nation."

IS did not exist as an organization until about June 2014.However, the memo details the situation “worsened after U.S. troops left Iraq, helping quickly deteriorate the situation further.” Unmentioned is that the bulk of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq took place under the Obama administration and was completed by December 2011.The memo further relates IS is armed with U.S.-made weapons seized from Iraq troops. The weapons seizures took place largely after the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.Regarding the “creation” of IS, the memo states:“When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 we triggered a massive insurgency against our presence,” the memo stated. “Around this time, a Jordanian ex-convict named Zarqawi travelled to Iraq with one goal: to establish a religious state just for Sunni Muslims.”“…Zarqawi was killed by American forces in 2006. His successors now lead the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).”The memo further outlines the origins of some of the terrorist group’s weapons:ISIS owns hundreds of millions of dollars of sophisticated weapons, including vehicles and GPS-equipped weapons. Many of these are American-made and were captured from Iraqi troops.The memo depicts IS as the “most extreme and powerful Sunni jihadist group worldwide and has rapidly taken control of large parts of Iraq and Syria.”The descriptions are a far cry from Obama’s classification of IS as “a jayvee team” in aNew Yorkerinterviewreleased January, 2014.The October 2014 memo details the number of fighters IS was thought to possess at the time:Fighters: 20,000-31,500 fighters, and as many as 15,000 of them are believed to be foreign recruits. Those 15,000 come from 80 different countries. Reports indicate that approximately 100 are from the United States.Earlier this month, Trump sought to spotlight the role the Obama administration’s policies played in leading to the deteriorating Middle East security situation that aided in IS’s rise to power.“ISIS is honoring President Obama,” Trump said at an August 10rallyin Broward County. “He is the founder of ISIS. He is the founder of ISIS, okay? He is the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.”During aradio interviewwith Hugh Hewitt, Trump clarified his remarks about Obama founding IS: “He was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, okay?”In a follow uptweet, Trump indicated his comments about Obama founding IS were sarcastic, seemingly explaining that he didn’t mean the president actually founded IS but was referring to Obama’s policies.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

No word on whether Roger has yet contacted Martinez.TheLos Angeles Timesrecalled Martinez pushing for more stringent gun control laws in his speech, calling on the audience to put pressure on elected officials to act. TheTimeslater updated its article to report: “Martinez never said the word gun throughout his entire speech.”Two California Democrat state legislators came out with a “gun violence restraining order” just two days after the mass killings,accordingto AWR Hawkins of Breitbar tNews. The measure would allow guns to be taken away from owners who have no recorded mental illness, but are reported by a family member who asserts that the owner has a mental health issue. Hawkins reports that the organization responsible for the idea also advocates gun confiscation for issues such as “drug or alcohol abuse.”At the scene of the IV Deli murder of Michaels-Martinez, one sign advocating gun control was affixed to the outer wall. Not long after, another sign advocating “knife control” was placed right next to it.However, as Hawkinsreported, the failed Senate bill that would have expanded background checks would not have prevented the Isla Vista murderer from obtaining guns.In speaking withBreitbart Newslast weekend, UCSB student Lindsay spoke of a desire to not see the attacks last Friday night that left six dead and 13 injured, politicized."

4944560685,http://www.breitbart.com/news/trumps-muslim-ban-from-simple-clarity-to-plain-confusion/,Trump’s Muslim ban: From simple clarity to plain confusion,"NEW YORK (AP) — From the moment he first declared it, the plan has been a signature of his campaign for president: “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”Yet from that first moment, the Republican White House candidate has evaded questions when pressed for details. Now that he’s a presumptive nominee with sliding poll numbers, his spokeswoman says he’s no longer seeking the ban at all.In its place, he’s offering an approach based on a standard of terrorism that he and his campaign refuse to define.The ban idea originated with 28 direct and forceful words, issued immediately after the December shootings in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people. The blanket nature of the proposal, which appeared to stretch beyond immigration to include any member of the Muslim faith seeking to cross the U.S. border, provoked a flurry of questions.Would it apply to U.S. citizens traveling or living abroad? Members of the armed forces? What about foreign leaders seeking to visit the U.S., such as Jordan’s King Abdullah II — a staunch American ally? Or Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai?In response to questions that day from The Associated Press, Trump’s campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski, said the ban would apply to “everybody” — including tourists and Muslims seeking immigration visas.Trump’s campaign refused to respond to additional questions, including how the U.S. would determine a person’s religious beliefs. Instead, Trump offered the following statement, delivered to AP via email: “Because I am so politically correct, I would never be the one to say. You figure it out!”In the following days, he did offer shades of new detail. His ban would include exemptions, including for athletes and world leaders. As he got closer to winning the GOP nomination, his language softened further. Shortly after endorsing the billionaire businessman, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie suggested Trump had walked away from the plan entirely.“That’s not what he says any longer,” Christie told ABC News in February. “He’s backed off of that position over the course of time.”He hadn’t. But Trump was now stressing the “temporary” nature.“It’s a temporary ban. It hasn’t been called for yet, nobody’s done it,” he said on Fox News Radio in May. “This is just a suggestion until we find out what’s going on.” He told Fox News Channel, “I’d like to back off as soon as possible because, frankly, I would like to see something happen. But we have to be vigilant.”Then came this month’s Orlando shootings. A day after the attack that left 49 people dead, he appeared to return to his call for a blanket ban on Muslims — at least for a time.“I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger. But now … many are saying that I was right to do so.  And although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. We have to do it,” he said. “It will be lifted, this ban, when and as a nation we’re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country.”In that speech, Trump added a new element to his proposal: “When I’m elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.”Once again, he had issued a policy proposal with little detail. Did this replace the Muslim ban, or was it an addition? What qualified as a “proven history of terrorism”? Would he halt immigration from the United Kingdom, France and Belgium, all targeted by Islamic extremists? What about Turkey, a NATO ally? Would Christians from Syria and Jews from Israel be barred?Two days after delivering his Orlando speech, Trump was asked by Fox News Channel’s Greta Van Susteren several times whether he still supported his original ban. He gave no indication his position had changed: “Greta, as you know it’s temporary,” he said.Then, during a visit to a pair of his golf courses in Scotland this past weekend, Trump said he would have no issue with a Muslim from the U.K. coming to the U.S. And, following an outburst on Twitter, campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said he no longer supports his original ban and only wants to limit immigration from states with extremist elements.Trump went on to tell Bloomberg News on Saturday, “I want terrorists out. I want people that have bad thoughts out. I would limit specific terrorist countries, and we know who those terrorist countries are.”But in a separate interview that day, Trump suggested he wasn’t actually proposing a hard ban on immigration from “terrorist countries,” but only that people from such states — which he would not specify — should be strongly screened.“When you have a terrorist country, and you have a country that’s loaded up with terrorism, we don’t want the people coming in until they’re very strongly vetted,” he told DailyMail.com.Asked to clarify whether Trump still supports a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. as originally proposed, a ban of immigration from states associated with terrorism, as he said in his post-Orlando speech, or strong vetting of people coming into the country from such nations, as he said this past weekend in Scotland, Hicks said: “Mr. Trump stated a position consistent with his speech two weeks ago.”“He has been very clear,” she added in an email Monday. It’s the press, she said, that has “tried to cause confusion.”___Follow Jill Colvin on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/colvinj"

Strikes Down Trump’s Plan to Punish Sanctuary Cities,"A federal judge in Los Angeles this week struck down the Trump administration’s policy of denying certain Department of Justice law enforcement grants to cities that adopt “sanctuary” policies and refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement.TheLos Angeles Timesreports:U.S. District Judge Manuel Real issued a permanent, nationwide ban against a Justice Department policy that gave an edge to obliging police departments applying for a community policing grant program. In doing so, Real dealt a legal setback to the Trump administration in its aggressive campaign to crack down on illegal immigration and to force compliance from law enforcement officials.…Calling the ruling “overbroad and inconsistent with the rule of law,” a Justice Department spokesman said the government was within its rights to give preference to departments that assisted in immigration enforcement.“The Department has the lawful discretion to give additional consideration for jurisdictions that prioritize the safety of their communities and their law enforcement officers when they promise to cooperate with federal immigration authorities seeking information about illegal aliens who have committed crimes,” Devin M. O’Malley said in a statement.The ruling follows a similar decision in San Francisco late last year. As Breitbart Newsreportedat the time:U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick III issued a permanent injunction Monday against President Donald Trump’s executive order directing that federal funds be withheld from “sanctuary city” jurisdictions.…Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum clarifying the Department of Justice’s interpretation of the order, stipulating that the federal funds to be withheld would be limited to discretionary grants from the department to local law enforcement authorities.But the judge said in July that memorandum was not enough to stop other agencies from interpreting the executive order in a broader sense, and that the memorandum could easily be withdrawn.The battle will likely continue as the California judgments go through theappeals process.Joel B.

If you want Nancy Pelosi to be your next U.S. senator, you have a candidate running that’s perfect.

In the statement, Cameron opined that the murder was a betrayal of Islam and Britain’s Muslim communities.In the debate that followed, Pearson, who led Ukip at the last general election, told his fellow peers “My lords, are the government aware that Fusilier Rigby’s murderers quoted 22 verses of the Koran to justify their atrocity? Therefore, is the Prime Minister accurate or helpful when he describes it as a betrayal of Islam? Since the vast majority of Muslims are our peace-loving friends, should we not encourage them to address the violence in the Koran – and indeed in the life and the example of Muhammad?”The Leader of the Lords, Lady Stowell of Beeston, who had conveyed the statement to the chamber immediately distanced herself from his remarks, saying “My lords, British Muslims want strong counter-terrorism measures in this country so that everybody in this country who shares British values, whatever their faith, is safe. That is basically all I need to say to the noble lord.”His comments drew angry criticism from Labour MP Khalid Mahmood, who said: “Virtually everybody has condemned – and I, again, for the record condemn – the atrocious attack on Lee Rigby. This [intervention by Pearson] is just complete nonsense. Obviously he hasn’t read the Koran. Islam is about submission to the Almighty. It is not about war against anybody else.”“I find it absolutely offensive that this guy is still able to say this. I will actually tomorrow make a complaint formally to the Lords speaker on this issue. This is not tolerable and it should not be tolerated at all.”Mahmood was joined in his criticism by fellow Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi, who said “These are lies. Trying to say this comes from some text in the Qur’an or there is some justification in the religion – it isn’t there. To suggest that Muslims should be apologising and somehow having to take responsibility for the actions of a handful of people is absolutely diabolical. This is nonsensical rubbish.”But Ukip has stood by Lord Pearson, arguing that there should be more debate around the content of the Koran. A spokesman said: “What Lord Pearson is doing is calling on Islamic scholars to treat the Koran as Christian scholars treat the Bible – to use it as a subject for debate and discourse around the core message.“He is talking about how Islamic scholars are constrained by the comprehension that the Koran is the perfect word of God unencumbered by human frailty, unlike the Bible. In contrast the apostles are human and like all human things are prone to error.”After killing Rigby, Michael Adebolajo crossed the street to make a statement recorded on a passer-by’s mobile phone. Speaking with a London accent he said “Through many passages in the Koran we must fight them as they fight us. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I apologise that women had to witness this today but in our lands women have to see the same.”He also handed a blood-stained letter to witnesses in which he justified his actions and those of his accomplice, Michael Adebolawe. The note began “To my beloved children know that to fight Allah’s enemies is an obligation. The proofs of which are so numerous that but a handful of any of them cuts out the bewitching tongues of the Munafiqeen.“Do not spend your days in endless dispute with the cowardly and foolish if it means it will delay you meeting Allah’s enemies on the battlefield. Sometimes the cowardly and foolish could be those dearest to you so be prepared to turn away from them.”It concluded by citing references to 22 passages from the Koran, divided into five groups. They were:Group 1. 4:69-76, 4:84, 9:41Group 2. 9:24, 9:39, 9:46, 9:87, 9:93Group 3. 9:67, 3:173, 47:20, 9:86, 9:31, 9:51-55, 8:5-6, 2:170Group 4. 3:160, 9:119, 9:123Group 5. 9:37, 2:216, 3:142Surah 9:24 reads “Say, [or “O Prophet, tell them”], “If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.”"

They became the eleventh No. 15 seed to defeat a No. 2 seed and the third in the past two years. Brett Comer’s alley-oop to Chase Fieler in the closing minutes brought the house down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as Comer tossed the ball high above the rim after breaking a frenetic Georgetown press and Fieler came running in, elbow above the rim, and jammed the ball home.The Georgetown Hoyas suffered yet another humiliating early round exit, this time at the hands of the unheralded Florida-Gulf Coast Eagles. Under John Thompson III, the Hoyas have been defeated by double-digit seeds like No. 14 Ohio and No. 11 VCU.The first half was a back and forth affair, with the Hoyas taking a 7-point lead before the Eagles came back, tying the game 20-20 at the 4:27 mark of the first half and taking the lead 22-20 less than a minute later.The Eagles led by two, 24-22 at the half. Georgetown hit only 33% of its shots, and the Eagles outscored the much larger Hoyas in the paint.The Eagles broke the game open with a 17-1 run in the second half, stretching their lead to 21 at one point and holding a 15 point lead with under 4 minutes to go.The Hoyas closed the gap to 9 with under 3 minutes to go, as Jabril Trawick and Otto Porter hit back-to-back three pointers, and to seven before the Eagles extended the lead again with an emphatic dunk.The last two minutes featured a furious comeback attempt by Georgetown, as Markel Starks and D’Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored for the Hoyas to close the gap to four with 51 second left.The Eagles made their free throws down the stretch, in stark contrast to the Hoyas, who shot free throws well below their season average and missed 20 three pointers on the night.Otto Porter, playing in what may well be his last game for the Hoyas, scored 13 with 11 rebounds but only shot 5 of 17 in the loss.Sherwood Brown scored 24 for the Eagles."

You know, where the salesman with the slicked back hair and the bad cologne tries to stick you with a lemon. His job is to get you off the lot at sticker price before you realize the car has no power steering or air conditioning.Well that is exactly what we have seen from the very beginning with the president’s healthcare overhaul boondoggle known as Obamacare. (The Obama administration has already given businesses aone-year delayfor implementation, conveniently shifting the mess past Election Day 2014, while businesses are moving to hire morepart-time workersto avoid the penalties required by the law.)As Judicial Watch uncovered, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has used every trick in the book to shove Obamacare down our throats. The agency bankrolled a$200 million propaganda campaignto “persuade” the American people that the healthcare monstrosity would be in their best interest; they even trotted out aging television star Andy Griffith for a “public service” campaign. HHS also spent $1.4 million to make“a big guerilla campaign splash”on the Internet through paid advertisements targeting Hispanics, blacks, and women.And now we learn that HHS was ready–on moment-one after Obamacare passage–to bypass compensation rules to hire a legion of high-priced government employees to push the lemon off the lot.According to documents we released this week, on the day Obamacare passed, HHS obtained permission from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to cast aside normal hiring procedures in order to hire 1,814 highly-paid, top-level administrators to expedite Obamacare implementation.According to the documentsobtained by Judicial Watch, OPM Director John Berry gave HHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources Denise Wells extraordinary “direct-hire appointing authority” (DHA) in order to bypass normal channels and, in Berry’s words, “hire quickly in order to execute the President’s directive with respect to implementing health care reform.” In all, HHS was granted permission to utilize what Wells termed the DHA “valuable human capital recruitment tool” to hire 1,814 GS 13-15 employees, including:59 Social Science Analyst/Specialists at the GS-15 level350 Health Insurance Specialists at the GS-15 level55 Administrative and Program Specialists at the GS-15 level235 Program Analysts/Management Analysts at the GS-15 level40 Accountants at the GS 15 level90 Dental Officers at the GS 14 level291 Public Health Advisors/Analysts at the GS-14 level261 Consumer Safety Officers at the GS-13 level92 Grants Management Specialists at the GS-15 level50 Criminal Investigators at the GS-13 level291 Information Technology Specialists at the GS-15 levelAccording to theBase General Schedule Pay Scale, in 2010, the nearly 2,000 new employees hired to “quickly” implement the Obamacare program would have received a salary between $70,000 and $130,000 per year. More than 1,100 of the new employees would have come in at the GS-15 level, starting at nearly $100,000 annually.TheDaily Mailtook a look at our documentsthat the Obama administration sought to spend $159 million a year on these new Obamacare government employees.But there is more.Additional documents obtained by Judicial Watch reveal that, in early 2013, Anne Filipic, the president of Enroll America (a nonprofit “tasked with selling Obamacare“), worked with then-professional staff member of the House Ways and Means Committee Debra Curtis to organize Obamacare congressional briefings explicitly excluding Republican House members and their staffs. (Filipic is a former Deputy Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement and Deputy Director at HHS.)Among the highlights from the recordsIn an email dated February 11, 2013, Curtis wrote to Filipic, “They [House Democrat leadership] want to do another one next week while Congress is in recess that would be open all House Democratic Staff [emphasis added] to start getting folks up to speed.”In email dated February 12, 2013, Curtis wrote to Filipic: “I would guess that this would be a well-attended event with upward of 100 people in attendance. We’ll check IDs to be sure we’ve got all Dems coming as well.” [Emphasis added](Once again, we see evidence that the president, who was supposed to usher in a new era of bipartisanship, has instead inspired divisiveness and exclusion.)Filipic is also at the center of a growing controversy involving possible illegal Obamacare fundraising done on behalf of Filipic’s Enroll America by her former boss at HHS, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. On May 10, 2013, theWashington Postbroke the story that in “an unusual fundraising push” Sebelius was pressuring health care industry officials regulated by HHS to make donations to Enroll America. On May 14,Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letterto Sebelius saying,“Our initial reaction is that this appears at best to be an inherent conflict of interest and at worst a potentially illegal augmentation of appropriation.”In afollow-up letter on June 27, a group of 28 Republican senators admonished Sebelius:Article I of the Constitution gives Congress alone the power of the purse. Your agency requested additional money to implement the exchanges, and Congress denied that request. You cannot evade Congress’ Constitutional power of the purse through gifts or donations to an entity that appears to be ‘just an arm of the administration,’ as one health industry official described Filipic’s Enroll America inThe Hill.The House Commerce Committeeis currently investigating the Sebelius solicitations.Even as the ill-conceived Obamacare law continues to crumble, we are learning more and more about its massive cost to the American people the and backroom politics attendant to its passage and implementation.Barack Obama and his cohorts created a bureaucratic contrivance to hand massive new powers to an already bloated federal government. And the cost in tax dollars, jobs, the rule of law, and individual freedom is becoming increasingly clear."

Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.- 4th) is asking his colleagues in Congress to censure President Obama for the executive actions on gun control announced this week.Palazzo said, “The American people demand that we fight back against this President’s overreach, and this is the best way we can fight and win.”Palazzo introduced the censure on Wednesday. Afterward, he posted the following text tohis congressional webpage:For seven years, the President has gradually expanded his powers through executive overreach. His actions this week to take away the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens is just the latest, if not most egregious, violation of the separation of powers found in the United States Constitution. Congress must go on record to stand up as an equal branch of government – both against this President and any future president who attempts to use his authority to write the law instead of enforce the law.…The House Resolution to Censure Barack Obamawould specifically censure and condemn the actions of President Obama regarding his announced actions on gun control this week. It is the latest instance of Obama’s executive overreach that includes executive amnesty, his recent climate change treaty, and the Iranian nuclear agreement. Moreover, the president has also refused to enforce several laws, as required by the Constitution, including his own health care bill and refusing to address illegal alien deportations.Presidential censure is rare, but has precedent. In 1834, President Andrew Jackson was censured by the Senate for what they saw as executive overreach when he took extraordinary measures to dismantle the Bank of the United States despite the objections of the Senate Majority. Additionally, more recent censure resolutions were introduced against President Nixon and President Bill Clinton. Censure sets both a legal and historical precedent that Congress disapproves of a president’s actions.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter:@AWRHawkins.

He was portrayed during a five-month trial as an unscrupulous politician who took bribes, rigged contracts and lived far beyond his means while in office until fall 2008.Prosecutors said Kilpatrick ran a “private profit machine” out of Detroit’s City Hall. The government presented evidence to show he got a share of the spoils after ensuring that Ferguson’s excavating company was awarded millions in work from the water department.Business owners said they were forced to hire Ferguson as a subcontractor or risk losing city contracts. Separately, fundraiser Emma Bell said she gave Kilpatrick more than $200,000 as his personal cut of political donations, pulling cash from her bra during private meetings. A high-ranking aide, Derrick Miller, told jurors that he often was the middle man, passing bribes from others.Internal Revenue Service agents said Kilpatrick spent $840,000 beyond his mayoral salary.Kilpatrick, who now lives near Dallas, declined to testify. He has long denied any wrongdoing, and defense attorney James Thomas told jurors that Kilpatrick often was showered with cash gifts from city workers and political supporters during holidays and birthdays.The government said Kilpatrick abused the Civic Fund, a nonprofit fund he created to help distressed Detroit residents. There was evidence that it was used for yoga lessons, camps for his kids, golf clubs and travel.Kilpatrick, 42, was elected in 2001 at age 31. He resigned in 2008 and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in a different scandal involving sexually explicit text messages and an extramarital affair with his chief of staff.The Democrat spent 14 months in prison for violating probation in that case after a judge said he failed to report assets that could be put toward his $1 million restitution to Detroit.Voters booted his mother, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, from Congress in 2010, partly because of a negative perception of her due to her son’s troubles."

All these claims were deployed against Senator Barry Goldwater during his 1964 presidential campaign, which was widely considered a threat to the political establishment.Countless commentators have compared Trump’s candidacy to Goldwater’s insurgent presidential run. But largely missing from the debate is how Goldwater faced some of the very same attacks made against Trump.PsychiatristsIn a rare appearance on Fox News on Sunday, Rush Limbaugh noted that Mitt Romney’s father was involved in an attempt to paint Goldwater as a crazed extremist.Limbaugh stated: “Well, it’s all that and more, but it’s not unprecedented.His dad did much the same thingagainst Barry Goldwater in a cabal with Republican establishment guys back in 1964. The establishment, this isn’t new. The establishment not wanting outsiders, not wanting conservatives, it isn’t anything new.”Indeed, theIndependent Sentinelreported: “In 1964, liberal Republicans were vehemently opposed to Barry Goldwater’s nomination for the presidency and launched a campaign against him, labeling him a crazed extremist. One of those Republicans was George Romney, Mitt’s father.”The campaign to distort the public’s perception of Goldwater culminated in an infamous 1964 article inFact Magazine, which surveyed members of the American Psychiatric Association, or APA, on Goldwater’s mental stability, though none of the psychiatrists had personally examined the presidential candidate.TheNew York Timesreportedon the Goldwater smear:The survey, highly unscientific even by the standards of the time, was sent to 12,356 psychiatrists, of whom 2,417 responded. The results were published as a special issue: “The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater.”The psychiatrists’ assessment was brutal. Half of the respondents judged Mr. Goldwater psychologically unfit to be president. They used terms like “megalomaniac,” “paranoid,” and “grosslypsychotic,” and some even offered specific diagnoses, includingschizophreniaandnarcissistic personality disorder.Only 27 percent of the respondents said Mr. Goldwater was mentally fit, and 23 percent said they didn’t know enough about him to make a judgment.TheFactarticle seriously damaged Goldwater’s credibility. It also led to the APA’s so-called Goldwater Rule, which forbids psychiatrists from commenting on someone’s mental status unless they first carry out an examination and the doctor is authorized by the patient to speak to the public.Despite that ethical standard, slogans similar to the Goldwater smears are being tossed around by medical professionals to describe Trump’s own mental health and his impact on the electorate.On March 2, theHouston Chronicleran a story titled, “What psychiatrists make of Donald Trump,” concluding that he suffers from narcissistic personality disorder.The newspaperclaimed:According to mental-health professionals, Trump’s behavior exemplifies the traits that historically defined the disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, psychiatry’s bible — grandiosity; an expectation that others will recognize one’s superiority; a lack of empathy. (The disorder was removed from the most recent DSM edition.)TheChroniclepiece was largely based on aVanity Fairstory glaringlytitled, “Is Donald Trump Actually a Narcissist? Therapists Weigh In!”For mental-health professionals, Donald Trump is at once easily diagnosed but slightly confounding. “Remarkably narcissistic,” said developmental psychologist Howard Gardner, a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education. “Textbook narcissistic personality disorder,” echoed clinical psychologist Ben Michaelis. “He’s so classic that I’m archiving video clips of him to use in workshops because there’s no better example of his characteristics,” said clinical psychologist George Simon, who conducts lectures and seminars on manipulative behavior. “Otherwise, I would have had to hire actors and write vignettes. He’s like a dream come true.”Last week, theWashington Postran a scarepiececlaiming “Psychologists and massage therapists are reporting ‘Trump anxiety’ among clients.” The article received a significant amount of news media attention.Judith Schweiger Levy, a psychologist on the Upper East Side, told the newspaper that “part of the reason he makes people so anxious is that he has no anxiety himself. It’s frightening. I’m starting to feel anxious just talking about him.”ThePostcited another psychologist, Paul Saks, who practices in Greenwich Village, claiming that reports linking Trump to David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, had worried a patient who is the grandson of Holocaust survivors.KKKThe David Duke fiasco began with news media claims that the former KKK grand wizard had endorsed Trump. In fact, Duke did not make an official endorsement. In 2015, Duke called Trump the “best of the lot.” After the media reported he had endorsed Trump, Dukewroteon his website, “The Zio Media Lies: I have not endorsed Donald Trump!”Duke hasstatedhe cannot endorse Trump because of the candidate’s support for Israel.Last month, Dukeexpressedsupport for Trump, although his sentiments were still shy of a formal endorsement. “Voting for these people, voting against Donald Trump at this point, is really treason to your heritage,” Duke stated on his radio show.Trump has disavowed Duke’s support numerous times, but has still faced media scrutiny because of a CNN interview in which Trump explained he didn’t know about the Duke “endorsement” and therefore couldn’t officially respond. The media has since cited the CNN interview to claim that Trump hesitated to disavow Duke’s so-called endorsement.“Just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK?”statedTrump on CNN’sState of the Union.“I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,” Trump said. “So I don’t know. I don’t know — did he endorse me, or what’s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.”Attempting to connect Trump to the KKK seems to come straight out of the anti-Goldwater playbook.One infamousattack adreleased by Goldwater’s opponent Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign was called “KKK for Goldwater.” It portrayed Goldwater as racist because Alabama KKK leader Robert Creel had expressed support for him.Like Duke’s unsolicited expressions of support for Trump, Creel had urged his supporters to become active and vote for Goldwater.TheNew York Herald TribuneNews ServicequotedCreel saying:Barry Goldwater is going to be elected. I like Barry Goldwater. I believe what he believes in. I think the same way he thinks. So does George Wallace. But he is only one man, and he can only do so much. They need our help.Despite Goldwater’s denunciations of Creel, the KKK leader’s support went on to haunt the candidate throughout the 1964 campaign. It evenresultedin some Republicans attacking Goldwater, including Baltimore Mayor T. R. McKeldin, who used the KKK’s satisfaction with Goldwater to issue a statement saying, “The greatest shame in the proud history of the Republican party is that racists now find such hope under our banner.”HitlerThe comparisons of Trump to Hitler, meanwhile, reached a fevered pitch after two former Mexican presidents, Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon,slammedTrump’s rhetoric against illegal immigration as “racist” and claimed the GOP front-runner is evoking Hitler.A Google search of mainstream news articles containing the names “Trump” and “Hitler” brings up hundreds of pieces.On Tuesday, theJerusalem Postfeaturedan article documenting nine recent times Trump has been compared to Hitler by public personalities, citing remarks by comedian Louie C.K., radio host Glenn Beck, HBO provocateur Bill Maher, and the ladies of ABC’sThe View, among others.On social media, Trump haters have beendistributinga photo from a Trump rally in Orlando that shows attendees raising their hands in what opponents call a Nazi salute. In fact, Trump had asked the crowd to raise their hand and pledge to vote for him in the Florida primary.Goldwater’s critics frequently compared him to Hitler.Jetmagazineannouncedon July 30, 1964, “Barry Goldwater’s Rise is Compared to Rise of Hitler.”Just prior to the election, union leader George Meany drew attention forcomparingGoldwater to the Nazi dictator.FrontPageMagnotednumerous other Goldwater-Hitler smears:Too many union leaders to count accused Goldwater of Hitlerism and compared him to Hitler and Mussolini. When Nazis supporting George Lincoln Rockwell heckled Goldwater, the media claimed that Goldwater supporters had sent the Nazis to heckle Goldwater.MLK claimed that, “We see danger signs of Hitlerism in the candidacy of Mr. Goldwater.” Also Khrushchev compared the Republican convention where Goldwater was nominated to a Nazi rally.Mayor Jack Shelley of San Francisco claimed that Goldwater strategists got all their ideas fromMein Kampf. Roy Wilkins of the NAACP said, “Those who say that the doctrine of ultra-conservatism offers no menace should remember that a man come out of the beer halls of Munich and rallied the forces of rightism in Germany. All the same elements are there in San Francisco now.”Like Mexico’s leaders with Trump, Soviet Premier Khrushchev in 1964 also compared Goldwater to Hitler.The APreportedon July 23, 1964:Khrushchev told a Polish audience that the candidate put forward by the Republican party “made it clear that he wants to enter the White House under the slogans of unbridled anti-communism and war threats.”He also asserted that the Republican platform, which he denounced as warlike, had been adopted “in an atmosphere reminiscent of the fascist gatherings in Nuremberg.”NukesTrump’s sanity, meanwhile, was called into question by Sen. Marco Rubio, who last monthslammedTrump as “a lunatic trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons in America.”Last week, CNN featured an opinionpieceby anti-Trump author Michael D’Antonio titled, “President Trump: A 6-year-old with nuclear weapons?”Salon ran an articleheadlined, “Donald Trump could get the nuclear codes: How anti-intellectualism is killing American democracy.”Perhaps unwittingly, this rhetoric echoes the “Daisy Girl” ad against Goldwater, recentlydubbedbyUSA Todayas “the most famous, or notorious, political attack ad in U.S. history.”In the television ad, considered important to Lyndon B. Johnson’s victory, Johnson’s campaign simulated a nuclear attack on a little girl who is depicted standing in a meadow with a flower in her hand while birds are chirping in the background. The clear implication was that Goldwater could not be trusted with U.S. national security and would bring about a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.World leaders warnBesides the harsh, anti-Trump rhetoric from Mexico’s former presidents, there have been reports of unnamed foreign diplomats warning against a Trump presidency, some using the Hitler analogy.One article that made waves was aReuterspieceon Monday that cited three unnamed U.S. officials who claimed to be quoting unnamed foreign diplomats as expressing alarm “to U.S. government officials about what they say are inflammatory and insulting public statements” by Trump.Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia have complained in recent private conversations, mostly about the xenophobic nature of Trump’s statements, said three U.S. officials, who all declined to be identified.“As the [Trump] rhetoric has continued, and in some cases amped up, so too have concerns by certain leaders around the world,” said one of the officials.The three officials declined to disclose a full list of countries whose diplomats have complained, but two said they included India, South Korea, Japan, and Mexico.James Thurber, a historian who studies U.S. presidents at American University in Washington,toldUSA Todaythat such reaction from world leaders is unprecedented.Perhaps Thurber should study the reaction from world leaders cited anonymously by the news media in 1964 regarding Goldwater.TheAssociated Pressran a scare piece in July 1964 quoting foreign news media outlets as well as unnamed foreign officials warning against a Goldwater presidency.The APreported:The Moscow newspaperSovetsakaya Rossiyadeclared that Goldwater was backed by a coalition “consisting of the most aggressive capitalist groups, racists, trade union opponents, crusaders of anti-Communism, and Ku Klux Klanners.” …In Paris, the left leaningCombatdescribed Goldwater as “an irresponsible prospect for president who risks blowing up the world, blowing up Europe, blowing up his own country.”Reaction in conservative, strongly anti-Communist Spain was mixed.Several Spanish government officials expressed delight at the nomination.“Now,” said one, “we will see a real live, hard hitting campaign in the United States.”Italians heard the news only over the government radio network since all their newspapers are closed by a strike of non-editorial workers.In Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist newspaperCommercial Dailydescribed Goldwater as an extremist backed by the John Birch Society, the Ku Klux Klan, and Fascists.The AP followed up with anotherpiececiting more unnamed diplomats fearing Goldwater’s foreign policies:Misgivings about Goldwater and his publicized views on diplomatic and military policies were expressed in Cairo where African leaders were gathered for a continental summit conference. Some expressed fear that Goldwater could force the United States back to isolation and impede East-West rapprochement.In India, spokesmen for some political parties viewed Goldwater’s victory as hardly a happy sign for easing world tensions.

Now, as our last speaker pointed out, just last year 24 states — 24 states — introduced or enacted at least 70 bills to make it harder for people to vote. They now use the voter ID laws like the poll taxes used to be used. Simply designed to keep people from being able to vote. We saw it in Georgia, in the governor’s race. We saw it in Florida. We saw it in other parts of the country. 2017. These guys never give up. We knew that. They never will give up. It’s like cutting grass, man. You cut it, it looks nice. But you let it go for awhile, it gets a little ugly, and it grows into a forest again. We can’t let this happen.WATCH:Biden’s address came on Martin Luther King Day. He linked King’s murder to what he said were “forces of hate” among “white supremacists”courted by Trump:Fifty years later, the hate that cut your dad down is still nurtured by those forces of darkness. We saw it in Charlottesville, those Klansmen and white supremacists literally — and neo-Nazis — slunked out of their dark rooms and digital hideaways, their crazed and vicious faces literally contorted, illuminated by torchlight. You couldn’t make up a Hollywood movie like that in a historic city and confronted by decent honorable Americans who said, “This is not us.”Dr. King knew those faces well, those same lost souls who once stood like cowards, hooded behind burning crosses. They haveThey have been deliberately reawakened again, those forces. It’s not an accident. They have been deliberately reawakened again. Unearthed by loose talk, by direct appeals to prejudice, from the alt-right. Then, something I never thought I’d live to see again, having a President of the United States make a moral equivalence between those who were spreading the hate and those who were opposing it, saying there were — quote — very fine people on both sides. No president since the Civil War had ever, ever, ever uttered words like that.One thing we know for certain. We learned it over and over again through history — in the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Silence is complicity.And so we have to do what you’ve been doing, what everybody’s been doing in this room for a long time. We have to speak out. We have to challenge these forces of hate.In December of 2018, Bidensaid, “Anyone from the Democrats can beat [Donald Trump in 2020].”Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter@rkraychik."

6817098047,https://www.breitbart.com/news/fda-approves-new-pill-to-reduce-pain-from-endometriosis/,FDA approves new pill to reduce pain from endometriosis,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — A new treatment for pain caused by endometriosis was approved Tuesday by U.S. regulators.The common condition involves abnormal tissue growth from the uterus that can cause severe pain and infertility.Drugmaker Abbvie said the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, Orilissa, for pain during menstruation and intercourse and at other times. Abbvie says it’s the first new pill for endometriosis in a decade.In testing, it significantly reduced menstrual pain in about 45 percent of women given a low dose and 75 percent given a high dose, compared to about 20 percent of women given dummy pills. Reduction of pain outside menstruation was slightly lower.The drug works by reducing production of the hormone estrogen. That caused side effects in some participants, including hot flashes, headaches and bone thinning.Orilissa will cost $845 every four weeks, without insurance.An estimated 1 in 10 women of reproductive age has endometriosis. Treatment usually begins with over-the-counter pain relievers, opioid painkillers and birth control pills. Other options include injections of hormone-suppressing drugs, which have significant side effects, and surgery.The new pill provides more flexible dosing in lowering estrogen levels, according to Dr. Hugh Taylor of Yale-New Haven Hospital. A consultant to AbbVie, he helped lead key studies of Orilissa.___Follow Linda A. Johnson at https://twitter.com/LindaJ_onPharma"

Who is this Mexican actress best known for her television role as the female counterpart to Guzmán?Kate del Castillo was born in Mexico City in 1972 to parents Kate Trillo and Eric del Castillo, an actor who started out in theater in the 1950s and later moved into film and television. He has appeared in roughly 300 films and over 45 Spanish-language soap operas known as telenovelas. Following in her father’s footsteps, she began acting at the tender age of six in a film calledThe Last Escape.However, she started to become more well known with her role inMuchachitasin 1991, a telenovela broadcast in several Latin American countries. Her breakout role occurred in 2007’sUnder the Same Moon, which earned del Castillo a Best Actress nod at the 2008 Imagen Awards. She has since starred in numerous plays, telenovelas, films, and cable shows, including a six-episode arc of the acclaimed HBO series Weeds. She also appeared in three episodes of the CW network’s Jane the Virgin. Most recently, del Castillo will be starring as Mexico’s First Lady in Netflix’s second-ever Spanish-language original series,Ingobernable, some time in 2016.Little did del Castillo know how her path would intersect with that of the Western Hemisphere’s biggest drug lord when she took on the very prominent role of Teresa Mendoza, the most powerful drug trafficker in southern Spain in the telenovelaLa Reina del Sur. The short-form drama was the most expensive ever produced by network Telemundo, but it is also the most successful. She also has activist roots, having been appointed Ambassador for the Mexican Commission on Human Rights to combat human trafficking in 2009. The actress has also partnered with the Humane Society of the United States to speak out against puppy mills in America.Despite her slowly increasing media presence in the U.S. in recent years, del Castillo has been largely unknown north of the border. Yet, she has ruffled many feathers in political circles in Mexico in years past. In January 2012, she published a letter on her Twitter account in which she praised El Chapo and condemned most of the Mexican government’s institutions. According to theLos Angeles Times, she wrote:“Today I believe more in ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán than in the Governments that hide painful truths: Those who hide the cure for AIDS and cancer for their own benefit and to become richer. Mr. ‘Chapo,’ wouldn’t it be cool that you started trafficking with love? With cures for diseases, with food for the homeless children, with ALCOHOL for the retirement homes that don’t let the elderly spend the rest of the days doing whatever the f..k they want. Imagine trafficking with corrupt politicians instead of women and children who end up as slaves. Why don’t you burn all those whore houses where women are worth less than a pack of cigaretttes? Without offer there’s no demand. COME ON Don! You would be the HEROES of HEROES! Let’s traffic with love. YOU KNOW HOW TO. Life is a business, and the only thing hat changes is the merchandise. Don’t you agree?”The negative backlash from the Mexican people lasted for months. In an attempt to put out the flames, del Castillo appeared in a Televisa interview during which, “in a calm manner she tried to explain her feelings while she was writing her letter, although she never mentioned if she was in her right mind while she was writing it.” While the social fires may have eventually flickered out, El Chapo took notice. Some reports have said he even tried to send del Castillo flowers, but because she was always traveling, the drug lord’s bouquet never found her.However, after Guzmán’s second capture by Mexican authorities in February 2014, he started reaching out to del Castillo with an unusual request—he wanted her to be in charge of producing his biopic. According toThe New York Timessummary accountof Sean Penn’s article forRolling Stone, the actor reached out to del Castillo when he heard about her connection to Guzmán. Although del Castillo doesn’t figure very prominently in the article, it’s clear she was actively involved in the visit, making connections, and maintaining communication with El Chapo after the group left Mexico in October 2015.Now, del Castillo is under investigation by the Mexican government, which is itching to know more details about the location where she and Penn met with Guzmán and his entourage. There are also many lingeringquestions about the legalityof Penn and del Castillo’s visit with the drug lord. Ultimately, she is simply a prominent Mexican actress who, by stirring social media controversy, drew the amorous attention of the world’s most famous drug trafficker and possibly brokered a lucrative Hollywood business deal.Sylvia Longmire is a border security expert and Contributing Editor for Breitbart Texas.

They were busboys and kitchen helpers and 7-Eleven clerks, and in a city where apartments rent for far more than many immigrants’ first jobs pay, the only [affordable] housing they’d been able to find was below ground.The federal government’s immigration policy deliberatelyextractslegal and illegal workers, consumers, and renters from many poor countries so they can be exploited by U.S. employers, landlords, and investors. Those migrants cluster into coastal cities, pushing up rents for migrants and Americans alike.The four authors ofthe article— Stephanie Lai, Vera Haller, Samira Sadeque, Marc Fisher — did not acknowledge the government’s delivery of migrant victims to the flood.Instead, they invited New York leaders to blame the drownings on other aspects of the federal migration problem, such as the city’s inability to enforce housing rules, or the possibility that federal migration laws might be enforced:“At least 100,000 people — and there’s a strong possibility there’s a lot more — are living in those apartments,” Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Friday. “So many people who end up in the illegal basements are fearful to communicate for fear they might be evicted or, worse in their mind, deported.”But for many years, New York’s elite praised the inflow of migrants for boosting the city’swealth.TheNew York Timesposteda similar articleon September 2, which also remained silent about the federal government’s role in the drowning of migrants — and of poor Americans — in New York’s cheap basements:In one of the most expensive housing markets in the world, they have offered low-income New Yorkers, including many working-class families who work in restaurants and hotels, affordable places to live. The basement apartments also provide some extra income for small landlords, many of whom are also immigrants.…Deborah Torres, who lives on the first floor of a building in Woodside, Queens, said she heard desperate pleas from the basement apartment of three members of a family, including a toddler, as floodwaters rushed in. A powerful cascade of water prevented anyone from getting into the apartment to help — or anyone from getting out. The family did not survive.Like thePost, theNew York Timesdownplayed the poor Americans who are forced by government-engineered high rental costs to live in basement apartments. Four reporters wrote theNew York Timesarticle –Mihir Zaveri,Matthew Haag,Adam Playford,andNate Schweber.TheWashington Post‘ssecond articleon Sunday, September 5, described the economic conundrum where roughly 8 million Americans are refusing to return to their low-wage jobs:At heart, there is a massive reallocation underway in the economy that’s triggering a “Great Reassessment” of work in America from both the employer and employee perspectives. Workers are shifting where they want to work — and how. For some, this is a personal choice. The pandemic and all of the anxieties, lockdowns and time at home have changed people. Some want to work remotely forever. Others want to spend more time with family. And others want a more flexible or more meaningful career path. It’s the “you only live once” mentality on steroids. Meanwhile, companies are beefing up automation and redoing entire supply chains and office setups.…[Cindy] Lehnhoff has been helping a child care center in northern Virginia recruit more staff. Their infant room remains closed, because they don’t have enough people, and one of their veteran workers was just poached by a nearby elementary school. As she spoke with The Washington Post, Lehnhoff pored over the Indeed.com job portal. It showed more than 2,000 job posts in the Fairfax County, Va., area for child care teaching assistants. Most paid $12 to $13 an hour, a bit less than many nearby fast food restaurants and retail stores.The article has three authors — Heather Long, Alyssa Fowers,andAndrew Van Dam — but not one mention of immigration.The federal government has inflated the annual new labor supply by at least 15 percent per year since around 1995. President George W. Bushpromotedcheap migrant labor, and President Barack ObamainvitedCentral American job seekers to ask for asylum. The result was a massive inflow of cheap labor and an economic bubble of low-wage jobs.That bubble burst once President Donald Trump, the coronavirus, and federal unemployment aid slashed the supply of Americans and migrants who were willing to take the low-wage jobs.In response, companies are now raising wages and buying labor-saving machines to help employees do more work. But the employers are also demanding yet more migrants to do the low-wage work Americans refuse to do.In response, the labor bubble is being inflated again by President Joe Biden and his progressives deputies, including homeland security chief Alejandro Mayorkas.They are pulling hundreds of thousands of migrants across the union line that marks the borders of the United States.They have restarted the policy of extraction migration, and are likely to add roughly 1.6 million migrants during 2021. That global race for Americans’ jobs includes tens of thousands of Afghans, and hundreds of thousands of people from Central America, includingat least 25,000 older teenage boyswho are deemed “Unaccompanied Alien Children.”The flood of new labor allows employers to refill many of the low-wage jobs — the restaurant jobs, the subcontractors’ day-labor jobs, the meatpacking jobs, delivery jobs, the construction jobs, and many more.Bidenknowsa tight labor market is good for Americans. Judges havedirectedhim to protect Americans by barring job-seeking migrants from crossing the 50-state union’s line. Multiplepolls showhis policies are increasingly unpopular.Yet his deputies — such asimmigration zealot Mayorkas— continued to pull global migrants into the U.S. labor market, where many are happy to earn $7.50 for their hourly labor.But this big-picture macroeconomics story is hidden by theWashington Post, which prefers to miniaturize and personalize every aspect of immigration policy.Washington Postauthor Maria Sacchetti, for example, posteda third articleon Sunday that allows amnesty lobbyists to praise and flatter Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for promising to push an amnesty through Congress.But Sacchetti does not even refer to theeconomic damagedone to Americans bycompanies’ government-granted abilityto hire millions of illegal foreign workers, nor thewindfall gainsthat go to wealthy employers, investors, andcoastal cities, such as New York. Her article does not quote a single critic of cheap-labor migration.Instead, she builds her article on personal stories, such as an illegal-migrant couple that lost their low-wage jobs when the coronavirus shut down the city:“We went to bed and the city woke up paralyzed,” said Maria Mejia, who dreams of becoming a U.S. citizen and opening her own buffet-style restaurant. “But the city kept going. And who kept it going? We did. The undocumented.”But those personal stories lift the corner on the city’s welcome for low-wage, rent-paying migrants:[Mejia’s] husband returned to work at a mom-and-pop supermarket last year, but like many undocumented immigrants, he has no health insurance, no overtime pay and no vacation time. He is paid $5 an hour, six days a week. The official minimum wage in New York is $15 an hour.Another migrant, Oscar Lopez, 34, works as an “air-conditioner installer,” wrote Sacchetti. “He hadn’t returned to Mexico since he left 17 years ago. He needs the $21-an-hour job that pays his family’s expenses in both countries.”Glassdoor reports that New York’s HVAC technicians earn roughly $31 per hour.But Sacchetti does recognize that New York’s government welcomes the poor migrants who crowd into the city’s real estate market:New York has attempted to integrate undocumented immigrants, providing them legal aid, issuing them city identification cards and state driver’s licenses, and creating a $2.1 billion state fund for “excluded” workers ineligible for federal pandemic aid.Sacchetti’s guides to New York’s economic underground include both theNational TPS AllianceandMake the Road New York.Both groups are part of Mark Zuckerberg’s network ofpro-migrati0nandpro-amnestygroups that are lobbying the media and Congress to pass a reconciliation amnesty this fall.The lobbying campaign has urged Democratsto not talkabout theeconomic impactof migration, andmanipulatedcoverageby the TV networksandthe print media. The network is also funding online ads praising Schumer for promising to push the amnesty through the Senate this year.Zuckerberg’s FWD.us network ofcoastal investorsstands to gain frommore cheap labor, government-aidedconsumers, andurban renters.TheWashington Postis owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

It is an injection in the reserves of all members of the fund, providing a lot of space, a lot of space for fiscal actions” at a time when the economy stopped because of Covid, Georgieva said, adding the increase would be the largest in the IMF’s history."
1107462961,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA4MNF881,Head of Mexico's powerful teachers' union arrested,"(AP) Head of Mexico’s powerful teachers’ union arrestedBy OLGA R. RODRIGUEZAssociated PressMEXICO CITYThe head of Mexico’s powerful teachers’ union was arrested at an airport outside Mexico City Tuesday for alleged embezzlement, with federal officials accusing her using union funds to pay for plastic surgery, buy a house in San Diego and even pay her bill at Neiman Marcus.Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said that Elba Esther Gordillo, who has led the 1.5 million-member National Union of Education Workers for 23 years, was detained in Toluca on charges that she embezzled about 2 billion pesos (about $160 million) from union funds.Gordillo’s arrest marks the downfall of a colorful woman long seen as a kingmaker and power-behind-the-scenes in Mexican politics. It comes a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto signed Mexico’s most sweeping education reform in seven decades into law, seeking to change a system dominated by Gordillo in which teaching positions could be sold or inherited.“We are looking at a case in which the funds of education workers have been illegally misused, for the benefit of several people, among them Elba Esther Gordillo,” Murillo Karam said.Prosecutors say the funds were drained from union accounts and later channeled through accounts in Switzerland and Lichtenstein. They said they had detected a whopping $2.7 million in purchases at Neiman Marcus using those funds, as well as $17,000 in U.S. plastic surgery bills and the purchase of a million-dollar home in San Diego.“Between 2008 and 2012, there was systematic embezzlement of union accounts,” Murillo Karam said.Gordillo made little attempt to hide her extravagant, opulent lifestyle with designer clothing and accessories, a habit that drew heated criticism in a country where teachers are poorly paid and public education has long been considered sub-par.The overhaul of Mexico’s education system was Pena Nieto’s first major proposal since taking office Dec. 1 and was considered a political blow to Gordillo.She had organized a string of protests by teachers against the reform, which moves much of the control of the education system to the federal government from the teachers’ union. Gordillo was elected to another six-year term as union leader in October.The reform creates a system of uniform standards for teacher hiring and promotion based on merit instead of union connections. It also allows for the first census of Mexico’s education system, which Gordillo’s union has largely controlled for decades, allegedly padding the payroll with thousands of phantom teachers.So great is the union’s control that no one knows exactly how many schools, teachers or students exist in Mexico.For years, she has beaten back attacks from union dissidents, political foes and journalists who have seen her as a symbol of Mexico’s corrupt, old-style politics. Rivals have accused her of corruption, misuse of union funds and even a murder, but prosecutors who investigated never brought a charge against her.She was expelled from Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party in 2006 for supporting other parties’ candidates and the formation of her own New Alliance party.Gordillo’s arrest recalled the 1989 arrest of another once-feared union boss, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, known as “La Quina.” The longtime head of Mexico’s powerful oil workers union, Hernandez Galicia was arrested during the first months of the new administration of then-President Carlos Salinas.Like Gordillo, Hernandez Galicia’s power was believed to represent a challenge to the president, and his arrest was interpreted as an assertion of the president’s authority. He was freed from prison after Salinas de Gortari left office.In 1988, he criticized Salinas’ presidential candidacy and threatened an oil workers’ strike if Salinas privatized any part of the government oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex. On Jan. 10, 1989, _ about a month after Salinas took office _ soldiers used a bazooka to blow down the door of Hernandez’ home in the Gulf Coast city of Ciudad Madero."

Rand Paul (R-KY), a leading ally of President Donald Trump’s in the U.S. Senate, told Breitbart News exclusively in an interview in his office this week that at least six million U.S. jobs are at risk if President Trump does not pull out of the leftist Paris climate deal.Paul told Breitbart News of the Paris deal:I think it would be terrible for our country. We have the potential of losing 6 million jobs and it would cost $3 trillion. Really, I don’t think President Obama had the right to do it. He did it by himself without the approval of Congress. One of the problems we have in government is we let one person have so much power that he could do something that could cost 6 million jobs and nobody gets to vote on it—I think that’s outrageous. It kind of looks like a treaty. If it’s a treaty, it should come to the Senate and be passed. But I think President Trump has the ability and he indicated during the campaign that he wanted to get rid of and get out of the Paris accord so we hope we will. We have introduced a resolution to send it to the president to encourage him to get out of the Paris accord.President Trump promised the American people during the 2016 presidential campaign he would pull out of the Paris deal since it is a job-killer. Paul was not sure why Trump has not yet pulled out, since it would be very easy for him to do so to unleash the U.S. economy and protect jobs, but he said Senate Republicans stand ready to back up the President when he does pull out of the deal.“He has a few other things on his plate, maybe,” Paul said when asked why Trump has not yet pulled out of the Paris deal. “I don’t have an answer to that. We want to encourage him and let him know we have his back and are going to point out how terrible it is for our jobs in America.”Paul’s interview with Breitbart News on this front came asa group of 22 Senate Republicansincluding Paul and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote to President Trump this week urging him to pull the United States out of the job-crushing Paris climate deal. In the letter, they detail how the institutional left—Trump’s sworn political enemies—are using the deal to gain power. Paul, in his interview with Breitbart News, adds that the deal helps benefit other countries like China at the expense of the United States—something Trump ardently campaigned against.“They say that basically we have caps to lower our emissions, but China doesn’t have to live by any caps, so that doesn’t seem very fair,” Paul said. “The caps are essentially you have to cut your industry. If you cut your industry, you cut jobs. Particularly in my state, Kentucky, the Obamas and Clintons have devastated our state already with the war on coal. We don’t need to continue that war. What we really need is to get the government out of the way so we can get back to producing energy.”Paul alsowrote an op-ed in Fox Newsabout this topic."

(AP) — Arkansas has a new supply of a lethal injection drug that expired earlier this year, a prison spokesman said Monday, clearing the way for the state to move forward with eight executions scheduled next month.Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman Solomon Graves said the state has 100 vials of potassium chloride, one of three drugs used in the state’s lethal injection protocol. The state’s previous supply of the drug had expired in January.“Coupled with the two remaining drugs, there are enough to carry out the scheduled executions,” he said.Solomon said the latest supply of the drug was received March 8 and expires at the end of August 2018. Solomon did not say where the state received the new supply, citing an Arkansas law that keeps the source of its lethal injection drugs secret.The state hasn’t executed an inmate since 2005, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson last month scheduled four sets of double executions to occur before another drug, midazolam, expires at the end of April.The state’s supply of vecuronium bromide expires on March 1, 2018.Hutchinson scheduled the executions days after the U.S. Supreme Court said it wouldn’t review a state court ruling upholding the state’s lethal injection law. Justices earlier this month rejected an effort by the inmates to block the executions, saying there was no stay in place preventing the men from being put to death.Attorneys for the inmates have asked a Pulaski County circuit judge to find the state’s lethal injection law — which keeps the names of its drug suppliers secret — and the three-drug protocol unconstitutional."
755714326,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/D9VSEP9G1,"Afghan donors meet, offer $16B in development aid","(AP) Afghan donors meet, offer $16B in development aidERIC TALMADGEAssociated PressTOKYOInternational donors pledged Sunday $16 billion in badly needed development aid for Afghanistan over the next four years when most foreign troops will leave as Afghan President Hamid Karzai urged the international community not to abandon his country.The major donors’ conference, attended by about 70 countries and organizations, is aimed at setting aid levels for the crucial period through and beyond 2014, when most NATO-led foreign combat troops will leave and the war-torn country will assume responsibility for most of its own security.“I request Afghanistan’s friends and partners to reassure the Afghan people that you will be with us,” Karzai said in his opening statement.Japanese foreign minister and U.S. officials traveling with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the donors have made $16 billion available through 2015, which would be in line with the nearly $4 billion per year that the Japanese co-hosts had said they were hoping to achieve during the one-day conference.Japan, the second-largest donor, says it will provide up to $3 billion through 2016, and Germany has announced it will keep its contribution to rebuilding and development at its current level of $536 million a year, at least until 2016.But the donors are also expected to set up review and monitoring measures to assure the aid is used for development and not wasted by corruption or mismanagement, which has been a major hurdle in putting aid projects into practice.“We have to face harsh realities filled with difficulties,'” said Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.Afghanistan has received nearly $60 billion in civilian aid since 2002. The World Bank says foreign aid makes up nearly the equivalent of the country’s gross domestic product.Foreign aid in the decade since the U.S. invasion in 2001 has led to better education and health care, with nearly 8 million children, including 3 million girls, enrolled in schools. That compares with 1 million children more than a decade ago, when girls were banned from school under the Taliban.Improved health facilities have halved child mortality and expanded basic health services to nearly 60 percent of Afghanistan population of more than 25 million, compared with less than 10 percent in 2001.But the flow of aid is expected to sharply diminish after international troops withdraw, despite the ongoing threat the country faces from the Taliban and other Islamic militants.Along with security issues, donors have become wary of widespread corruption and poor project governance. Before the conference, Japanese officials said they were seeking a mechanism to regularly review how the aid money is being spent, and guarantees from Kabul that aid would not be squandered.The U.S. portion is expected to be in the decade-long annual range of $1 billion to this year’s $2.3 billion. Officials declined to outline the future annual U.S. allotments going forward, but the Obama administration has requested a similarly high figure for next year as it draws down American troops and hands over greater authority to Afghan forces.The total amount of international civilian support represents a slight trailing off from the current annual level of around $5 billion, a number somewhat inflated by U.S. efforts to give a short-term boost to civilian reconstruction projects in Afghanistan, mirroring President Barack Obama’s decision in 2009 to ramp up military manpower in the hopes of routing the Taliban insurgency.The aid is intended nevertheless to provide a stabilizing factor as Afghanistan transitions to greater independence from international involvement.But it will come with conditions. The pledges are expected to establish a road map of accountability to ensure that Afghanistan does more to improve governance and finance management, and to safeguard the democratic process, rule of law and human rights _ especially those of women.Karzai vowed to “fight corruption with strong resolve.” But he still faces international weariness with the war and frustration over his failure to crack down on corruption.Clinton, who briefly visited the Afghan capital on Saturday before heading to Tokyo, had breakfast with Karzai and acknowledged that corruption was a “major problem.”The $4 billion in annual civilian aid comes on top of $4.1 billion in yearly assistance pledged last May at a NATO conference in Chicago to fund the Afghan National Security Forces from 2015 to 2017.."
1363096086,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA6NC7S82,3 people detained in Mexico City bar abduction,"(AP) 3 people detained in Mexico City bar abductionBy OLGA R. RODRIGUEZAssociated PressMEXICO CITYAnother young woman has been added to the list of young people apparently abducted as a group from an after-hours bar in a normally calm district of Mexico City, raising the number of missing to 12, prosecutors said Tuesday night.Chief prosecutor Rodolfo Rios also announced that two of the bar’s waiters and a woman he did not identify had been detained in the case.Rios said surveillance video showed most of the group of seven men and five women arriving at the bar together in a car and in a taxi. He wouldn’t say if there was footage showing them leaving or being abducted on a side street in the Zona Rosa entertainment district not far from the U.S. Embassy.“We’re still analyzing the footage to see how they got out of this place,” Rios said, adding that investigators were going through video from 12 surveillance cameras in the area.A man who said he escaped the mass abduction from the bar on May 26 told authorities that masked men with guns and SUVs kidnapped the group in broad daylight, just off the Paseo del Reforma, one of the city’s main avenues.The man talked to authorities when he accompanied relatives of one of the missing youths to file a report, but the man gave police a false name and address and authorities haven’t been able to locate him since then, Rios said.Rios said that the owner of the bar was being sought for questioning in the case and that authorities had searched a couple of addresses listed by him without success.Police have also searched another bar in the Roma Sur neighborhood that many of the group visited before heading to the after-hours bar that is known as Heaven After, Rios said.The bar is on a narrow street surrounded by towering office buildings a short walk from the federal police building and the U.S. Embassy.No other witnesses have reported seeing anything when the abduction supposedly happened around 10 a.m. that Sunday, a time when nearby Reforma was full of people gathering for a 5-kilometer foot race, the city’s weekly urban bike ride and an international culture fair that had just opened the day before.Rios said investigators were looking at several motives, including a dispute among drug dealers in the rough-and-tumble Tepito neighborhood, which is the center of the city’s black market.Most of the missing are from Tepito and their disappearance only came to light after their parents and other Tepito residents held a protest that blocked a major road. The fathers of two of the missing young men are suspected former Tepito crime bosses currently doing time in prison."

When one of the comedians showed up too drunk to go on, Durning took his place. He would recall years later that he was hooked as soon as heard the audience laughing.He told The Associated Press in 2008 that he had no plans to stop working. “They’re going to carry me out, if I go,” he said.Durning’s longtime agent and friend, Judith Moss, told The Associated Press that he died of natural causes in his home in the borough of Manhattan.Although he portrayed everyone from blustery public officials to comic foils to put-upon everymen, Durning may be best remembered by movie audiences for his Oscar-nominated, over-the-top role as a comically corrupt governor in 1982’s “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.”Many critics marveled that such a heavyset man could be so nimble in the film’s show-stopping song-and-dance number, not realizing Durning had been a dance instructor early in his career. Indeed, he had met his first wife, Carol, when both worked at a dance studio.The year after “Best Little Whorehouse,” Durning received another Oscar nomination, for his portrayal of a bumbling Nazi officer in Mel Brooks’ “To Be or Not to Be.” He was also nominated for a Golden Globe as the harried police lieutenant in 1975’s “Dog Day Afternoon.”He won a Golden Globe as best supporting TV actor in 1991 for his portrayal of John “Honey Fitz” Fitzgerald in the TV film “The Kennedys of Massachusetts” and a Tony in 1990 as Big Daddy in the Broadway revival of “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.”Durning had begun his career on stage, getting his first big break when theatrical producer Joseph Papp hired him for the New York Shakespeare Festival.He went on to work regularly, if fairly anonymously, through the 1960s until his breakout role as a small town mayor in the Pulitzer- and Tony Award-winning play “That Championship Season” in 1972.He quickly made an impression on movie audiences the following year as the crooked cop stalking con men Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the Oscar-winning comedy “The Sting.”Dozens of notable portrayals followed. He was the would-be suitor of Dustin Hoffman, posing as a female soap opera star in “Tootsie;” the infamous seller of frog legs in “The Muppet Movie;” and Chief Brandon in Warren Beatty’s “Dick Tracy.” He played Santa Claus in four different movies made for television and was the pope in the TV film “I Would be Called John: Pope John XXIII.”Other films included “The Front Page,” “The Hindenburg,” “Breakheart Pass,” “North Dallas Forty,” “Starting Over,” “Tough Guys,” “Home for the Holidays,” “Spy Hard” and `O Brother Where Art Thou?”Durning also did well in television as a featured performer as well as a guest star. He appeared in the short-lived series “The Cop and the Kid” (1975), “Eye to Eye” (1985) and “First Monday” (2002) as well as the four-season “Evening Shade” in the 1990s.Durning’s rugged early life provided ample material on which to base his later portrayals. He was born into an Irish family of 10 children in 1923, in Highland Falls, N.Y., a town near West Point. His father was unable to work, having lost a leg and been gassed during World War I, so his mother supported the family by washing the uniforms of West Point cadets.The younger Durning himself would barely survive World War II.He was among the first wave of U.S. soldiers to land at Normandy during the D-Day invasion and the only member of his Army unit to survive. He killed several Germans and was wounded in the leg. Later he was bayoneted by a young German soldier whom he killed with a rock. He was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and survived a massacre of prisoners.In later years, he refused to discuss the military service for which he was awarded the Silver Star and three Purple Hearts.Tragedy also stalked other members of his family. Durning was 12 when his father died, and five of his sisters lost their lives to smallpox and scarlet fever.A high school counselor told him he had no talent for art, languages or math and should learn office skills. But after seeing “King Kong” and some of James Cagney’s films, Durning knew what he wanted to do.Leaving home at 16, he worked in a munitions factory, on a slag heap and in a barbed-wire factory.Durning and his first wife had three children before divorcing in 1972. In 1974, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary Ann Amelio.He is survived by his children, Michele, Douglas and Jeannine. The family planned to have a private family service and burial at Arlington National Cemetery.___AP reporter Andrew Dalton contributed to this story."
8127460245,https://www.breitbart.com/news/german-league-issues-guidelines-on-fans-return-to-stadiums/,German league issues guidelines on fans’ return to stadiums,"Berlin (AFP) – The return of supporters to German stadiums next season took a step closer on Wednesday as the 36 clubs in the Bundesliga’s top two tiers received guidelines on how to keep spectators safe from infection amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Bundesliga season finished at the end of June with the last nine round of matches played behind closed doors.However, with clubs having lost millions in match day revenue, the German Football league (DFL) has provided help in how to create a safe environment in grounds.“The guideline serves as an orientation for the basic structure” of hygiene concepts and “contains numerous aspects to be considered,” the DFL said in a statement.Each club would need their concept approved by the local health authority.The DFL’s guide has already been submitted to the German government’s Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) for evaluation.As the league points out, the BMG says high standards of protection to prevent infection is a basic requirement before fans can return.Germany currently has around 200,000 cases and recorded 9,071 deaths due to the virus.Top clubs like champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig are reportedly already working on hygiene concepts which could see a number of fans return.Dortmund have tested a system to measure body temperatures of supporters.“I am hopeful that at least a small proportion of fans will be admitted again from September,” Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said at the end of June.Union Berlin are looking into playing home games in front of a full house when the 2020/21 campaign starts in Germany on September 18.Union want club employees tested and for all 22,000 ticket holders for each home game to produce a negative test for COVID-19 within 24 hours of kick-off.However, Union’s plans have already been criticised and a leading virologist dubbed it “irresponsible”.“Until we have a vaccine, there won’t be a full stadium,” Ulf Dittmer, director of virology at the University Hospital in Essen told newspaper WAZ.Dittmer worries despite a negative test, someone could still be “infectious one day later in the stadium” and spread the virus on packed terraces."

Her parents lived at Scientology compounds in the United States, and church officials wanted Tina to come join them by using anR-1 visa— a permit recently created by Congress for religious workers, good for five years. The officials told Tina (a pseudonym) what to tell anyone who asked: that she would be attending a specialScientology schooland volunteering for the church part time. It wasn’t true. Once approved, Tina worked shifts as long as 24 hours doing construction, building furniture, and performing administrative tasks. “None of it’s voluntary,” she told me.The Scientology organization is nowbeing suedby some of the workers.For decades, the federal government has quietly supported massive labor trafficking by criminal gangs, companies, and supposedly non-profit organizations. The government’s supportive policy — dubbed “Extraction Migration” — has cut wages for millions of Americans and raised their housing costs while fattening company profits and Wall Street stock values.Much of the labor trafficking is camouflaged by the asylum programs for poor southern migrants. In February 2022, the Department of Justice convicted five members of afamily-run Latino sex trafficking organizationthat operatedbetween 2006 and 2017.The trafficking is also hidden among the many “temporary” visa worker programs that supposedly allow employers to overcome claimed “labor shortages” in an economy of more than 165 million employees. These visa programs keep a foreign workforce of atleast 2 million people in U.S. jobs, includingat least 1.5 millionforeign workers in white-collar jobs.Other companies import legally import people onB-1/B-2 tourist visasand put lease them to other businesses under the shared pretense that they are temporary legal visa workers. This August, federal officialsfinally jailed a Ukrainianwho was part of a gang that trafficked illegal workers to Florida’s Key West since 2007.Organizations that claim religious status use visa laws to smuggle in cheap workers. In 2021, federal officials shut down a labor trafficking scheme by a Hindu sect that usedR-1 visasfor religious workers to import lower-caste Dalit workers so theycould be used illegallyto build temples in the United States.In the Scientology case, the imported workers were allowed to the United States enter after they got R-1 visas for religious workers. The visas were awarded at U.S. embassies in Europe and elsewhere.“This is an entirely predictable and almost guaranteed result — and that’s why Congress should just get rid of the program,” said Jessica Vaughan, the Director of Policy Studies for theCenter for Immigration Studies.She added:Managers in agencies want these visas rubber-stamped without too many questions because they are susceptible to pressure from the employer groups, and because they are in denial about the abuse of these programs that can occur.Moreover, “there’s no reason to have this category — if bona fide religious institutions need workers, they should be able to apply through other [visa worker] programs — they’re nonprofits and are not subject to any cap,” Vaughan said, adding “There’s no shortage of people who could work as church secretaries.”Federal officials have done little to curb the labor inflow to the Scientology groups, Dugan wrote:This [federal] blind spot even seems to extend to law enforcement. In 2018, Serge Gil met with investigators at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles to discuss human trafficking. He hasn’t heard anything since. The same year, Mike Rinder says, he met with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Tampa Bay to raise similar concerns. He also doesn’t know if investigators have acted on his information.The labor extraction process is protected by lobbyists and legislators.The NYMag.com article also quotesa November 2021 letterby GOP Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) objecting to the reduced inflow of R-1 workers —  partly due to the 9/11 atrocity, but also because of increased scrutiny of theR-1 visasunder President Donald Trump. The letter was sent to Alejandro Mayorkas, a pro-migration zealot who is President Joe Biden’s border chief:There are many more religious workers waiting outside of the United States, unable to serve in our communities. These challenges have been compounded by COVID-19- related suspensions of visa services at U.S. embassies and consulates around the world in 2020 and 2021, resulting in lengthy visa processing wait times for religious workers seeking to complete consular processing abroad.The Collins letter includeda wish list from 17 religious groups, including the Scientologists as well as Jewish, Christian, and Muslim groups.One of Biden’s pro-migration deputies responded to Collins in February, promising faster processing and reduced fraud checks:USCIS has reallocated personnel to address the backlog of religious worker petitions and worked with its Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate to arrange for the waiver of the pre-adjudication verification site visit requirement for certain petitioners that have demonstrated a history of compliance with that program.But thelong-understood problemsin the R-1 program are obscured by business lobbies that use other visa programs, Vaughan said.“All of these cheap labor employers will defend each other, whether it’s the Catholic church, big tech, or big agriculture,” she said.The NYMag.com article includes a denial from the church:Karin Pouw, a spokesperson for Scientology, said by email that the organization “strictly complies with U.S. immigration policies” and “works directly with immigration counsel to ensure compliance with the immigration policies and regulations of the United States.” She added that my sources were liars engaged in a “coordinated and premeditated conspiracy to level false allegations.”Extraction MigrationIt is easier for government officials to grow the economy by importing people than by growing exports, productivity, or the birth rate.So the federal government officially — and unofficially — extracts millions of migrants from poor countries and uses them as extra workers, consumers, and renters.This extraction migration policy both grows and skews the national economy — but it prevents tight labor markets, and so itshiftsvast wealth from ordinary people toinvestors,billionaires, andWall Street.Itmakesit difficult for ordinary Americans toadvancein their careers,getmarried,raisefamilies, orbuyhomes.Extraction migrationslowsinnovation andshrinksAmericans’productivity, partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices byusingstoop labor anddisposable workersinstead of the American professionals and productivity-boostingtechnologythat would allow Americans and their communities to earn more money.This migration policy also reduces exports byminimizingshareholder pressure on U.S. companies tobuild upbeneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries.Migrationunderminesemployees’ workplace rights, and itwidensthe regional economic gaps between the Democrats’ cheap-labor coastal states and the Republicans’Heartlandandsouthernstates.An economy fueled by extraction migration alsodrainsAmericans’ political clout over elites,alienatesyoung people, andradicalizesAmericans’ democratic civicculturebecause itgivesan excuse for wealthy elites and progressives toignoreweak Americans at the bottom of society, such as drug addicts.This economic strategy is enthusiastically pushed by progressives who wish to transform the U.S. from a society governed by European-origin civic culture into an economic empire of jealous identity groups overseen by progressive hall monitors. “We’re trying to become the first multiracial, multi-ethnic superpower in the world,” Rep.

7351355189,https://www.breitbart.com/news/woman-who-alleged-rape-by-ex-msu-players-speaks-publicly/,Woman who alleged rape by ex-MSU players speaks publicly,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan State University student who sued the school after alleging three former men’s basketball players gang-raped her in 2015 said at a news conference Thursday that she wants to encourage other “silent survivors” of sexual assault to tell their stories.Bailey Kowalski, 22, who will graduate in May with a biology degree, held the news conference on the fourth anniversary of the alleged incident. She spoke a day after going public for the first time in a story published by The New York Times.“This isn’t a burden they have to carry on their own,” she said of other rape victims, as her parents, brother and lawyer looked on inside a hotel meeting room near the East Lansing campus. Kowalksi teared up as she said her decision to file the lawsuit a year ago and go public now was influenced by watching victims of disgraced former university sports doctor Larry Nassar come forward.“It empowered me to do it,” she said.The suit, in which Kowalski is listed as Jane Doe, says she was 18 on April 12, 2015, when she met the players at an East Lansing bar about a week after the team lost in the Final Four. She was later taken to an off-campus apartment where the players took turns raping her in a bedroom, according to the complaint.She caught a taxi back to her dorm room and contacted university counseling center staff about a week later. After telling a counselor that basketball players were involved, she said the staff discouraged her from notifying the police.“I was intimidated, and I was told that I was going to be swimming with some really big fish,” Kowalski said Thursday. “I’ll never forget that phrase and the immediate feeling of despair and isolation.”The suit, amended in December, points to past alleged sexual assaults involving MSU athletes, including two separate 2010 incidents in which a total five basketball players allegedly raped women and were not charged or disciplined. It alleges the university violated Title IX requirements and Kowalski’s rights by failing to follow normal reporting and investigative procedures when athletes were involved, actively discouraging victims from filing reports and not notifying them of reporting and confidentiality options.Kowalski said she would have filed a police report if she had known she would not get into trouble for using a fake ID at the bar, and she would have had a rape kit done if not for fears that her parents’ insurance would be billed.The school declined to comment on the suit Thursday, citing the litigation, but last year said she was treated appropriately by counselors and denied that she was discouraged to file a Title IX complaint or to contact the police.The university opened a Title IX investigation after learning of the suit. The review is ongoing.“We are committed to listening to survivors who bravely tell us about their experiences so that we can improve our response and help those who seek support in the future,” university spokeswoman Emily Gerkin Guerrant said in a statement."
971391309,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA34FU5G2,Colorado River water report released in Vegas,"(AP) Colorado River water report released in VegasBy KEN RITTERAssociated PressLAS VEGASRising demand and falling supply have water managers in the arid West projecting that the Colorado River won’t be able to meet the demands over the next 50 years of a population of 40 million people and growing.Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday issued what he termed “a call to action” along with a three-year study of the river, its flows and its ability to meet the future needs of city-dwellers, Native Americans, businesses, ranchers and farmers in seven Western states.The study found the population in the West could double, while today’s drought-stricken Colorado River is expected to only recover about 85 percent of its historic flows.“We are in a troubling trajectory in the Colorado River basin, as well as the Rio Grande basin,” Salazar told reporters on a conference call outlining the math in the findings of the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.“There is no one solution that is going to meet the needs of this challenge,” Salazar said. “We need to reduce our demand through conservation. We also need to augment supply with practical measures.”The government’s top water official dismissed as politically and technically impractical some ideas in the study, including piping water from the nation’s heartland and towing Arctic icebergs south to help such thirsty U.S. cities as Denver, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix.But Salazar and Bureau of Reclamation officials warned that the Colorado River’s historical 15 million acre-feet per year flow has been reduced by 12 years of drought to about 12 million acre-feet. Officials say an acre-foot can meet the water needs of up two families per year.The study projects that by 2060 the river flow could be 3.2 million to 8 million acre-feet short of regional needs.Water interests and the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming together lay claim to all the water in the river and then some.Mexico also has a stake in the river, and officials last month set new rules to share Colorado River water south of the border and let Mexico store water in Lake Mead near Las Vegas.A “very believable estimate” using climate change scenarios projects the river flow increasing to just 13.7 million acre-feet per year by 2060, said Kay Brothers, a former Southern Nevada Water Authority executive in Las Vegas who co-managed the study.“We’re going to have problems in the future meeting the demands of the Colorado River basin,” Brothers said. “We have to begin now starting to put measures in place to meet the imbalance and prepare for a drier future.”Even before the report was released, some advocates criticized it as a “fundamentally flawed,” and based on inflated projections of the amount of water in the river and the number of people in the region.“States cooked the books to show higher demand for water consumption to set up a federal bailout on expensive water projects,” said Molly Mugglestone, director of the advocacy group Protect the Flows.But Anne Castle, assistant Interior secretary for water and science, said the data came from the best experts, science information available. And Carly Jerla, a federal Bureau of Reclamation analyst, told reporters the range of future growth scenarios went from a small increase to doubling the regional population.Another advocacy group, the Environmental Defense Fund, was measured in its assessment.“The Colorado River is the lifeblood of the dry West,” said Dan Grossman, an official with the Boulder, Colo.-based organization. “We can’t keep bleeding the river dry. The basin study says loud and clear that it’s time for a new approach that puts conservation first.”The report considered almost 160 suggestions, Brothers said.Salazar bluntly dismissed proposals like a multi-billion dollar pipeline running some 670 miles from the Missouri River to Colorado.But he left open the discussion about options ranging from eliminating thirsty invasive but prolific plants like tamarisk, capping reservoirs and irrigation canals to reduce evaporation, and desalting seawater.Salazar noted that the federal government already operates a desalination plant near Yuma, Ariz., to treat saline agricultural irrigation water as it returns to the river.The report also cites the possibility of entities increasing cooperation to swap water credits and “bank” the valuable resource.Advocates on all sides seized on elements of the 163-page report to bolster their positions.Boulder, Colo.-based Western Resource Advocates said the study should quickly spur states “to press the `go’ button” on conservation, reuse and efficiency measures.Denver-area water chief Jim Lochhead issued a statement urging a go-slow approach.“While this is a critical issue for Colorado, we have time to approach solutions thoughtfully,” he said.In Wyoming, the Family Farm Alliance pointed to the implications for food production in study estimates that irrigated acreage in the Colorado River basin will decrease by 2060.“Policy makers and Colorado River stakeholders must understand the critical implications of taking 6 to 15 percent of existing irrigated agriculture out of production,” alliance President Patrick O’Toole said.Matt Niemerski, with the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group American Rivers, said climate change and population growth in the region make status-quo management of Colorado River water resources “untenable.”“This is the start of the conversation,” Niemerski said, “about how the tens of millions of people who depend on the river for water are ultimately going to be able to live there.”"

Trump, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer said of President Trump‘s inaugural address that, “They’re quaking in their boots in foreign capitals.”Krauthammer said, “I wanted to make a point about the speech. A part that we overlooked but I am sure is not being overlooked around the world. There are two audiences obviously for inaugural address—domestic and foreign. I guarantee you that they are quaking in their boots in foreign capitals, particularly of our allies and trading partners. The way that Trump spoke about the outside world was the most aggressive, most sort of hyper nationalist and in some ways, most hostile of any inaugural address I think since the second World War. What Trump pointed out, what he drew was a picture of a zero-sum world where what we’ve done for the world, they have been stealing from us. He says for decades we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of our American industry, subsidized others’ military at the expense of the weakening of our army.”“We’ve made others rich while becoming poor. Then this scattering sense that the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed around the world. In other words, the other guys, “the other,” including friends. Kennedy spoke harshly about the communist world. This is about our allies,” he continued.“They have been stealing from us, our corrupt ruling class has taken the money of the middle-class and sent it around the world. That is the exaggerated anti-globalist view. I can understand a lot of the sentiments, but imagine how this has been heard in East Asia, in Europe, in other places, and then he ends up with a phrase that may not be as a resonant here, he says we are going to have one principle, “America First.” It is capitalized in the version that you get printed out, and capitalized in the name of the isolationist party from the 1930s that fought to keep us out of any entanglements abroad, i.e., out of the second World War, led by Charles Lindbergh and others that dismantled a week after Pearl Harbor. For many people around the world, the British in particular, that is quite a resonant phrase, and it says to them, to the free world, since Harry Truman and Eisenhower, we constructed a world where we carried a lot of you—economically, militarily, etc. That game is over, you are on your own. That is an amazing message for an inaugural address.  We heard it on the campaign, but that is policy now and it’s going to have a huge effect around the world.”(h/tMediaite)Follow Pam Key on Twitter@pamkeyNEN59"

AsPravdareports,   Muslim dating websites in the country include “Married, looking for another wife” as a category.   But advocates of polygamy include ethnic Russians, too.   Ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky has “repeatedly called for polygamy in Russia.” He even introduced a bill in parliament to allow up to 4 wives. (The bill was rejected.)   Proponents argue that there are approximately 11 million more women than men in Russia, so polygamy will allow more women to marry and it will help boost Russia’s birthrate. Russia’s population is actually declining. Polygamy, they claim,   would reverse it.But the article points out the harsh reality for Russia polygamists.   In Russia’s polygamous families,   the men only bring in about 1/3 of the income.   They marry extra wives….and put them to work!   “Many men did not remember the names of all their children, they did not recognize them in person, and, when meeting them, asked: ‘Which mother are you from?”   And the kicker?   “Today quite a few Russian men do not bother themselves with hard work, preferring to live off financially secure wives. In the event of formal recognition of polygamy, when these men have three or four bread winners, ‘they will simply perch themselves on the sofa and lit up a hookah.'”One poll found that over 60 percent or Russians still reject polygamy.   They better look elsewhere to reverse their decline."

But it pales in comparison to the lies, illegal gun sales, weapons trafficking, and wholesale slaughter of innocents we’ve seen as a result of Fast and Furious.Think about it — Watergate was a break-in, the goal of which was secure some “dirt” on Democrats to help Richard Nixon during his re-election bid in 1972. Nixon, the man vilified for it, didn’t even know about it until after the break-in had already happened, and his crime was covering it up once he learned of it.He had to resign to avoid being impeached for covering up a break-in in which no one was physically harmed.Now, jump to 2009 and the launch of operation Fast and Furious under President Barack Obama; 2,500 guns were sold to criminals or to straw purchasers who knowingly intended to pass the guns to criminals. Background checks for the purchasers were done away with and in some cases, the money to buy the guns was supplied at taxpayers’ expense.Because of this, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) has relayed tales of individuals on food stamps coming into a gun store in the Phoenix area with brown bags full of money and purchasinghundredsof guns.The vast majority of these guns were then smuggled across the U.S./Mexico border while the ATF and DOJ looked the other way, ostensibly hoping the guns would be passed to Mexican cartel members so the U.S. government could make arrests.For the record, we’re still waiting on those arrests.Over a year after Fast and Furious began, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned down by men armed with Fast and Furious weapons on the southwest border, and hundreds of Mexican citizens have been killed with weapons smuggled into Mexico during the operation.Moreover, early on in the operation (January 30, 2010),14 teenagersat a birthday party near Juarez were massacred by men armed with Fast and Furious weapons.And at every turn in the road, as Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) have tried to investigate Fast and Furious, there have been cover-ups, changes in testimony, and withheld evidence.The bottom line — Watergate was less than child’s play compared to Fast and Furious.Nixon liedbut hundreds have diedunder Obama and Eric Holder."

The findings were published Wednesday in Neuron.The researchers specifically looked at how neurons signal each other and convey messages through synapses in eight mice.“We’re now able to see how astrocytes and synapses make physical contact, and determine how these connections change in disorders like Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease,” lead author Baljit Khakh, a professor of physiology and neurobiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said in a press release. “What we learn could open up new strategies for treating those diseases, for example, by identifying cellular interactions that support normal brain function.”Khakh’s team had different colors of light pass through a lens to magnify objects that are far smaller than those viewable by earlier techniques. In the mice, they observed how interactions between synapses and astrocytes change over time, including differently for various diseases.Previously, neuroscientists weren’t able to measure how astrocytes’ tentacles interact with synapses to perform important brain functions.“This new tool makes possible experiments that we have been wanting to perform for many years,” Khakh said. “For example, we can now observe how brain damage alters the way that astrocytes interact with neurons and develop strategies to address these changes.”Researchers still haven’t determined how often astrocytes make contact and how they change during disease, or if it’s a result of different types of cellular activity.“We know that astrocytes play a major role in how the brain works and also influence disease,” said Chris Octeau, a postdoctoral fellow of physiology in Khakh’s lab. “But exactly how the cells accomplish these tasks has remained murky.”"

Why should I wear something not dictated by my religion?” she said in an interview.Christians make up nearly 4 percent of the country’s 6 million population.Bank spokeswoman Eman Affaneh confirmed that Salameh was fired because “she refused to comply with the terms of her contract, which stipulates that all employees must respect management regulations and bank bylaws.”“We are an Islamic establishment and the dress code is a reflection of our conservative Muslim traditions and values,” she said.Salameh says she had worked for Jordan’s Industrial Development Bank for 25 years until it was acquired in 2010 by the Jordan Dubai Islamic Bank _ an offshoot of the Dubai Islamic Bank based in the United Arab Emirates. In January 2011, the new management issued a new regulation stipulating a unified dress code for its workers, including waist-to-heel skirts and head covers for female employees.Salameh accepted the uniform, but refused to wear the head cover on grounds that it violated her religious beliefs and since the contract she signed when she was hired did not oblige her to a dress code.Affaneh, the spokeswoman, said the headcover “is a fashionable piece of white cloth that shows the hair line _ like what women wear in the Gulf Arab countries.”“It’s not a headscarf, covering all the hair,” she added.She and Salameh said that five other Christian women employees at the bank accepted wearing the headcover.When Salameh refused the head cover, “no action was taken against me for nearly 17 months until two weeks ago, when I was suddenly given two notices, five days apart, warning me that I will lose my job if I don’t wear the head cover,” she said.“When I stuck by my decision, I was verbally fired last Sunday,” she said, adding that she filed a lawsuit against the bank.The next legal step would be for the court to decide when it would hear the case.Affaneh, the spokeswoman, says the bank has not been notified of the lawsuit.“Her contract allows her to do what she wants,” she said. She declined to discuss the matter further."

4686290923,http://www.breitbart.com/news/refugees-from-burundi-flow-into-rwanda-as-tensions-mount/,Refugees from Burundi flow into Rwanda as tensions mount,"GASHORA, Rwanda (AP) — More than 10,000 people from the East African nation of Burundi have crossed into neighboring Rwanda amid threats of violence ahead of elections, with many arriving here saying they have been intimidated by thugs who support President Pierre Nkurunziza who may seek a third term.An average of 360 people are arriving every day. Many refugees say they fear attacks from a group known as Imbonerakure, a youth group loyal to Nkurunziza’s ruling party, known by its initials as the CNDD-FDD.“They have been armed and are ready to harm or at worst kill anyone who doesn’t support CNDD-FDD,” Jean de Dieu Niyibizi, 27, one of the refugees who crossed to Rwanda.Appearing frail after many hours of walking, Niyibizi said that he and others trekked for two days before they got an entry point to enter Rwanda after they reported the threats to local authorities and no action was taken. The refugees say the government has put armed forces along border points to prevent people from fleeing.“We had to bribe out way out because if you don’t have money they send you back,” said Niyibizi, who left behind his wife and two children. “I wanted to come and see the situation before I ask them to come.”Last week, Burundi’s president said that citizens were fleeing from no particular threat but from hunger.The CNDD-FDD is set to convene a congress on Saturday to decide whether it will field Nkurunziza or get a new candidate in the June 26 presidential elections. The international community has warned that attempts to violate the constitution could catapult Burundi back into violence and ethnic strife.Burundi’s constitution says the president “is elected by universal direct suffrage for a mandate of five years renewable one time,” but Nkurunziza’s supporters say he is eligible to serve a third term because he was first installed as president in 2005 by parliament to lead a transitional government, and not by a popular vote. He won the 2010 election as the sole candidate. Opposition members boycotted, saying they feared it would be rigged.The flow of refugees testifies to the fear that violence that gripped the country for years until the 2003 Arusha Peace Accord could be rekindled. Burundi’s civil war had been fought mainly between Hutu rebels and a Tutsi-dominated army, and resulted in the deaths of more than 250,000 people. The Rwandan government and the U.N. refugee agency on Wednesday started relocating the refugees from the current camps near the border to another camp in Mahama, east of Kigali, Rwanda’s capital.Resistance to Nkurunziza, an ethnic Hutu, running for a third term includes members of his own party, lawmakers, the clergy, student groups and civil society.Hussein Radjabu, the former head of CNDD-FDD who fell out with Nkurunziza, on Tuesday warned that the ruling party could be planning ethnic killings and that people have already been trained and armed to carry out attacks.Presidential spokesman Willy Nyamitwe said on Thursday that Radjabu’s claims are not true."

1059633351,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA461PD83,Parents of missing Utah mom push new Wash. law,"(AP) Parents of missing Utah mom push new Wash. lawBy MIKE BAKERAssociated PressOLYMPIA, Wash.The parents of a missing Utah mother pushed Friday for changes in Washington state laws on custody cases, saying proposed legislation might have prevented the killing of their two grandchildren.Chuck and Judy Cox testified before a state Senate committee considering a bill that would restrict or block visitation rights for someone who is the subject of a murder investigation.They told lawmakers the legislation could have changed the course of the case involving their missing daughter, Susan Powell, whose husband Josh Powell killed himself and their young kids during a parental visit.“Most likely, they would have officially named Josh Powell a suspect in order to afford Charlie and Braden more protection,” Chuck Cox said, referring to the grandchildren. The grandparents had custody of the two children.Authorities in Utah had long been eyeing Josh Powell in the 2009 disappearance of his wife. Powell killed his children last year when they arrived at his home for a supervised visit.Utah investigators never publicly declared Powell a suspect but treated him as one privately.The proposed law in Washington would allow people involved in custody cases to demand information from law enforcement that might be relevant to decisions on visitation matters.Republican Sen. Pam Roach, who is sponsoring the proposed bill, said it provides more tools for judges to restrict visitation. She noted that some visitations can be limited to just once a month in a public place _ not in a private home.“We need more parameters around our current law to give us a wake-up call and bring us back to common sense,” Roach said.Rick Bartholomew, who testified on behalf of the Washington State Bar Association, said he supported the idea behind the bill but not the implementation.He expressed concern that some investigations are left open for long periods of time and ultimately lead to the exoneration of parents, which could mean parents would be separated from their kids for extended periods of time, even if they did nothing wrong.Bartholomew also said the rule requiring law enforcement to turn over details of an investigation during a custody case could harm the murder probe.The suspect in a murder case could use the tool in order to get a glimpse inside that investigation, he said.A committee of senators hearing the bill did not take a vote on the measure Friday."

That’s according to Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO), whocalledCotton “Tehran Tom”; that’s according to former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, whosaid that his activity“borders on treason;” that’s according to theNew York Daily Newsthat headlined pictures of Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Rand Paul (R-KY) with the headline “TRAITORS;” that’s according to MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, who called for Cotton’s prosecution under the never-enforced and likely unconstitutional Logan Act.What did Cotton do to earn his newfound title as traitor rather than American hero? He penned an open letter to Iran informing that regime that any deal cut with the President without Congressional approval would be alterable by Congress and revocable by future presidents. Essentially, for paraphrasing Article II of the Constitution of the United States in public, Cotton has been characterized as Benedict Arnold.But before we sign off on the bizarre notion that a Republican Senator trying to stop Iran from going nuclear is a traitor rather than the president who aims to allow Iran to loosen economic restrictions and then go nuclear, perhaps we ought to look more closely at some of the goings-on inside the Obama administration.Our current Secretary of State, John Kerry,once saidthat American soldiers had “personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war.”Our former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, hadunusually close relationswith the America-hating Muslim Brotherhood, at least according to the wife of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi. Raymond Ibrahim reports, fromEl-Mogaz News, that Morsi’s wife “is threatening to expose the special relationship between her husband and Hillary Clinton…Sources close to Nagla confirmed that she has threatened to publish the letters exchanged between Morsi and Hillary.” Judicial Watch hasattempted to uncover emailsbetween Hillary and Huma Abedin, her top aide, regarding Egypt policy. Those emails are missing, thanks to Hillary’s private server.Our president once said that American troops in Afghanistan were “just air-raiding villages and killing civilians”; as president, he has maximized Iranian power in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen while sending the Ayatollah mash notes, undercut Israel’s military position in the Middle East, rejected military aid to Egypt as it fights the Muslim Brotherhood, negotiated with the Taliban, and created a vacuum in Libya granting terrorists total power. As Joel Pollakpointed out this morning, “As more than one critic has observed, if Obama were deliberately collaborating with the enemy, his policies would hardly look different.”The Obama administration has actively aided alleged and convicted traitors to the United States. Obama infamously posed with the parents of Bowe Bergdahl, an alleged deserter and traitor, claiming that he had heroically traded five top Taliban terrorists for Bergdahl. National Security Advisor Susan Rice then claimed Bergdahl served with “honor and distinction.” That’s a far cry from the testimony of his fellow soldiers, who said they were forced to search for Bergdahl at considerable personal risk after hesimply wandered off the reservationto join up with the Taliban.Then there’sBradley Manning, the convicted traitor who turned over thousands of pages of classified documents to Wikileaks while burning Lady Gaga CDs. The Obama administration granted Manning’s request for taxpayer-funded hormone therapy so Bradley could become Chelsea, despite the fact that the Department of Defense doesn’t provide for hormone therapy for sex changes.In a nation where the president believes he has absolute power, those who question the president are the traitors. No wonder Tom Cotton is under fire.Ben Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book,The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

UNESCO head Irina Bokova said the loss represented 22% of its operating budget and caused the “worst ever” financial crisis in UNESCO’s history. Still, the agency would not budge on its recognition of “Palestine.”Instead, Bokova went to other countries for aid to make up the budget shortfall. She also asked the Obama Administration to reconsider its decision in the future.In its fiscal year 2013 budget request, Obama asked Congress for $79 million for UNESCO and to waive the defunding requirement. Congress said no, so on Wednesday Obama tried again, asking for $77.7 million for UNESCO in its FY2014 State and Foreign Operations budget proposal, presenting their request as an attempt to advance U.S. interests:The ability to make such contributions is essential to advancing U.S. interests worldwide and strengthening U.S. global leadership, influence, and credibility. While the administration remains committed to heading off any new efforts by the Palestinians to seek such membership in organizations across the U.N. system, these moves may well continue… (the defunding legislation) “runs counter to U.S. national security interests by allowing the Palestinians to isolate the United States and prevent the active U.S. engagement necessary to pursue U.S. policy objectives in international organizations… In turn, the United States would lose influence and eventually voting rights in international organizations."
7146881618,https://www.breitbart.com/news/ndsu-goes-for-7th-fcs-title-in-eastern-washingtons-return/,NDSU goes for 7th FCS title in Eastern Washington’s return,"FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Before North Dakota State made Fargo to Frisco an annual trip, Eastern Washington won the first FCS championship game played in North Texas. That was eight years ago.The Big Sky Conference champion Eagles (12-2) are finally back in the title game and aren’t surprised that on Saturday they will have to face North Dakota State (15-0), which is going for its record seventh FCS championship since then.“In the offseason thinking about getting to this point, you kind of just automatically picture it being NDSU just because it’s so normal for them to be here,” Eastern Washington linebacker Ketner Kupp said.Second-year Eastern Washington coach Aaron Best knows what his team is up against.“This is not a business trip. This is not a vacation. This is a game against North Dakota State, the No. 1 team in the nation, and we’re not OK to be here,” said Best, the team’s offensive coordinator during that 2010 championship season. “We will give them their best shot. They will give us our best shot.”North Dakota State won five titles in a row after the Eagles won their only championship 20-19 over Delaware, overcoming a 19-0 deficit after halftime in the first FCS game played in the pro soccer stadium about a half-hour north of downtown Dallas.The Missouri Valley Conference champion Bison only missed a January trip to Frisco two years ago, but returned last season and matched the six FCS (formerly Division I-AA) titles won by Georgia Southern before it moved to the FBS level.Like five years ago in Craig Bohl’s final game before he became Wyoming’s coach, the Bison will try to win a championship in Chris Klieman’s finale. Klieman (68-6), who will be Kansas State’s new coach, is going for his fourth FCS title as a head coach to match the record four won by Jim Tressel at Youngstown State before he later won a national title at Ohio State.“It doesn’t feel any different right now to be honest with you, simply because my total focus has been on preparing, preparing, preparing for Eastern Washington. And no different than last year or three years before that or however many years we’ve been here,” Klieman said. “Whether it’s my last game here or not, to me, is irrelevant. It’s just the time that you have with these seniors.”STICKING OUTFCS All-America quarterback Easton Stick is 48-3 as the NDSU starter, matching Brock Jensen for the most wins in school history. Stick was the starter for the 2017 title team and will try to join Jensen and Carson Wentz, the NDSU starter before Stick, with multiple championships. Stick has set NDSU career records with 10,897 total yards, 86 touchdowns passing and 124 total TDs. He needs 104 yards passing to break Jenson’s career record of 8,598 set from 2010-13.“I talked to Carson a little bit earlier today,” Stick said Friday. “He’s been obviously a really good friend to me since I stepped on campus here and has played a big role in our program’s success and my success. He’s continued to be a really good friend.”PAST MEETINGSOn the way to its 2010 championship, Eastern Washington had an overtime victory at home over North Dakota State in the quarterfinal round of the playoffs. There have been only two other meetings between the two teams, both regular-season games won by the Bison. NDSU won a 50-44 overtime game at home in 2016 before a 40-13 win at Eastern Washington in 2017.ANOTHER KUPPKupp, Eastern Washington’s leading tackler with 104 stops (57 solo), is the younger brother of Los Angeles Rams receiver Cooper Kupp, a standout at Eastern Washington from 2013-16. Cooper, who never got play in a title game, will be there Saturday to support his brother and alma mater.“Guys keep asking me if I give him a hard time,” Ketner Kupp said. “No, he’s just really excited that we got here and he knows the work we put in and how hard it is to get here.”FRISCO EXTENSIONThe NCAA announced Friday a five-year extension to keep the FCS championship game in Frisco through the 2024 season, with an option for at least one more year after that. The Southland Conference serves as the game’s host at the home stadium of MLS team FC Dallas, and the site of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.___More AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"

The projections were made with 44 percent of ballots counted.“The will of the people leaves no doubt what they want,” Dodik said, adding that voters “punished” his opponent for his “servile policies toward the West.”Ivanic conceded defeat, but said “it’s too early for some definitive results.”Complete official results are expected Monday.The presidency also has a Muslim and a Croat member. Dodik advocates eventual separation of Serbs from Bosnia. His election deals a blow to efforts to strengthen the country’s unity after the 1992-95 war.The general election was seen as a test of whether Bosnia would move toward integration in the European Union and NATO or remain entrenched in rivalries stemming from the war that killed 100,000 people and left millions homeless..Russian President Vladimir Putin had endorsed the openly anti-West Dodik. The United States has imposed sanctions on Dodik for actively obstructing efforts to implement the 1995 Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war.Voters in Sunday’s election filled positions in the complex governing system the peace accord created. The country consists of two regional mini-states — one Serb-run and a Muslim-Croat entity — with joint institutions in a central government. .Along with the Bosnian presidency, voters picked the Serb president and the two entities’ parliaments and cantonal authorities.The state election commission said a moderate candidate for the Croat member of the presidency, Zeljko Komsic, had 49 percent of the votes, while nationalist contender Dragan Covic had 38 percent.Sefik Dzaferovic, from the ruling Party of Democratic Action, won the Muslim seat in the presidency.More than half of Bosnia’s 3.3 million eligible voters cast ballots, election officials said. The campaign was marred by divisive rhetoric and allegations of irregularities that fueled tensions.Election officials described the voting that took place as “extremely fair.”____Sabina Niksic contributed from Sarajevo and Dusan Stojanovic from Belgrade, Serbia."

The company was also forced to temporarily shut down following a flood of threats and bogus orders.Commenting on his upcoming visit to Memories Pizza, MILO said:Gays have gone from having to hide in the closet to one of the most privileged groups in western society, and I’m sorry to say that we haven’t been very magnanimous in victory. Instead of making peace with society, we’ve gleefully persecuted harmless bakeries and pizza shops. It’s all the more outrageous when you consider that there’s a real threat to gays – Islam – that we’ve ignored at the behest of leftists. We are told that not getting a bakery product for our weddings is somehow important, but worrying about a religion that shoots us in nightclubs is Islamophobic. This has gone far enough.

Bannon against accusations of anti-Semitism — which erupted after president-elect Donald Trump announced that Bannon would serve as White House Chief Strategist.FromThe Hill:You recently attacked Bannon’s appointment as senior adviser to the president, saying, “It is a sad day when a man who presided over the premier website of the ‘alt-right’ — a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists — is slated to be a senior staff member in the ‘people’s house.’” Your comment was widely — though perhaps unfairly — interpreted as accusing Bannon of anti-Semitism.I barely know Mr. Bannon, having met him for the first time last week at The New York Hilton. But I do know Joel Pollak, an orthodox Jew who is my friend of many years and is a senior editor at Breitbart. Joel is one of the proudest Jews I know and one of the premier fighters for Israel in the national media.He tells me that Steve Bannon has shown him, and the many other Jewish employees at Breitbart, especially those who are observant, incredible sensitivity and flexibility in helping them always keep the Sabbath and observe the Jewish holidays.In addition, Breitbart has served as one of the leading publications in The United States that strongly opposed the Iran nuclear agreement, with its $150 billion given to the murderous Mullahs and their genocidal promise to perpetrate a second holocaust of the Jewish people.I know this is close to both our hearts. Your wife was forced to flee the bloodthirsty Khomeini regime as a teenager. My father and his family were lucky to leave Iran well before Khomeini came to power.In light of this fact, why would you immediately assume that Breitbart is anti-Semitic? Some of the world’s leading publications — including The New York Times — extolled the virtues of the Iran deal even though it never even punished the Iranian regime for being in constant violation of the 1948 UN Anti-Genocide Convention which expressly forbids genocidal incitement.Even the ADL opposed the Iran deal and Breitbart stood with the pro-Israel community in making the argument against an agreement that legally gives Iran nuclear weapons in little over a decade.Breitbart also defends Israel constantly against the anti-Semitic BDS movement whose goal is the economic destruction of the State of Israel.That does not mean that we need agree with everything published on Breitbart or that there will not be columns we find offensive.I write for many publications, some more on the left, like The Daily Beast and The Huffington Post, some considered in the middle like CNN, The Washington Post, and The Hill, and some more to the right like The Wall Street Journal and Breitbart. I also write for Israel-based publications like The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel, with their differing editorial slants. In all those publications there are those with whom I agree and disagree with strongly.I have published hundreds of columns in The Huffington Post and consider Arianna Huffington a personal friend. I can tell you that I shared the home page many times with people who vilified Israel in pretty extreme terms. I never took offense. And I certainly never called the editors there anti-Semitic. Rather, I saw the attacks on Israel as an opportunity to respond intelligently and forcefully.The Jewish people, as you and I can both agree, face a new era of increased anti-Semitism, especially among Islamist governments and increasingly in Europe. We have real enemies who need to be combatted. Israel especially faces three emboldened, genocidal enemies: Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. Breitbart columnists have stood strongly against all three.Read the rest of the letterhere."
702214939,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2010/12/01/Who-is-Julian-Assange,Who is Julian Assange?,"While Wikileaks’ Julian Assange ismuch in the news, there’s been very little written about the individual and the forces that likely played a role in shaping him. Certainly he’s bright enough and claims to embrace some new form of Internet-enabled informational freedom. But I’d argue one need look no further than American post-sixties culture to realize that freedom without responsibility can produce anarchy, or worse. Far from some master of the informational universe, in some ways,Assange looks weak and dependent upon othersto sustain and guide him through the real world.In private, however, Assange is often bemused and energetic. He can concentrate intensely, in binges, but he is also the kind of person who will forget to reserve a plane ticket, or reserve a plane ticket and forget to pay for it, or pay for the ticket and forget to go to the airport. People around him seem to want to care for him; they make sure that he is where he needs to be, and that he has not left all his clothes in the dryer before moving on. At such times, he can seem innocent of the considerable influence that he has acquired.This may bea telling bit, if one digs just a bit deeper.Assange’s parents ran a touring theatre company. In 1979, his mother, Christine, remarried; her new husband was a musician who belonged to a controversial New Age group led by Anne Hamilton-Byrne. The couple had a son, but broke up in 1982 and engaged in a custody struggle for Assange’s half-brother. His mother then took both children into hiding for the next five years. Assange moved several dozen times during his childhood, attending many schools, sometimes being home schooled, and later attending several universities at various times in Australia.Enterthe Santiniketan Park Association, or:The Family and The Great White Brotherhood, is a controversial New Age group formed in Australia under the leadership of the Yoga teacher Anne Hamilton-Byrne.While perhaps impossible to know precisely what forces shaped Assange, it’s not a stretch to suspect that some of them may have been rather unusual, to put it mildly. One could almost see Assange as one of Hamilton-Byrne’s own children, to the extent  they were hers, of course.Anne Hamilton-Byrne acquired fourteen infants and young children between about 1968 and 1975. Some were the natural children of Santiniketan members, others had been obtained through irregular adoptions arranged by lawyers, doctors and social workers within the group who could bypass the normal processes. The children’s identities were changed using false birth certificates or deed poll, all being given the surname ‘Hamilton-Byrne’ and dressed alike even to the extent of their hair being dyed uniformly blonde.The children were kept in seclusion and home-schooled at Kia Lama, a rural property usually referred to as “Uptop,” at Taylor Bay on Lake Eildon near the town of Eildon, Victoria. They were taught that Anne Hamilton-Byrne was their biological mother, and knew the other adults in the group as ‘aunties’ and ‘uncles’.They were denied almost all access to the outside world, and subjected to a discipline that included frequent corporal punishment and starvation diets.The children were frequently dosed with the psychiatric drugs Anatensol, Diazepam, Haloperidol, Largactil, Mogadon, Serepax, Stelazine, Tegretol or Tofranil.On reaching adolescence they were compelled to undergo an initiation involving LSD: while under the influence of the drug the child would be left in a dark room, alone, apart from visits by Hamilton-Byrne or one of the psychiatrists from the group.A few children managed to escape. One adoptive daughter, Sarah Hamilton-Byrne, later wrote a book,Unseen Unheard Unknown, in which she claimed, among other things, that children were stolen. She claimed that her biological mother had come to get rid of a baby and that members of the medical establishment in Melbourne and Geelong took part in a process where women were told that their babies had died at birth, when they had actually been taken away and eventually passed on to Anne Hamilton-Byrne.Going back to what we can learn of himfrom Wikipedia, he’s something of a traveling show, himself. Six universities in 3 years, but no degrees? True, he’s innovative, but to what effect? And therein may lie the problem with Julian Assange. The case could be made that he’s a perennial mess in need of cleaning up after. And now, thanks to the Internet and an age where freedom, or what passes for it, is often held up as the only standard, without consideration for its consequences, or a prerequisite sense of responsibility required to enjoy it without doing great harm, it may fall to some government,with the help of Interpol, to put  irresponsible, if not anarchistic, genie, Julian Assange back in the bottle for good.Unfortunately, along the lines of unintended consequences, the seemingly freedom loving Assange may  ultimately only drive world governments to reassess their views of the rather free form of communication  we think of as the Internet, making it all the more difficult for those capable of embracing freedom with at least a modicum of responsibility to protect their own freedoms in the end.  Far from freedom’s greatest champion, Assange may eventually be seen as one of its greatest enemies – though that feature of an Internet-enabled world was always going to emerge as a bug. And Assange is likely not the last one to emerge.In 1987, after turning 16, Assange began hacking under then name “Mendax” (derived from a phrase of Horace: “splendide mendax,” or “nobly untruthful”).He and two other hackers joined to form a group which they named the International Subversives. Assange wrote down the early rules of the subculture: “Don’t damage computer systems you break into (including crashing them); don’t change the information in those systems (except for altering logs to cover your tracks); and share information.”In response to the hacking, the Australian Federal Police raided his Melbourne home in 1991; he was reported to have accessed computers belonging to an Australian university, the Canadian telecommunications company Nortel, and other organisations, via modem.In 1992, he pleaded guilty to 24 charges of hacking and was released on bond for good conduct after being fined AU$2100.The prosecutor said “there is just no evidence that there was anything other than sort of intelligent inquisitiveness and the pleasure of being able to–what’s the expression–surf through these various computers.”Assange later commented, “It’s a bit annoying, actually. Because I co-wrote a book about [being a hacker], there are documentaries about that, people talk about that a lot. They can cut and paste. But that was 20 years ago. It’s very annoying to see modern day articles calling me a computer hacker. I’m not ashamed of it, I’m quite proud of it. But I understand the reason they suggest I’m a computer hacker now. There’s a very specific reason.”Child custody issues In 1989, Assange started living with his girlfriend and soon they had a son. She separated from him after the 1991 police raid and took their son.They engaged in a lengthy custody struggle, and did not agree on a custody arrangement until 1999. The entire process prompted Assange and his mother to form Parent Inquiry Into Child Protection, an activist group centered on creating a “central databank” for otherwise inaccessible legal records related to child custody issues in Australia.Computer programming and university studies In 1993, Assange started one of the first ISPs in Australia, known as “Suburbia.”Starting in 1994, Assange lived in Melbourne as a programmer and a developer of free software.In 1995, Assange wrote Strobe, the first free and open source port scanner.He contributed several patches to the PostgreSQL project in 1996.He helped to write the book Underground: Tales of Hacking, Madness and Obsession on the Electronic Frontier (1997), which credits him as a researcher and reports his history with International Subversives.Starting around 1997, he co-invented the Rubberhose deniable encryption system, a cryptographic concept made into a software package for Linux designed to provide plausible deniability against rubber-hose cryptanalysis; he originally intended the system to be used “as a tool for human rights workers who needed to protect sensitive data in the field.”Other free software that he has authored or co-authored includes the Usenet caching software NNTPCache and Surfraw, a command-line interface for web-based search engines. In 1999, Assange registered the domain leaks.org; “But,” he says, “then I didn’t do anything with it.”Assange has reportedly attended six universities. From 2003 to 2006, he studied physics and mathematics at the University of Melbourne. On his personal web page, he described having represented his university at the Australian National Physics Competition around 2005. He has also studied philosophy and neuroscience."

She was third in each of the initial four downhill races of the 2020-21 season.Mirjam Puchner of Austria was third Firday in 1:48.49.World champion Corinne Suter was fifth.Shiffrin, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and three-time World Cup overall champion, was the 31st racer out of the start gate and ended up more than 3 1/2 seconds behind Goggia.Shiffrin began as a technical specialist but has increasingly become a force in speed events, too, and her first World Cup downhill win came at Lake Louise in 2017.There will be another downhill on Saturday before a super-G wraps up the stop in Lake Louise on Sunday.___More AP skiing:https://apnews.com/hub/skiingandhttps://twitter.com/AP_Sports___More AP Winter Olympics:https://apnews.com/hub/winter-olympics"

He is showing his true colors with the way he bullies former Soviet states, especially Ukraine. He wants them back.10:43 PM EST:DANIEL FLYNN–The message of the opening ceremonies? Sport is just a massive prop for one long national infomercial. Athletes don’t belong in the seats watching.

Would it kill NBC to put up some lower thirds with his name?10:39 PM EST:DANIEL FLYNN–The hammer and sickle is a massive floating insult to the athletes from Poland, Romania, Hungary, and other nations once trapped behind the Iron Curtain. “Putin is saying, ‘It’s now okay to be nostalgic about these times,'” reports NBC’s David Remnick. It’s strange but telling that Putin would dwell on the Soviet era but jump over Yeltsin. He didn’t learn the lesson of the twentieth century.10:36 PM EST:MARY CHASTAIN–THAT’S IT? That’s all the fall of the Soviet Union receives? The girl floating in the air with a red balloon represents the fall of Communism. It represents quite possibly the biggest fall in modern history.I’m not shocked.10:35 PM EST:MARY CHASTAIN–NBC announcer just said Putin reviews the textbooks. No wonder this is all happy-go-lucky. Putin was a KGB agent during the Cold War.This is propaganda. This is how you witness revisionist revolution.10:31 PM EST:Creepy little girl returns for one last swoop over the stadium. She’s grabbing at a big red balloon whose wire hookups look like tiny spiders all around its circumference.10:29 PM EST:MARY CHASTAIN–WOW. WOW. They are making the Stalin era seem a little cheerful, eh?As Communism symbols are above them the people are shown in white. Clean. They’re smiling. My husband is singing “Happy Days” because that’s what it reminds him of.Those were not happy days in Russia.10:28 PM EST:DANIEL FLYNN–NBC announcer calls Soviet era “clearly the touchiest period of this program” as a stadium floor bathed in red features humans as cogs in a giant machine. I actually think they did a good job artistically of capturing the inhumane and unrealistic outlook of Communism: man as machine. Its tough to do it tastefully–imagine the Germans attempting a kitsch recreation of the Third Reich–but if you’re trying to retell a nation’s history it’s hard to skip over this part.10:27 PM EST:EZRA DULIS–That big black boat that just crossed the stage looked even more 3-D than the sailboat!Wait, that was a car?10:26 PM EST:MARY CHASTAIN–Weird. None of these workers are starving, being beaten or shot if they do not complete their work. Not a realistic show of the Russian Revolution.10:25 PM EST:TONY LEE–The opening ceremony made me think of Paul Bushkovitch’s book on Peter the Great (did not know much about him until I read it).

Lodwick, the Nordic combined skier, is a six-time Olympian who fractured his left shoulder last month. But he did not turn down an honor of a lifetime:The United States Flag Code, contained in Chapter 1 of Title Four of the United States Code, forbids the Stars and Stripes to be dipped “to any person or thing” except for rare situations involving naval vessels.While marching into a stadium and parading a flag might seem like a relatively routine task – albeit with billions of eyes watching – flag bearers actually have several things to remember as they perform the honor at an Olympic Games Opening Ceremony. Making sure the American flag is held high is considered the most important.“That was the main thing I was told,” said Cameron Myler, a luge athlete who carried the flag at Lillehammer in 1994, the third of her four Olympics. “Don’t dip the flag to anyone. They said to me that U.S. protocol says that the flag must not be dipped regardless of title, even though the Royal Family of Norway was in attendance.”The Flag Code law does not carry any formal punishment as part of its provisions. Even though it is strictly speaking a federal law, it is considered more akin to a set of guidelines.Here’s a photo of Lodwick carrying the flag:pic.twitter.com/N8PZxel9Jf— Olympics Games (@olympics24h)February 8, 2014"" data-btlnk=""

Seeing the Lithuanian, Latvians, and Ukrainians marching under their own flags, when they marched under a hammer-and-sickle in 1980, demonstrates this. Russia’s a freer place, too, even if it’s not quite free. This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the greatest historical event to occur in my lifetime. The celebration of that great event starts now.

The “Mexican” skier is vying for the “Most Interesting Man at the Olympics” honor with his “Mariachi” ski uniform. He even has a parody Twitter account. He’s the oldest athlete at the games and a pop singer. And the “Mexican” skieralso happens to be a German prince:Take Germany’s Prince Hubertus von Hohenlohe, who has emerged as the Sochi Olympics’ favorite underdog. The 55-year-old athlete, who will represent Mexico on the slalom course, made a splash when he debuted his race suiton NBClast week: a spandex Mariachi get-up, complete with fake embroidery, a ruffled shirt, a red cummerbund and cravat.Hohenlohe has admitted that, with the flashy outfit, he’s compensating for what look like slim chances of making it to the podium, joking that he could at least win for being best-dressed. Hohenlohe’s hat tip to Mexico’s folk music traditions may also be an attempt to win over any countrymen who may still be dubious of his south-of-the-border street cred (despite this being thesixth timehe’s skied for the country): though his grandmother was half-Mexican and Hohenlohe was born in Mexico City, he grew up far from the country. The descendant of an aristocratic German family which once ruled the principality of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Hubertus learned to ski in the backyards of his European boarding schools.pic.twitter.com/rXlWbyqAMZ— Traje De Hubertus (@TrajeDeHubertus)February 7, 2014"" data-btlnk=""

The movie is directed by James Ponsoldt (The Spectacular Now), and co-stars Karen Gillan, Patton Oswalt, Bill Paxton, Ellar Coltrane and Poorna Jagannathan.“Mae asks many of the same questions [as other grads]. She’s struggling, living with her parents, looking for meaning and frustrated,” Ponsolt told USA Today. “She lands her dream job. Then things start to get weird.”“Bailey’s notion is that knowing is good, and knowing everything is better. He believes all experiences should be available to everyone, not only the privileged or people who can afford them. He’s deeply interested in technology that can make people share all human experiences with everyone,” he added.“The Circle is probably like many tech companies, pushing the ethical boundaries over how much autonomy and freedom we should have and how much privacy we should have,” the director said.Ponsoldt previously said in a statement that Watson’s “incredible talent, sensitivity and deep intelligence” will bring “an electric energy” to The Circle. The movie opens in theaters April 28, 2017."

1004820740,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA3I89A00,Venezuela opposition: Chavez secrecy feeds rumors,"(AP) Venezuela opposition: Chavez secrecy feeds rumorsBy IAN JAMESAssociated PressCARACAS, VenezuelaVenezuela’s opposition demanded that the government reveal specifics of President Hugo Chavez’s condition on Wednesday, criticizing secrecy surrounding the ailing leader’s health more than three weeks after his cancer surgery in Cuba.Opposition coalition leader Ramon Guillermo Aveledo said at a news conference that the information provided by government officials “continues to be insufficient.”Chavez has not been seen or heard from since the Dec. 11 operation, and Vice President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday said the president’s condition remained “delicate” due to complications arising from a respiratory infection.Maduro also urged Venezuelans to ignore rumors about Chavez’s condition. Aveledo said the opposition has been respectful during Chavez’s illness but that “the secrecy is the source of the rumors.”“They should tell the truth,” Aveledo said, noting that Maduro had pledged to provide full reports about Chavez’s condition. He reiterated the opposition’s call for the government to release a medical report, and said all indications are that Chavez won’t be able to be sworn in to begin a new term on Jan. 10.If Chavez can’t take office on that date, Aveledo said the constitution is clear that the National Assembly president should then take over temporarily until a new election is held. He said what happens next in Venezuela should be guided by “the truth and the constitution.”If Chavez dies or is unable to continue in office, the Venezuelan Constitution says a new election should be held within 30 days.With rumors swirling that Chavez had taken a turn for the worse, Maduro said on Tuesday that he had met with the president twice, had spoken with him and would return to Caracas on Wednesday.“He’s totally conscious of the complexity of his post-operative state and he expressly asked us … to keep the nation informed always, always with the truth, as hard as it may be in certain circumstances,” Maduro said in the prerecorded interview in Havana, which was broadcast Tuesday night by the Caracas-based television network Telesur.Both supporters and opponents of Chavez have been on edge in the past week amid shifting signals from the government about the president’s health. Officials have reported a series of ups and downs in his recovery _ the most recent, on Sunday, announcing that he faced the new complications from a respiratory infection.Maduro did not provide any new details about Chavez’s complications during Tuesday’s interview. But he joined other Chavez allies in urging Venezuelans to ignore gossip, saying rumors were being spread due to “the hatred of the enemies of Venezuela.”He didn’t refer to any rumors in particular, though one circulating online had described Chavez as being in a coma.Maduro said Chavez faces “a complex and delicate situation.” But Maduro also said that when he talked with the president and looked at his face, he seemed to have “the same strength as always.”“All the time we’ve been hoping for his positive evolution. Sometimes he has had light improvements, sometimes stationary situations,” he said.Maduro’s remarks about the president came at the end of an interview in which he praised Cuba’s government effusively and touched on what he called the long-term strength of Chavez’s socialist Bolivarian Revolution movement. He mentioned that former Cuban President Fidel Castro had visited the hospital where Chavez was treated.In Bolivia, President Evo Morales said he is concerned about his friend and ally.“I hope we can see him soon,” Morales told reporters at a news conference Wednesday. “But it’s a very worrying situation.”“I’ve tried to make contact with the vice president, and it’s been difficult. I hope all of their aims are achieved to save President Chavez’s life.”Before his operation, Chavez acknowledged he faced risks and designated Maduro as his successor, telling supporters they should vote for the vice president if a new presidential election was necessary.Maduro didn’t discuss the upcoming inauguration plans, saying only that he is hopeful Chavez will improve.The vice president said that Chavez “has faced an illness with courage and dignity, and he’s there fighting, fighting.”“Someone asked me yesterday by text message: How is the president? And I said, `With giant strength,'” Maduro said. He recalled taking Chavez by the hand: “He squeezed me with gigantic strength as we talked.”___Associated Press writers Jorge Rueda in Caracas and Paola Flores in La Paz, Bolivia, contributed to this report.___Ian James on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ianjamesap"

The exhibit opens Feb. 12.Palestinians object to the exhibit because it displays artifacts from West Bank sites. Archaeology official Hamdan Taha says the project was not coordinated with the Palestinians and violates international law.The museum says it will return the antiquities after the exhibit closes in nine months."

Richard Burr to Resign for Dumping Stocks After Coronavirus Briefings,"Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), two prominent members of the far-left “Squad,” have publicly expressed support for Tucker Carlson’s call for Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) to resign for purportedlydumpingup to $1.7 million in stock after receiving confidential coronavirus briefings.The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman reportedlyunloaded“between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings on Feb. 13 in 33 separate transactions,” according to ProPublica. Those transactions coincided with the intelligence committee receiving daily briefings on the spread and threat of the coronavirus.Fox News’s Carlson forcefullycalledfor Burr to resign during Thursday’sTucker Carlson Tonight— a call both Omar and Ocasio-Cortez appeared to publicly support.“I am 100% with him on this,” Omar wrote alongside an emoji, expressing her shock:Ocasio-Cortez also seemed to signal support:“You may have seen news reports this afternoon that chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee sold more than a million dollars in stock in mid-February after learning about how devastating the Chinese coronavirus could be,” Carlson said Thursday evening.“He had inside information about what could happen to our country, which is now happening,” he continued. “But he didn’t warn the public. He didn’t give a primetime address. He didn’t go on television to sound the alarm.”“He didn’t even disavow an op-ed he’d written just 10 days before claiming America was ‘better prepared than ever for coronavirus,” he added.He continued:He didn’t do any of those things. Instead, what did he do? He dumped his shares in hotel stocks so he wouldn’t lose money, and then he stayed silent. Maybe there is an honest explanation for what he did. If there is, he should share it with the rest of us immediately. Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate and face prosecution for insider trading. There is no greater moral crime than betraying your country in a time crisis, and that appears to be what happened.Burr released a statement on Friday, claiming that he relied “solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13.”“Specifically, I closely followed CNBC’s daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time,” he continued, adding that he asked the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee to “open a complete review of the matter with full transparency”:"
2066701841,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DAAREM9O0,Report: CIA helped Colombia kill rebel leaders,"(AP) Report: CIA helped Colombia kill rebel leadersWASHINGTONA covert CIA program has helped Colombia’s government kill at least two dozen leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the rebel insurgency also known as FARC, The Washington Post reported Saturday.The National Security Agency has also provided “substantial eavesdropping help” to the Colombian government, according to the Post. And the U.S. provided Colombia with GPS equipment that can be used to transform regular munitions into “smart bombs” that can accurately home in on specific targets, even if they are located in dense jungles.In March 2008, Colombian forces killed a top FARC commander, Raul Reyes, in one of several jungle camps the rebels operated in Ecuador, just across the border. The Post report Saturday said Colombia used U.S.-made smart bombs in the operation.The report is based on interviews with more than 30 former and current U.S. and Colombian officials, who the Post said spoke on condition of anonymity because the program is classified and ongoing.The CIA would not comment on the Post report. Without going into detail, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos told the Post that the CIA has been “of help,” providing Colombian forces with “better training and knowledge.”The multibillion-dollar program was funded secretly and separately from $9 billion in aid that the U.S. has openly provided to Colombia, mostly in military assistance. It was authorized by President George W. Bush and has continued under President Barack Obama, the newspaper reported.Colombia’s government and FARC have been engaged in peace talks in Havana since late 2012, but there has been no ceasefire between the two sides. Earlier this month Santos blamed the rebels for an attack on a police post that killed nine people, including civilians, military and a police officer.The FARC rebels took up arms in 1964. The U.S.-backed military buildup has reduced FARC’s ranks to about 9,000 fighters and killed several top commanders, though the rebels insist they are still a potent force."
4624444400,http://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-clinton-eye-super-tuesday-boost-as-voting-begins/,"Trump, Clinton eye ‘Super Tuesday’ boost as voting begins","Fairfax (United States) (AFP) – Americans began voting Tuesday in what is deemed the most pivotal day in the presidential nominating process, with frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hoping to wipe out their rivals.Voters in a dozen states will take part in “Super Tuesday” — a series of primaries and caucuses in states ranging from Alaska to Virginia, with Virginia the first to open its polling stations at 6:00 am (1100 GMT).If Democrat Clinton and Republican Trump — an outspoken billionaire political neophyte who has unexpectedly tapped into a vein of conservative rage at conventional politics — win big, it could spell doom for their challengers.Hours before polls opened, the duo made last-ditch appeals to supporters ahead of a day like few others on the calendar leading up to the November election for the White House.Trump’s Republican rivals, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, were frantically trying to halt the real estate magnate’s march toward nomination, seeking to unite the party against the man they see as a non-conservative political interloper.Clinton is riding high after thrashing rival Bernie Sanders in South Carolina over the weekend, securing an astronomical 86 percent of the African-American vote in her third win in four contests.Should she win black voters by similar margins in places such as Alabama, Georgia and Virginia, she should dominate there to become once again the inevitable candidate.That was her status at the start of the campaign — before the rise of Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.She was leaving nothing to chance, traveling to multiple states on Monday to urge a strong turnout.Clinton also took aim at the increasingly hostile campaign rhetoric on the Republican side led by Trump.– Scapegoating, finger-pointing –“I really regret the language being used by Republicans. Scapegoating people, finger-pointing, blaming. That is not how we should behave toward one another,” she told hundreds gathered at a university in Fairfax, Virginia.“We’re going to demonstrate, starting tomorrow on Super Tuesday, there’s a different path that Americans ought to take.”Trump’s incendiary campaign has infuriated Republican rivals, including mainstream favorite Rubio who has intensified his personal attacks and stressed Trump would have trouble in a general election.The Florida senator warned supporters in Tennessee that US media and Democratic groups will jump on Trump “like the hounds of hell” if he wins the nomination.But Trump is clearly in the driver’s seat. He is leading in polls in at least eight of the 11 Super Tuesday states.And a new CNN/ORC poll shows the billionaire expanding his lead nationally, earning a stunning 49 percent of support compared to second place Rubio, at 16 percent.Cruz of Texas is third, at 15 percent, followed by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 10 percent and Ohio Governor John Kasich at six percent.Trump punched back against Rubio, calling him “Little Marco,” mocking him for sweating on the campaign trail and warning that he could not stand up to strong men like Russian President Vladimir Putin.– ‘Party of Lincoln’ –Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric, in which he has accused Mexico of sending rapists across the border, mocked women and the disabled and urged a ban on Muslims entering the country, would have been the undoing of a normal candidate.But the 2016 cycle has been anything but normal, with a furious electorate keen to back an outsider who scorns the political establishment.“I’m representing a lot of anger out there,” Trump told CNN.“We’re not angry people, but we’re angry at the way this country’s being run.”In the latest controversy, Trump came under withering criticism for not immediately disavowing the support of David Duke, who once led the Ku Klux Klan.Rubio said Trump’s failure to promptly repudiate Duke, who has expressed support for Trump, makes him “unelectable.”Some conservatives have said they will shun Trump if he is the nominee.“This is the party of Abraham Lincoln,” said Senator Ben Sasse, accusing Trump of being a non-conservative plotting a “hostile takeover” of the party.Trump supporters “need to recognize that there are a whole bunch of other people who say, if this becomes the David Duke/Donald Trump party, there are a lot of us who are out,” he told MSNBC.If Trump sweeps the South, where many of the Super Tuesday races are taking place, it could be lights out for his Republican challengers.Texas is the largest prize on Tuesday, and Cruz is banking on winning his home state. He trails in nearly all other Super Tuesday states.Almost 600 Republican delegates are up for grabs Tuesday, nearly half the 1,237 needed to secure the nomination.Some 865 Democratic delegates are at stake, 36 percent of those needed to win."
7057402193,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2014/11/17/romanias-new-president-vows-to-tackle-corruption/,Romania's New President Vows to Tackle Corruption,"Hours after pulling off Romania’s biggest political earthquake since the revolution which overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu, the country’s soft-spoken new president followed through Monday on his vow to tackle corruption.Klaus Iohannis, the ethnic German mayor of the medieval Transylvanian city of Sibiu, won a shock second-round election victory on Sunday by defeating the heavily-tipped Prime Minister Victor Ponta, with whom he must now work in what could be a fraught cohabitation.The two men appeared to be on a collision course with Iohannis insisting that parliament throw out a law Ponta supported for an amnesty for politicians and judges accused of corruption.Ponta, who easily won the first round on November 2, was forced earlier this year to backtrack on a law that would have given politicians and government officials immunity from prosecution.The election was seen as pivotal for the second poorest country in the EU as it struggles to overcome an entrenched culture of corruption.– ‘Corrupt politicians’ –Tens of thousands of people took to the streets between the two rounds of voting to support anti-corruption prosectors from the DNA office, and to condemn “corrupt” politicians.Ponta’s ruling Social Democrats have blocked corruption probes into contracts with Microsoft and the aircraft giant EADS and refused to lift the immunity of several party members.Iohannis, leader of the centre-right Liberal Party, campaigned on anti-graft platform to turn Romania into a “normal” country.Political analyst Radu Alexandru said his “historic” win was a “victory of the people against a system run by the political parties in their own interests”, and a boost for democracy in central Europe amid a rising tide of authoritarianism, particularly in neighbouring Hungary.Iohannis, 55, who faced accusations of not being a “real Romanian”, comes from the German-speaking minority, which now numbers less than 36,000 people.Most left the country after the collapse of communism after suffering decades of persecution under Ceausescu.But Radu said after turning the tables on the ruling party, the rigorous but uncharismatic Iohannis could find himself in a tricky stand-off with 42-year-old Ponta.The previous cohabitation between Ponta and right-wing President Traian Basescu was so stormy it often brought the work of government to a standstill.Iohannis — who had more than 54 percent of the vote with almost all ballots counted — has promised this will not be the case this time.– Diaspora vote key –Analyst Radu Magdin said the votes of the three million Romanians who live abroad had a huge impact on the results.He said Iohannis’ win was a not just a “massive anti-Ponta” vote, but a backlash against the authorities contempt for the diaspora, thousands of whom claimed they were stopped from voting in the first round.Professor Alina Mungiu Pippidi, of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, said the “involvement of Romanians abroad was a major step forward, because they cannot be bought and they know another Europe.”Only 160,000 Romanians abroad were able to cast their ballots in the first round due to a lack of polling stations in countries including France, Germany and Britain.But on Sunday, long queues of voters snaked outside polling stations in Paris, London and several other European cities.In the evening, thousands were still waiting to vote in some cities, sparking renewed anger at the way the vote has been organised.Police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of angry would-be voters at the Romanian embassy in Paris, who said they had not been able to cast their ballot.In Bucharest, several thousand people took to the streets in solidarity with expatriates they said were being prevented from voting."
6438178150,http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/01/25/obama-farrakhan-photo-released-13-year-media-cover/,Obama-Farrakhan Photo Released After 13-Year Media Cover-up,"A photograph of then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that was taken in 2005 at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, DC, was released Saturday after a 13-year cover-up to protect Obama’s political career.Journalist Askia Muhammad toldTriceEdneyWire.comthat he took the photograph after Obama had engaged “in a warm conversation with constituent and fellow Chicagoan Minister Louis Farrakhan.” However, he realized that the photograph could endanger Obama’s presidential ambitions, which were already being widely discussed.Farrakhan is a black supremacist and antisemite who also holds anti-gay views. Rumors of an association between Obama and Farrakhan circulated during the 2008 presidential campaign in the wake of revelations about Obama’s decades-long membership in the Trinity United Church of Christ, led by the racist preacher Jeremiah Wright.Those rumors could not be substantiated, however — and the story of Muhammad’s long-hidden photograph explains why.Asia told TraceEdneyWire.com that he was confronted by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus about the photograph, and that he eventually surrendered it to Farrakhan’s chief of staff. He secretly kept a copy of the image for himself, but he never told anyone and never released the image, for fear of burglary or retaliation against him, hetoldthe left-wing Talking Points Memo website.He told TraceEdneyWire.com that he believed the photograph would have destroyed Obama’s electoral chances:“I gave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy,” Muhammad said in an exclusive interview with the Trice Edney News Wire this week. “But after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover.”As for any debate that the photo could have made a difference in the outcome of the Obama presidential election, Muhammad is emphatic: “I insist. It absolutely would have made a difference.”Farrakhan, born Louis Eugene Walcott, has led the Nation of Islam (NOI) since 1981. NOI is a cultish new religious movement founded in the 1930s by Wallace Fard Muhammad, a man who claimed to be the the Messiah cometh as well as the “Mahdi” of Islam.NOI’s primary beliefs, hammered out under the leadership of “the honorable” Elijah Muhammad in the 1940s and 50s, include that white people are inherently “devils,” who exist because a black scientist named Jakub “grafted” them into existence on an island in the fifth millennium B.C.Whites “devils” were, according to the NOI, bred to be evil for hundreds of years by Jakub, and eventually learned to use “tricknology” to enslave blacks.Farrakhan and the NOI also have a long history of antisemitism. Farrakhan has, for example, spoken highly of Hitler’s abilities as a leader, and repeatedlyindulgedin sermons on “Jewish control” of various industries. He also infamously referred to Judaism as a “gutter religion.”The photograph also includes “Minister Farrakhan’s son-in-law, Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad; His son and security chief, Mustapha Farrakhan; Minister Farrakhan’s son Joshua Farrakhan; and the Rev. Willie Wilson, executive producer of the program for Farrakhan’s Million Man March in 1995 and a chairman of the 20th anniversary,” according to TraceEdneyWire.com.Muhammad told Talking Points Memo that he felt more at ease about the photograph after Farrakhan publicly revealed in 2016 that he had met with then-Senator Obama, and he obtained Farrakhan’s permission to publish the photograph as he was preparing a memoir last year.The late NBC journalist Tim Russertaskedthen-candidate Obama at a 2008 debate in Cleveland, Ohio whether he accepted Farrakhan’s public support. Obama responded by claiming he had denounced Farrakhan and had “consistently distanced” himself from him.Obamassaid:You know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan’s antisemitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support. He expressed pride in an African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can’t censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we’re not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan.…I live in Chicago. He lives in Chicago. I’ve been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate. And I have consistently distanced myself from him.Obama did not explicitly reject Farrakhan’s support.There are other, similar instances in which Obama claimed to have had no association with radicals and was later discovered to have lied.For example, Obama claimed during the 2008 campaign that he had no continuing links with former Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers, with whom Obama had served on a board in the 1990s. Breitbart Newsdiscoveredthat then-Sen. Obama had attended a barbecue at Ayers’s home in Chicago in July 2005.In 2012, Breitbart Newslaunchedan investigative series, “The Vetting,” devoted to uncovering those aspects of Barack Obama’s past that the media had overlooked or deliberately hidden.The Muhammad photograph proves that there was a rich mine of information that was withheld from the public to protect Obama’s career and policy goals.Ian Mason contributed to this article.Joel B.

The attack took place two weeks ago and left two of the chief’s bodyguards wounded. His armored truck sustained more than 100 bullet strikes.Celaya, Guanajuato, Police Chief José Carlos Ramos-Ramos turned in his resignation this past Friday — just 21 days after being named the Police Director of Celaya,according toa local media report. The departure from his newly appointed post comes one week after he survived a fierce attack by cartel hitmen while traveling as part of a two-vehicle convoy on the Celaya-Salamanca highway on November 15.According to local media reports, Chief Ramos-Ramos was traveling in a two-vehicle convoy with his assigned bodyguards and at least one member of the Guardia National (National Guard). While traveling on the highway, a truck occupied by numerous cartel operatives intercepted the chief’s convoy and directed intense rifle fire, specifically at the director’s vehicle. The bodyguards reportedly sprung to action and repelled the attack by returning gunfire at the shooters. A cell phone video (above) released on social media captured intense audio of the attack.After the chief’s security personnel repelled the attack, security elements from the state, municipal police, and the Mexican army responded to the area. Investigators from the state attorney general’s office processed the crime scene the night of the November 15 attack and recovered over 480 spent .223 caliber shell casing and ten spent .50 caliber shell casings. Officials from the state attorney general’s office also reported that the cartel hitmen were also armed with a grenade launcher and grenades. Both chief’s bodyguards were wounded during the attack — one severely.Chief Ramos-Ramos previously served as Chief of Police in the municipality of Leon, Guanajuato, but resigned in July of this year after receiving numerous credible death threats, according to a Breitbart law enforcement source.The city of Celaya, as along with the rest of the state of Guanajuato, has been the location of a bitter turf war between organized crime drug and fuel theft gangs. The city of Celaya registered 103 homicides during October, with 11 coming in one single day, early in the month,according tolocal media reports.Robert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs. Arce completed work assignments in the Balkans, Iraq, Haiti, and recently completed a three-year tour in Monterrey, Mexico, for the U.S. Department of State, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Program."

April 2020) hat die in Japan ansässige (TOKYO: 4452), zu deren Markenportfolio , , , und gehören, Zwischenberichte zu ihrer ESG-Strategie (kurz für Environmental, Social and Governance bzw. Umwelt, Soziales und Unternehmensführung), Einzelheiten zu den gemachten Fortschritten werden im „Kao Sustainability Data Book Kirei Lifestyle Plan Progress Report 2020“ veröffentlicht und zusammen mit dem integrierten Bericht auf der Unternehmenswebsite von Kao zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Veröffentlichung der englischen Versionen ist für Juni geplant.Diese Pressemitteilung enthält multimediale Inhalte. Die vollständige Mitteilung hier ansehen:Kirei Lifestyle Plan (Graphic: Business Wire)Im April 2019 legte Kao seine ESG-Strategie, den Kirei Lifestyle Plan, fest, um den „Kirei Lifestyle“ zu verwirklichen, eine Vision für eine sanftere und nachhaltigere Lebensweise, nach der Verbraucher auf der ganzen Welt zunehmend ihren Wunsch äußern. Der Kirei Lifestyle Plan besteht aus drei Verpflichtungen, die von 19 Kao-Führungsmaßnahmen unterstützt werden, um die Vision des Kirei Lifestyle bis 2030 umzusetzen.Nach nur einem Jahr mit dem Kirei Lifestyle Plan zeigt der Bericht auf, dass die Kao Corporation mit einem beeindruckenden Spektrum an Aktivitäten einen soliden Start in Richtung der Erfüllung ihrer Verpflichtungen für 2030 hingelegt hat. Beispiele hierfür sind die Entwicklung von Bio IOS für die Führungsmaßnahme der Förderung eines nachhaltigen Lebensstils, die Einführung von für zweckorientierte Marken, die Entwicklung von Feinfasertechnologie und RNA-Monitoring für transformative Produktinnovationen, die Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien zur Dekarbonisierung und der breit angelegte Beginn des -Verkaufs in Geschäften sowie die Einstellung der Verwendung auffälliger Kunststoffaufkleber auf Produktverpackungen für Zero Waste.Die ESG-Bemühungen von Kao wurden von mehreren externen Stellen anerkannt und validiert. Kao wurde in die A-Liste aufgenommen, die höchste Bewertung für Klimawandel und Wasser durch CDP, eine namhafte internationale Non-Profit-Organisation, basierend auf einer globalen Umfrage zur Reaktion von Unternehmen auf den Klimawandel und zu ihren Aktivitäten in Bezug auf die Wassersicherheit. Im Jahr 2020 wurde Kao zum sechsten Mal in Folge in den Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) aufgenommen, einer der weltweit bekanntesten Indizes für sozial verantwortliches Investment. Kao wurde zudem von der US-amerikanischen Denkfabrik Ethisphere Institute in die Liste der „World’s Most Ethical Companies ® 2020“ aufgenommen. Dies ist das vierzehnte Jahr in Folge, in dem das Unternehmen in die Liste aufgenommen wurde – es ist ein KPI für die Vergütung von Führungskräften bei Kao.Zur Veröffentlichung des Zwischenberichts zum Kirei Lifestyle Plan stellt Dave Muenz, Executive Officer der ESG-Abteilung von Kao, Folgendes fest: „Um ESG-gesteuertes zu implementieren, d. h., um unsere -Fertigung mit ESG-Perspektiven zu implementieren, haben wir besprochen, welche Aktivitäten für unser Unternehmen am effektivsten und am besten geeignet sind, und dann durchgeschaltet, um sie auszuführen. Wir haben spezifische Ziele festgelegt, auf die hingearbeitet werden soll, einschließlich Ziele zur Reduzierung der CO 2 -Emissionen, die von der Initiative Science Based Targets (SBT) genehmigt und veröffentlicht werden. Da das Engagement der Mitarbeiter bei der Umsetzung dieser Aktivitäten von entscheidender Bedeutung ist, konzentrieren wir uns auch auf die interne Schulung und den Dialog mit den Mitarbeitern. Wir haben zwei externe Experten in den im letzten Jahr eingerichteten externen ESG-Beirat aufgenommen. Dieser Rat erstellt Berichte und macht Vorschläge als Antwort auf Anfragen des ESG-Ausschusses, und seine externen, globalen Standpunkte beeinflussen unsere Managementaktivitäten. Wir werden uns weiterhin bemühen, ein Geschäft zu führen, das zu einem innen wie außen schönen Leben beiträgt.“Kao ermöglicht es Menschen, durch Informationen, Dienstleistungen und Produkte für einen sparsamen Umgang mit wertvollen Ressourcen wie Energie und Wasser einen nachhaltigeren Lebensstil zu führen.Bio IOS wird aus den Resten der Früchte der Ölpalme hergestellt, die gesammelt und zu Speiseöl gepresst werden. Palmöl ist das am häufigsten verwendete Mehrzwecköl unter allen weltweit vermarkteten natürlichen Pflanzenölzutaten (190 Mio. Tonnen im Geschäftsjahr 2017). Die festen Fette, die aus den beim Pressen von Palmöl übrig gebliebenen Rückständen gewonnen werden, haben lange Kohlenstoffketten und konnten bisher nur bedingt weiterverwendet werden. Bio IOS ist eine äußerst nachhaltige Waschmittelgrundlage der nächsten Generation, da es in der Vergangenheit kaum verwendete Fette effektiv nutzen und in Zukunft Algenöle extrahieren kann. Bio IOS wurde erstmals in für kommerzielle Zwecke eingesetzt, einem konzentrierten flüssigen Waschmittel, das 2019 in Japan als nachhaltiges Waschmittel eingeführt wurde.Die Vermarktung von Bio IOS entspricht auch der folgenden Kao-Führungsmaßnahme: Verantwortungsbewusster Umgang mit Rohstoffen.Jede Kao-Marke hat einen Zweck, der Lösungen für soziale Probleme in den von ihr berührten Gemeinschaften oder Gesellschaften bietet.Im April 2020 begann Kao über die Tochtergesellschaft Kao USA mit dem Verkauf von , einer den Kirei-Lebensstil verkörpernden Marke, in den USA (Foto von links: Shampoo, Haarspülung und Flüssigseife, für die jeweils Nachfüllpackungen erhältlich sind). Mit dem Start dieses Geschäftszweigs in den USA wird Kao einzigartige Produkte unter Einsatz von Technologien anbieten, die aus Grundlagenforschung bei Kao hervorgegangen sind, sodass sie eine geringere Umweltbelastung aufweisen und sehr benutzerfreundlich sind.Die Verpackung der Marke stellt die erste praktische Anwendung der von Kao entwickelten „Air in Film Bottle“-Technologie dar. Die Folie ist ein flexibles Material, das in Nachfüllpackungen wie dem *1 von Kao verwendet wird. Durch das Einbringen von Luft in die äußere Schicht der Folienverpackung wird die Verpackung so gedehnt, dass sie für sich allein stehen und als Flasche verwendet werden kann. Dies kann den Kunststoffverbrauch im Vergleich zu Pumpflaschen um ca. 50 % reduzieren. Kao bietet eine Reihe von Nachfüllpackungen an, um den wiederholten Einsatz von Pumpflaschen zu fördern. Die „Air in Film Bottle“-Verpackung erleichtert im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen Plastikflaschen auch die Verwendung des gesamten Flüssigkeitsinhalts. Kao plant das Angebot einer größeren Auswahl an Produkten, mit denen Verbraucher am Kirei-Lebensstil teilhaben können. *1: Eine von Kao eigens entwickelte und beworbene Folienverpackung, die leichter nachzufüllen ist und es einfacher macht, den gesamten Flüssigkeitsinhalt aufzubrauchen.Die Einführung der Marke entspricht auch der folgenden Kao-Führungsmaßnahme: Zero Waste.Kao geht wichtigen Forschungsprojekten nach, um bahnbrechende Innovationen hervorzubringen, die dazu beitragen, einen nachhaltigeren Lebensstil zu verwirklichen, indem soziale Probleme gelöst und die Schmerzen der Menschen gelindert werden. Die folgenden beiden Forschungs- und Entwicklungsergebnisse sind Teil der sozialen Innovationen von Kao, um zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität beizutragen.Kao richtete seine Feinfasertechnologie bereits 2018 ein, die eine geschichtete, ultradünne Membran mit einem Durchmesser von weniger als 1 μm direkt auf der Haut erzeugt. Die leichte, weiche Membran bewegt sich flexibel mit der Haut und fügt sich auf natürliche Weise ein, ohne sich leicht zu lösen. Die Membran behält eine ausreichende Feuchtigkeitsdurchlässigkeit bei, ohne die Haut vollständig zu blockieren, und ermöglicht das gleichmäßige Auftragen und Zurückhalten von kosmetischen Produkten innerhalb der Membran. Im Jahr 2019 entwickelte Kao einen Hochleistungsdiffusor, mit dem Verbraucher die ultradünne Membran zu Hause herstellen können, einen Schönheitstrick, um unter Verwendung des Diffusors einen ultradünnen Schleier zu erzeugen, und eine Schönheitsessenz. Kao brachte diese Innovationen als zweistufiges Hautpflegeprodukt auf den Markt, das eine intensive Feuchtigkeitsversorgung bietet. Der Hochleistungsdiffusor wurde gemeinsam mit der Appliances Company der Panasonic Corporation entwickelt, die über Beauty-Appliance-Technologien verfügt. In Zukunft wird Kao diese Feinfasertechnologie verwenden, um Make-up-Produkte für Grundierungszwecke zu entwickeln, die Poren, ungleichmäßige Färbungen, Flecken und andere Hautprobleme abdecken. Kao zielt auch darauf ab, Anwendungen für die Technologie zu entwickeln, die einen neuen Nutzen im medizinischen Bereich mit sich bringen, wie beispielsweise die Nachsorge bei Lasertherapie und die Behandlung von Hauterkrankungen infolge von Verletzungen.Im Jahr 2019 gab Kao bekannt, Daten zu ungefähr 10.000 Arten der RNA-Expression aus menschlichem Talg gesammelt und die ursprüngliche RNA-Monitoring-Technologie entwickelt zu haben, um diese Daten umfassend zu analysieren. Die Analyse von DNA ist effektiv, um die Eigenschaften zu verstehen, mit denen eine Person geboren wird, während die Analyse von RNA Einblicke in alltägliche Veränderungen der durch die Umwelt und andere Faktoren verursachten Bedingungen ermöglicht. Mit der aus Talg gewonnenen RNA kann diese Technologie auch charakteristische Veränderungen bei Menschen mit atopischer Dermatitis erkennen. Hautprobleme sind ein soziales Problem, das mit einer geringeren Lebensqualität verbunden ist. Kao kündigte außerdem ein Gemeinschaftsprojekt mit Preferred Networks, Inc., an, das derzeit durchgeführt wird, um Hauterkrankungen von individuellen Kunden zu verstehen, indem KI-Technologien wie maschinelles Lernen und Deep Learning mit Big Data zu RNA unter Berücksichtigung individueller Unterschiede kombiniert werden. Kao geht davon aus, dass durch die Bereitstellung optimierter Hautpflegemethoden durch RNA-Monitoring eine gesündere Haut und eine verbesserte Lebensqualität erreicht werden können, und setzt entsprechende Forschungs- und Entwicklungsbemühungen fort.Die weitere Anwendung und Erweiterung der beiden Technologien wird auch der folgenden Kao-Führungsmaßnahme entsprechen: Verbesserte Lebensqualität.Kao trägt zur globalen Dekarbonisierung bei, indem die CO 2 -Emissionen von Produkten über den gesamten Lebenszyklus auf ein Niveau reduziert werden, das dem Szenario einer globalen Erwärmung von 2 °C (oder nach Möglichkeit weniger) entspricht.Durch das Engagement für ein wissenschaftlich fundiertes (2 Grad Erwärmung) Ziel zur Reduzierung des Kohlendioxidausstoßes und den Kauf von 100 % erneuerbarer Energie unternimmt Kao aktiv Schritte zur Reduzierung seiner Treibhausgasemissionen. Kao hat sich das Ziel für 2030 *2 gesetzt, die Treibhausgasemissionen an allen Standorten um 22 % zu senken (gegenüber 2017). Das Unternehmen hat Photovoltaik-Stromerzeugungssysteme für den Eigenbedarf installiert und den Einsatz erneuerbarer Energien im Rahmen des zugekauften Stroms erhöht.Im Jahr 2019 wurden im Tochigi-Werk und im Toyohashi-Werk neue Solarsysteme installiert. Im Verlauf des Jahres 2019 stellten die Kao Chemicals GmbH (Deutschland), die Kao Manufacturing Germany GmbH und die drei Standorte der Kao Corporation S.A. (Spanien) sowie Kao Chimigraf, Molton Brown, Kao USA, Kao Sanitary Products Ehime und das Kawasaki-Werk von Kao ihren gesamten zugekauften Strom auf erneuerbare Energien um. Kao hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt, bis 2025 in Japan und bis 2030 konzernweit erneuerbare Energie für 100 % des zugekauften Stroms zu nutzen. Durch die Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien konnten die CO 2 -Emissionen von Kao um 95.000 Tonnen gesenkt werden. *2 Dieses Ziel wurde von der Initiative Science Based Targets bestätigt.Kao unterstützt den Übergang zu einer Kreislaufwirtschaft, indem das Unternehmen die Materialauswahl optimiert und den Verbrauch minimiert, alle Abfälle rezykliert und Verpackungen auf praktische Weise wiederverwendbar und rezyklierbar macht.Im Rahmen der Maßnahme „Innovation in Reduction“ zur Schaffung eines Kreislaufs mit Kunststoffen hat Kao die folgenden zwei Initiativen umgesetzt. Kao verbessert auch anhaltend die laufenden Aktivitäten, um Verpackungen dünner zu machen, die Verwendung von Nachfüllpackungen zu fördern, Produkte konzentrierter zu machen und Produkte in größeren Mengen zu verkaufen.Um von harten Plastikflaschen wegzukommen, weitet Kao ab April 2020 den Verkauf von in japanischen Geschäften aus, die in Kombination mit Nachfüllpackungen aus Folienmaterial für Shampoo und Haarspülungen mehrfach verwendet werden können. Im Jahr 2016 startete Kao den Verkauf von Nachfüllprodukten mit dem für dickflüssige Produkte wie Shampoos, Haarspülungen und Duschgels. Das besteht aus einer Folie, die eine Reduzierung des Kunststoffverbrauchs um ca. 80 % im Vergleich zur Primärverpackung und eine Reduzierung der CO 2 -Emissionen von der Herstellung bis zur Verwendung und Entsorgung um 3 % im Vergleich zu früheren Nachfüllpackungen ermöglicht. Der wurde seit seiner Einführung im Jahr 2017 hauptsächlich online verkauft. Mit dem Beginn des groß angelegten Verkaufs in Geschäften wird er nun mehr Verbrauchern zugänglich gemacht. Es wird erwartet, dass seine Vorteile die Verwendung umweltfreundlicher Nachfüllprodukte mit dem zusätzlich fördern.Kao verzichtet schrittweise auf die Verwendung auffälliger Kunststoffaufkleber, die auf Produktverpackungen angebracht werden, um die Aufmerksamkeit der Verbraucher auf sich zu ziehen. Dies betrifft die im Frühjahr 2020 eingeführten Duschgels (unter Ausschluss gewisser Produkte), Körperpflegeprodukte und Badezusätze der Marke . Auffällige Kunststoffaufkleber haben den Vorteil, dass sie den Verbrauchern zum Zeitpunkt des Kaufs gezielte Informationen wie Produktmerkmale und Gebrauchsanweisungen vermitteln.

5290009812,http://www.breitbart.com/news/trump-takes-florida-ohio-nc-in-battle-for-white-house/,"Trump takes Florida, Ohio, NC in battle for White House","WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump captured crucial victories over Hillary Clinton Tuesday night in Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, showing remarkable strength in three of the nation’s most fiercely fought battleground states in an unexpectedly tight race for the presidency.Clinton carried Virginia, Colorado and California. Her campaign had expected easy victories there, but the states took on new urgency as Trump picked up votes elsewhere. With a handful of other battleground states still undecided, neither candidate had cleared the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.The uncertainty sent Dow futures and Asian markets tumbling, reflecting investor concern over what a Trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade.As Clinton’s team anxiously waited for results to roll in, the candidate tweeted to supporters, “Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything.”Clinton, a fixture in American politics for decades, was hoping to become the first woman to serve as commander in chief. She faced stiff competition from Trump, the billionaire businessman who tapped into a searing strain of economic populism.Trump picked up a number of reliably Republican states, while Clinton won in Democratic territory. But the race was to be determined by fewer than a dozen competitive states where the candidates spent millions of dollars and much of the fall wooing voters.Exit polls underscored the deep divisions that have defined the 2016 contest. Women nationwide supported Clinton by a double-digit margin, while men were significantly more likely to back Trump. More than half of white voters backed the Republican, while nearly 9 in 10 blacks and two-thirds of Hispanics voted for the Democrat.Democrats’ path to retaking the Senate majority narrowed as Republicans held onto key seats in North Carolina, Indiana and Florida. The GOP was on track to secure two more years of House control.The 45th president will inherit an anxious nation, deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities, race and culture. The economy has rebounded from the depths of recession, though many Americans have yet to benefit. New terror threats from home and abroad have raised security fears.Clinton asked voters to keep the White House in her party’s hands for a third straight term. She cast herself as heir to President Barack Obama’s legacy and pledged to make good on his unfinished agenda, including passing immigration legislation, tightening restrictions on guns and tweaking his signature health care law.But she struggled throughout the race with persistent questions about her honesty and trustworthiness. Those troubles flared anew late in the race, when FBI Director James Comey announced a review of new emails from her tenure at the State Department. On Sunday, just two days before Election Day, Comey said there was nothing in the material to warrant criminal charges against Clinton.Trump, the New York real estate developer who lives in a gold-plated Manhattan penthouse, forged a striking connection with white, working-class Americans who feel left behind in the changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of many problems plaguing the nation and called for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.“I see so many hopes and so many dreams out there that didn’t happen, that could have happened, with leadership, with proper leadership,” he said by telephone on Fox News before casting his own ballot in Manhattan. “And people are hurt so badly.”Seven in 10 Americans who went to the polls Tuesday said immigrants now in the country illegally should be allowed to stay, while just a quarter said they should be deported. More than half oppose building a border wall, according to the exit polls, which were conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research.The Republican Party’s tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush declined to back Trump, instead selecting “none of the above” when they voted for president, according to spokesman Freddy Ford.Trump set both parties on edge when he refused to say in the third and final debate whether he would accept the election’s results, citing with no evidence the possibility of a rigged outcome. His statement threatened to undermine a fundamental pillar of American democracy and raised the prospect that his fervent supporters would not view Clinton as a legitimate president if she won.Asked Tuesday in an interview with Fox News if he would accept the election results, Trump continued to demur, saying “We’re going to see how things play out.”Most problems that did pop up at polling places Tuesday appeared to be routine — the kinds of snags that come every four years, including long lines, machines not working properly and issues with ballots or voter rolls.Even before Tuesday, almost 45 million people had cast ballots for president. Many expressed relief the end was in sight after an election season in which personal attacks often drowned out the issues.Clinton has denounced Trump for calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and promoting a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and for his long line of remarks about women that culminated in an audio in which he bragged about grabbing their genitals. Her campaign was hoping high turnout among Hispanics push her over the top in states like Florida and Nevada.“I grew up in a Hispanic family, and the way that Donald Trump has referred to illegal immigrants — being from illegal immigrants, I took that to heart,” said Angel Salazar, a 22-year-old sanitation associate from Oklahoma City. “I don’t like anything that he said. I don’t like his views. So I voted for Hillary Clinton because she supports us.”Trump called his opponent “Crooked Hillary” for her use of a private email server as secretary of state and her complicated ties to the family’s Clinton Foundation.___Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey, Bradley Klapper, Vivian Salama, Hope Yen, Jill Colvin and Lisa Lerer and AP Polling Director Emily Swanson contributed to this report.___Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC"
5502573358,http://www.breitbart.com/news/blame-me-says-klopp-after-reds-crash-out/,Blame me says Klopp after Reds crash out,"Liverpool (AFP) – Jurgen Klopp accepted responsibility for Liverpool’s stunning FA Cup fourth round exit as Championship club Wolves earned a shock 2-1 win at Anfield.Klopp’s line-up featured three teenagers and right-back Connor Randall starting his first game of the season, a selection which resulted in a third consecutive home defeat in the space of eight days.A home loss to Swansea all but ended Liverpool’s hopes of catching Premier League leaders Chelsea, while Southampton won at Anfield in the League Cup semi-finals in midweek.Liverpool must now face Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday, fixture congestion which goes some way to explaining why Klopp chose such a weakened line-up against Wolves.But the Reds boss was criticised by pundits, including England legend Gary Lineker and Liverpool great Mark Lawrenson, for his team selection and he accepted the blame.“I’m responsible, I feel responsible for this performance,” Klopp said. “I thought we could do better and obviously we couldn’t.“I have to think about this, learn about situations, players and all games. It was an important game for us and we couldn’t deliver.“I was asked if it is the low point of my Liverpool time until now and I don’t know if it is.“But if it is, it’s a perfect point to turn around because it is not possible to go lower. It is absolutely right that it feels bad.“I don’t feel that the players let me down. I am responsible for the line up. I saw them training and I thought that is the line up.“I am responsible for the bad things. We could have played better. Each boy could have played better. For each single performance there is an explanation.“I am never too harsh in criticism and you should not be too emotional.”– Damning –Lineker was particularly damning of Klopp’s approach to the FA Cup, a competition Liverpool have won seven times in their illustrious history.“Don’t get Klopp playing his reserves with no European football,” said Lineker via Twitter.“Shows a lack of knowledge of the depth in English football and respect.”Liverpool’s hopes of winning silverware this season are in tatters.But Klopp refused to be critical of any of his youngsters, or the handful of senior players who lined up alongside them.“We played a Championship team at Derby in the (League) cup and they had not a percentage of a chance. That is not years ago,” Klopp said.“It is not right to judge people in a very bad moment. It is not about not wanting, it is about not getting the right players in the transfer window.“We have to go through the history of Liverpool, better sides lost against worse sides. We know what we have to change, only we have to show it.“I cannot explain every single thing of today. I don’t look for excuses. Whatever you write, whatever you say is absolutely okay.”Richard Stearman headed Wolves in front inside the opening minute before Andreas Weimann doubled Wolves’ lead before the interval.Not until the 86th minute could Liverpool finally break down Wolves’ resilient defence, through Divock Origi, although the home side was unable to end their manager Paul Lambert’s record of never having lost at Anfield, as player or manager.“I’ve never been beaten here – that’s with Celtic, Villa, Norwich – but that one is the best,” Lambert said.“That surpasses everything because of the gulf in leagues, the gulf in players. But what we’ve got is incredible team spirit and really good young players.”"

8819889597,https://www.breitbart.com/news/sungjae-im-runs-the-tables-in-las-vegas-victory/,Sungjae Im runs the tables in Las Vegas victory,"Sungjae Im has run the tables in Las VegasSungjae Im runs the tables in Las Vegas victoryBy DOUG FERGUSONAP Golf WriterThe Associated PressLAS VEGASLAS VEGAS (AP) — Sungjae Im was so dialed into his game that he didn’t realize how many birdies he was making in turning a shootout into a one-man show in Las Vegas.Only when he saw a leaderboard after his big run was over — seven birdies in an eight-hole stretch around the turn Sunday at the TPC Summerlin — did it begin to sink in.“When I saw that I was leading by five, I said to myself, ‘Let’s not make a mistake and I can get this done,’” he said.By then, he had done all he needed. The 23-year-old South Korean closed with four safe pars for a 9-under 62 and a four-shot victory over Matthew Wolff in the Shriners Children’s Open.“Very meaningful win,” Im said. “It was hard coming, but I think today how everything went, I think it was a gift from above. I played so well and I’m glad I got the win.”It was the best closing round by a winner in the Shriners Children’s Open since Smylie Kaufman shot 61 in 2016. Im finished at 24-under 260, matching the tournament record held by Webb Simpson (2013) and Ryan Moore (2012).Wolff was trying to keep pace when he turned trouble into a birdie on the par-5 ninth with an 18-foot putt. But he was slowed by two tee shots that wound up in the worst of spots and led to bogeys he couldn’t afford.Wolff made a pair of late birdies for a 68 — he’s now 12 for 12 with rounds in the 60s at Summerlin — and had to settle for a runner-up finish.Im was among four players who had at least a share of the lead on the front nine of the TPC Summerlin on an ideal day of scoring with little wind.When he holed a 12-foot birdie putt on the sixth hole, the third-toughest on the course, to tie for the lead, Im was just getting started.He closed out the front nine with a simple up-and-down short of the green on the par-5 ninth to take the lead, then ran off four more birdies, the best of that lot on No. 10 when he went from a fairway bunker to 25 feet and made the putt.“The lie was not great with the lip in front, but I got it up on the green and to make that putt for a birdie, I think that kind of gave me great confidence that I can get this done,” he said.Im won for the second time on the PGA Tour, and while he’s not big into numbers, he couldn’t ignore the bizarre trend. He won the Honda Classic in 2020 in his 50th start on the PGA Tour. He won in Las Vegas in his 100th start.Odds are he won’t have to wait 50 more tournaments for his next trophy.He followed his victory in the Honda Classic with a third-place finish at Bay Hill, and then golf took a three-month hiatus because of the pandemic. He went five months without seriously contending again until the Masters in November, where he briefly challenged Dustin Johnson.Now, he can only hope he’s about to hit his stride.“I was on a really good roll and I was feeling great about my game after the Honda win and I played well in the Arnold Palmer as well the week following it,” Im said. “But it is unfortunate. It’s something that I couldn’t control. But after the pandemic, when golf was resumed, I really tried to find that rhythm again and there were times that was not easy.“But, again, try to stay composed and believe in my game.”Rory Sabbatini, the Olympic silver medalist from Slovakia, shot 28 on the front nine and was briefly tied for the lead. He could only manage even par on the back nine for a 64 and tied for third with Marc Leishman (63) and 54-hole leader Adam Schenk (70).For Wolff, there wasn’t much he could do but smile.“This game is like, when I’m in the lead or contention, someone just seems to go off the last day on me,” he said. One example would be Bryson DeChambeau shooting 67 in the final round at Winged Foot while playing in the final group with Wolff in the U.S. Open last year.“But if I keep on putting myself in these positions I know that eventually it’s going to be in my favor and I’m going to win,” he said.Sunday wasn’t that day, especially on the par-5 13th. He figured his 3-wood could easily clear the bunker on the left. And when it didn’t, he assumed it would roll back to the bottom of the sand and he still would have a reasonable chance at birdie.Instead, he said someone left the rake at the top and the ball came to rest on a slope in an indentation left by the handle. All he could was get it out some 15 feet. Even with a good lie, catching Im was going to be tough.Sam Burns, coming off a win last week in Mississippi and only two back starting the final round, made an early birdie and then stalled until it was too late. He finished with a double bogey for a 72 and tied for 14th."

4753226777,http://www.breitbart.com/news/ecb-under-fire-from-germany-set-to-defend-independence/,"ECB, under fire from Germany, set to defend independence","Frankfurt (AFP) – The European Central Bank, increasingly under fire in Germany over its ultra-loose monetary policies, will likely go out of its way to defend its independence at next week’s governing council meeting, analysts said.ECB president Mario Draghi “will respond to German politicians’ recent criticism … by reiterating the bank’s independence and stressing that more support is still possible,” said Capital Economics economist Jennifer McKeown.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has been unusually frank about his growing displeasure at the ECB’s decision to slash interest rates to zero, suggesting that the policies were helping foment political unrest in Europe’s biggest economy and aiding the rise of an anti-euro, anti-immigrant party, the AfD.German governments have traditionally steered away from commenting on ECB decisions so as not to be perceived to be trying to meddle with the central bank’s independence.But record low interest rates are squeezing German banks’ profits and also hurting the country’s savers, and political figures are now speaking out.Last week, Schaeuble was quoted in media reports as saying: “I told Mario Draghi: be very proud — you can attribute 50 percent of the results of a party that seems to be new and successful in Germany to the design of this (monetary) policy.”The AfD party was originally launched as an anti-euro platform, but has subsequently adopted a populist xenophobic message, on the back of which it made large gains in regional elections last month.The ECB is battling to push up the rate of inflation in the single currency area to levels it considers compatible with healthy economic growth and insists its mandate must only take into account the single currency area as a whole, not individual countries.– Unexpected allies –The spat has led some unexpected allies to rally around Draghi.French Finance Minister Michel Sapin leapt to the central bank’s defence.“France has learned, with difficulty, that the ECB’s independence must be respected absolutely and completely,” he said, urging Germany to show the same restraint it had so frequently preached to it and other countries in the past.“The Germans mustn’t lose their good habits,” Sapin said. “Our German friends” should remember that they themselves had always stressed the need for the ECB to be independent, he added.Even Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, also an outspoken critic of the ECB’s policies, joined in the fray.“It’s not unusual for politicians to have opinions on monetary policy, but we are independent,” he said.“The ECB has to deliver on its price stability mandate and thus an expansionary monetary policy stance is appropriate at this juncture regardless of different views about specific measures.”Weidmann, who has himself often been at loggerheads with Draghi over the ECB’s response to the threat of deflation in the euro area, argued that the debate in Germany focused too narrowly on the consequences of low interest rates for savers.“The debate does not focus enough on the broader macroeconomic consequences of monetary policy. People are not just savers: they’re also employees, taxpayers, and debtors, as such benefiting from the low level of interest rates,” the Bundesbank chief said.ECB watchers said Draghi, never one to allow himself to be put under pressure, would use the news conference to assert the bank’s independence.“We doubt very much that the ECB will be swayed by political pressure,” said McKeown at Capital Economics.Draghi would “fiercely defend ECB independence. If anything, previous experience suggests that he might strike an even more dovish tone than before to make the point that the bank is not open to political influence,” she said.– Draghi on German TV? –But the business daily Handelsblatt suggested Draghi might reach out to politicians and the public in Germany.It said Draghi’s advisors are considering putting him on TV in Germany “and there’s also talk of him visiting Berlin to talk to lawmakers.”The last time Draghi addressed the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, was in 2012.Given the large array of measures the ECB announced at its last meeting in March, no further policy action is on the cards just yet, analysts said.Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert suggested that the latest results of the Survey of Professional Forecasters — which quizzes analysts about their forecasts for growth and inflation — could help flag up the timing of any new policy moves.But IHS Global Insight Howard Archer also said the ECB would “now likely remain in ‘wait-and-see’ mode for an extended period.”"

Prosecutors said, however, some of those vehicles had been in need of repair before the storm.FEMA ultimately agreed to replace 132 department vehicles, which cost millions, a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office in New York City said.“Today’s settlement is the successful outcome of a joint investigation … which uncovered falsified submissions by the city to the federal government that allowed the city to wrongly obtain millions of dollars in federal emergency funds,” Margaret Garnett, commissioner of the New York City Department of Investigation, said in a statement Wednesday.“Our investigation found that a lack of vigilant management and inadequate training of city personnel at the Department of Transportation led to this wrongdoing in connection with a federal public assistance program.”The New York City area and many other locations in the Northeast received severe damage from the Category 3 hurricane in October 2012. All told, the storm caused nearly $70 billion in damages, making it the fourth-costliest hurricane in U.S. history.Transportation spokesman Scott Gastel told The New York Times the department cooperated with federal prosecutors when it became aware of the fraudulent claims in 2016.“NYC DOT has already instituted stronger procedures to reduce the risk of this ever happening again, including a new grants compliance officer and a centralized, comprehensive tracking system for the agency’s thousands of fleet vehicles,” Gastel said.Under the terms of the agreement, the city will pay back more than $5.3 million and relinquish an additional $1.7 million that had been promised to the city.“When people lie to FEMA about the cause of property damage in order to reap a windfall, it compromises FEMA’s ability to provide financial assistance to legitimate disaster victims in desperate need,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said. “This office will take decisive enforcement action to protect FEMA and its vital programs from fraud, waste, and abuse.”"

5397134017,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA4JV0202,Conn. mulls death certificate limits after Newtown,"(AP) Conn. mulls death certificate limits after NewtownBy SUSAN HAIGHAssociated PressHARTFORD, Conn.A town clerk told Connecticut legislators Friday that she’s been inundated with requests for copies of death certificates of Newtown school shooting victims and believes much of that information should not be released to the public.Town Clerk Debbie Aurelia said she’s concerned certain details on the documents, such as a mother’s maiden name or a cemetery name, could be misused by identity thieves or used by the media and others to contact family members during their time of grief.“They want to know where the victims are buried and how they died,” she told members of the General Assembly’s Government Administration and Elections Committee on Friday. “This is an extreme invasion of privacy.”Aurelia said she knows of families who have been threatened and intimidated since the Dec. 14 massacre, which left 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School dead. But Aurelia told The Associated Press that her office has not yet released any requested death certificates.Rep. Dan Carter, a Republican whose district includes a part of Newtown, proposed the bill discussed at Friday’s public hearing. It would exempt the death certificates of minors from public disclosure for 10 years, although he said he supports releasing a portion of the information.“I don’t want to see in a year from now, B-roll footage of a kid’s grave from Newtown,” he said. “That’s one of those things. We look at this and we go, why do people really need that part of it from a public standpoint?”According to Department of Public Health Commissioner Jewel Mullen, Connecticut is one of only a handful of states that allow unrestricted access to death records. She said most states restrict public access to the entire death certificate, redact some information or provide something called a certification of death, which is a separate document that only includes the name of the dead person and the date and place of their death.Aurelia wants all death certificates exempt from public disclosure without time limits, but she said she would be willing to release an abridged document that includes some information such as the name, gender, date and time of death, city of death and the manner of death, such as homicide or suicideShe said she doesn’t want to release the immediate cause of death, such as multiple gunshot wounds, or details such as where the person is buried, whether the body was embalmed and the mother’s maiden name.Two other public records bills have been raised during Connecticut’s legislative session this year that stem from the Newtown shooting.One calls for withholding the death certificate of a child from the public if such a disclosure would cause undue hardship for the child’s family. The other would make sure personal identifying information is not included in both death and marriage certificates when requested by members of the public who are not associated with the family, the funeral home making arrangements or the deceased person’s physician.Open records advocates and genealogists oppose such efforts.Robert Rafford, a professional genealogist from Middlebury, said he’s inspected thousands of death certificates and has not seen any evidence that families could be harmed by releasing the information they contain. He said the proposals would severely restrict access to vital records.“If I thought for one solitary moment that enacting this unprecedented legislation would be of help to the families in our state, I would unhesitatingly support it,” said Rafford, a retired marriage and family therapist. “But there is no benefit to be gained by depriving our citizens of a right they have exercised for four centuries. None, whatsoever.”In written testimony, the state’s Freedom of Information Commission said it was sympathetic to the desire to protect the families of deceased minors but said most sensitive information surrounding any death is already exempt form mandatory disclosure. The most graphic information is contained in autopsy reports, which are largely unavailable to the general public, the commission said.Both the commission and the Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information raised concerns about the proposal to withhold the death certificates of minors for 10 years. Each group brought up the issue of children dying in state custody and the importance of that information being public.“Death certificates are critical in reporting and research on a wide variety of legal and public health issues,” said Claude Albert, legislative chair of the council, in submitted testimony. “In addition, this bill makes no provision for the cases of children who die in state custody, which must always be subject to close public scrutiny.”"

But its untamed wilderness and abundant wildlife attract thousands of hunters, sport fisherman and campers each year.And recent resource development pressures have caused a rift among its few inhabitants, with fears of disastrous environmental damage to this unspoiled environment pitted against hopes for new jobs in an economically depressed region.The Canadian province of Quebec and Maurel et Prom have committed a total of Can$100 million initially to fund the search for energy resources due to begin mid-2014.They will be helped by juniors Corridor Resources and Petrolia, which hold exploration licenses on the island and have agreed to transfer them to the joint venture in exchange for shares.The exploration work involving drilling of a dozen and a half test wells is expected to continue over the following two years.The island is believed to hold an estimated 30 billion to 40 billion barrels of oil.The partnership is hoping to earn up to Can$74 billion over 30 years."

Eisenhower and another U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf. The images show fighter planes parked on the carrier deck.Tasnim did not identify the vessels or say when the drone footage was shot, but in the video, the number “69” is seen clearly on the aircraft carrier.The U.S. Navy begs to differ as to the time and place of the vision capture.“The footage the Iranians recently released… appears to be several years old, and of the last deployment to the Arabian Gulf by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69),” Lt. Chloe Morgan, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command spokesperson, told AFP in an email.Iran’s Tasnim news agency said the disputed footage was shot by a military drone (IRIB TV/AFP).The development comes after the U.S. government earlier this monthdesignatedthe Guard as a terrorist group to increase pressure on Iran and further isolate the country. “The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization, but none of us should be fooled,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.In 2016, Iran’s navy similarly took video footage of the nuclear-powered carrier USS Harry Truman, based in Norfolk, Virginia, while it was in the Persian Gulf region launching airstrikes and supporting operations against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.AFP contributed to this reportFollow Simon Kent on Twitter:Follow @SunSimonKentor e-mail to: skent@breitbart.com"

If the guy was crazy enough, he could’ve maybe hurt my children,” he told WTKR.Ryan showed reporters the broken doorframe on his patio door and said he thinks when it fell to the ground, that was the moment one of his daughters realized something was wrong.“I think when he popped this off and it fell… it scared my daughter that was sitting on the couch,” he said.Ryanbelievesthe suspects jumped on top of their blue recycling bin and climbed over the fence to enter the backyard.“There were a bunch of cop cars here already, the K-9 unit was here, police helicopter was flying overhead,” Ryansaid, adding that his was the only break-in he knew of in the area.However, Ryan’s eldest daughter, Kelly, said their half-lab, half-pit rescue dog named Penelope scared the burglars away with her fierce bark.“I was shocked. I really thought she would just lick the guy to death,” Ryan said of the brave animal.So far, police have found no fingerprints matching those that were discovered on the doorframe of the family’s home.Despite the attempted break-in, Ryansaidtheir family is doing alright and noted that he feels much better knowing that Penelope is around to keep them safe.“Unbelievably surprising and rewarding to know that you have a dog that did that.

1139898718,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA51MS5G5,US to beef up missile defense against NKorea,"(AP) US to beef up missile defense against NKoreaBy ROBERT BURNSAP National SecurityWASHINGTONThe Obama administration will add 14 interceptors to a West Coast-based missile defense system, reflecting concern about North Korea’s focus on developing nuclear weapons and its advances in long-range missile technology, officials said FridayDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel planned to announce the decision later Friday. It was first reported by Fox News.In advance of Hagel’s announcement, defense officials confirmed the decision on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.The Pentagon intends to add the 14 interceptors to 30 already in place at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., and Fort Greely, Alaska. That will expand the system’s ability to shoot down long-range missiles in flight before they could reach U.S. territory.James Miller, defense undersecretary for policy, said in a speech Tuesday that the Pentagon has the ability to deploy up to 14 additional missile interceptors, “if needed.” He did not say in the speech that a decision had been made to do so.Miller also said the Pentagon is studying three alternative sites for deploying still more interceptors in the U.S., if needed. He said that would provide options for building an interceptor base on the East Coast or adding more interceptors in Alaska, “should either approach become necessary due to further future increases in the threat from Iran and North Korea.”The threat of a missile strike from North Korea was the rationale for building the missile defense sites in Alaska and California during the administration of President George W. Bush. Technical difficulties with the interceptors slowed the pace at which they were installed at Greely and Vandenberg.“Our policy is to stay ahead of the threat _ and to continue to ensure that we are ahead of any potential future Iranian or North Korean ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) capability,” Miller said in Tuesday’s speech.Miller noted that last December, North Korea launched a satellite into space, demonstrating its mastery of some of the same technologies required for development of an intercontinental ballistic missile.“Our concern about Pyongyang’s potential ICBM capability is compounded by the regime’s focus on developing nuclear weapons. North Korea’s third nuclear test last month is obviously a serious concern for all nations,” he said.North Korea recently threatened to reduce Seoul to a “sea of fire” and stage pre-emptive nuclear attacks on Washington.“North Korea’s shrill public pronouncements underscore the need for the U.S. to continue to take prudent steps to defeat any future North Korean ICBM,” Miller said in his speech on Tuesday.___Follow Robert burns on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/robertburnsAP"

6802418829,https://www.breitbart.com/news/fbi-chief-reiterates-russia-meddled-whatever-putin-trump-say/,"FBI chief reiterates: Russia meddled, whatever Putin & Trump say","Washington (AFP) – FBI director Christopher Wray said Wednesday that the US intelligence community stands by its view that Russia interfered in the 2016 US election, despite Vladimir Putin’s denial this week to President Donald Trump.“He’s got his view, he has expressed his view,” Wray said when asked about Putin’s denial to Trump at their summit in Helsinki on Monday.“The intelligence community’s assessment has not changed. My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and that it continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.”Those acts “aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,” he added.On Monday, Trump appeared to accept Putin’s denial in a press conference after their meeting in Helsinki, sparking outrage in Washington and a rare statement of disagreement by the head of the US intelligence community, Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats.On Tuesday Trump walked back his comments, saying he accepted the view of US spies that Moscow had in fact meddled.“I accept our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place,” Trump said, reading a statement from the White House.Yet Trump continued to suggest doubts, adding: It “could be other people also; there’s a lot of people out there.”Wray, who was speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, also took issue with Trump’s suggestion on Wednesday that Russia has not continued to interfere this year as the United State prepares for congressional elections in November.Wray said that the FBI has not yet seen any specific actions targeting US election infrastructure — compared to 2016, when Russian hackers targeted voter registration and voting management computers across the country, according to US intelligence.“But certainly other efforts, what I would call malign influence operations, are very active. And we could be just a moment away from going to the next level,” he said.“For me, it’s a threat that we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.”Asked if he saw, like Trump, that other countries were involved, Wray said some countries would indeed try to influence US politics in various ways “going forward.”However, he added, “There is no question that Russia has been by far the most aggressive actor.”Wray also took issue with Trump’s repeated condemnations of the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion with Russia’s election meddling as groundless and politically motivated.“It’s not a witch hunt,” he said, using Trump’s words.Asked if, amid intense criticism of the FBI by Trump, he had threatened to resign in recent months, Wray declined to answer directly.In May 2017 Trump fired Wray’s predecessor, James Comey, after Comey refused to back off of the Russia probe.Wray implied that he, too, would not bow to unreasonable pressure.“I’m a low-key, understated guy. But that should not be mistaken for what my spine is made out of,” he said."

6081181292,http://www.breitbart.com/news/grace-mugabe-gets-diplomatic-immunity-returns-to-zimbabwe/,"Grace Mugabe gets diplomatic immunity, returns to Zimbabwe","HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Granted diplomatic immunity by South Africa, the wife of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe returned home from Johannesburg on Sunday despite calls that she be prosecuted for allegedly assaulting a young model at a luxury hotel there.Zimbabwean state broadcaster ZBC showed Grace Mugabe greeting government and military officials at the Harare airport after returning on an Air Zimbabwe plane with her husband, who had attended a summit of southern African leaders in Pretoria. The Mugabe couple did not attend a state funeral for a senior ruling party official later in the day in the Zimbabwean capital; the president usually presides over such events.South Africa’s foreign minister, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, granted immunity to Grace Mugabe in a government gazette notice that was published Sunday. Signed on Saturday, the notice recognizes “the immunities and privileges of the First Lady of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Dr. Grace Mugabe.”South African police had previously issued a “red alert” at borders to ensure she didn’t leave undetected and had said they were waiting for a government decision on the immunity appeal.The country’s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, called for a parliamentary inquiry into South Africa’s decision to let the Zimbabwean first lady leave and said on Twitter that the government has “no more legitimacy in the arena of international diplomacy and displays a total disregard for the rule of law.”John Steenhuisen, a senior opposition official, compared the South African handling of the Mugabe case to the government’s decision to allow Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to leave the country in 2015 even though he was wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, the African News Agency reported.Gabriella Engels, a 20-year-old model, said Grace Mugabe attacked her on Aug. 13, whipping her with an extension cord that cut her forehead.In reaction to the news that Mugabe had returned to Zimbabwe, a group representing Engels said Sunday it would go to court to challenge the South African government over the immunity issue.“We will take a long-term approach on this,” said Willie Spies, legal representative at AfriForum, an organization that primarily represents South Africa’s white Afrikaner minority.“She may be back in Zimbabwe, but it may mean that she will find it very difficult to come back to South Africa in the future,” Spies said.Zimbabwe’s state media have largely remained silent on the scandal over Zimbabwe’s first lady.The Zimbabwean president’s outspoken wife has been criticized for a fiery temper and lavish shopping expeditions, but her rising political profile has some asking whether she is maneuvering to succeed her husband. She recently said that Zimbabwe’s ruling party should restore a provision in its constitution stating that one of the party’s vice presidents should be a woman, and has publicly challenged her 93-year-old husband to name a successor.Also Sunday, one of Zimbabwe’s two vice presidents, Phelekezela Mphoko, presided over the funeral for Shuvai Ben Mahofa, a senior member of Zimbabwe’s ruling party who died a week ago.South African Airways, meanwhile, said Sunday — hours after the Mugabes returned to Harare— that it was resuming flights between South Africa and Zimbabwe after they were blocked by Zimbabwean authorities.Zimbabwe’s action on Saturday followed the grounding of an Air Zimbabwe flight at Johannesburg’s main international airport on Friday evening. That plane was cleared for flying on Saturday night, South African civil aviation authorities said. It was unclear whether the Mugabes used the same aircraft to return to Zimbabwe.Both countries said they had imposed restrictions because the affected planes did not have a “foreign operator’s permit.”South African Airways said it prepared and submitted required documents after the cancellation of flights between Johannesburg, Harare and the Zimbabwean city of Victoria Falls.The airline dispute had nothing to do with political tensions linked to the scandal over Grace Mugabe’s alleged assault, Zimbabwe’s transport minister, Joram Gumbo, told state media.Willie Spies, the lawyer representing the model who said she was assaulted, speculated that the airline impasse was a Zimbabwean ruse designed to distract attention from the first lady’s troubles.___Associated Press writer Christopher Torchia contributed to this report from Johannesburg."

Ahhh women,” he said in another post.The news site found he also wrote “Ungrateful ass b*tches,” “These hoes the same all they change is their outfits,” and “The next b*tch say I look like Drake getting slapped!”Guzman refused to respond to the Delaware Valley Journal, but hetoldthe PA Post, “Those tweets do not represent the values that I have today, nor do they represent the values that I will fight for as the first Latino from Reading to be elected to the PA House of Representatives.”He continued, “The truth is, there is no excuse for my words. I was young, ignorant, immature and — like a lot of young people — did not consider the impact my words would have.”Guzman said he wanted to “apologize to my mother, grandmother, my sister, and all the women who have supported me in my life.”“You don’t talk about women like that — plain and simple,” Guzman’s opponent, Vincent Gagliardo Jr. (R), responded,according totheReading Eagle. “People who have that mentality shouldn’t be running for office. He’s a child in a man’s body.”Guzman locked his Twitter account after the exposure, preventing anyone from browsing his other musings.Meanwhile, Guzman isn’t the only Democrat candidate to disparage women.Michigan state Rep.

Fred Upton (R), wrote at least one blog in the mid-2000s in which he referred to women as “breeders.” Hoadley is gay.He wrote, “Jen, Liz, and I made it to the straight bars.

6870784768,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/08/23/report-tesla-cars-being-delivered-with-flaws/,Report: Tesla Cars Being Delivered with Flaws,"According to recent reports, some vehicles from Elon Musk’s Tesla are being delivered with severe flaws that customers are finding difficult to have repaired.Business Insiderreportsthat over the course of two months, the publication spoke with 12 different Tesla car owners who described a multitude of issues with the vehicles. Nearly all of those interviewed said that they loved the car when it worked properly, but that since receiving it they had been forced to deal with a number of persistent problems. These include some problems that began happening on the day the car was delivered, and the customers have found getting Tesla to deal with the issues was not as easy as they had expected.Recent leaks from Tesla haverevealedthat only 14 percent of cars pass the company’s first inspection, the rest need rework to be considered ready for customers. Industry experts consider 80 percent to be a good target for automobile manufacturers. Based on the Business Insider report, not all of the cars requiring rework are actually properly fixed before being delivered to customers.Customers interviewed were split on Tesla’s customer service, some found the service timely and efficient, while others said the company was slow, unresponsive and ignored many cosmetic and mechanical issues that their customers faced.  When asked for comment, a Tesla spokesperson stated: “While we’re incredibly proud of the customer support and service we offer, we’re always working to improve.”One customer, Dennis Phillips, received his Model 3 car in May. Only two days after receiving the car he noticed what appeared to be the head of a nail sticking out of the roof of the vehicle. Phillips called Tesla and said the employee that he spoke with was “arrogant” and insisted that Tesla had not noticed any cosmetic damage on the car before it was delivered. Philips insisted otherwise, noting that on the day he took the car home he noticed a razor blade in the back seat. “This is not something I could possibly have done,” said Phillips when discussing the nail sticking out of the car.Phillips took his car to the Dedham service center for repair and was told it would take two to three days. After a week, the car was ready to be picked up. But Phillips’ issues haven’t ended there, since then he’s noticed further cosmetic damage, brake sticking when driving in reverse, and the car’s touchscreen regularly refusing to activate when starting the car. “At what point is your brand-new car not a brand-new car anymore?” he said.Sultan Meghji, another Tesla customer, ordered his Model S in May and was told it would arrive by June 23, but Meghji didn’t receive his car until August 2. After finally receiving the car, Meghji drove the vehicle for less than a block before he realized that the car was not properly aligned. “I drive off the lot and my alignment is so far out of whack that I can barely drive,” he said. “I straighten the wheel and I almost run into a bush on the right side of the road.” Meghji drove the car to the service center but was told that he would have to keep the vehicle for four days until his repair appointment.Some Tesla owners are facing worse issues than others. A Tesla Model Scaught fireon a highway in New Jersey earlier this week after a component fell off a truck and hit the car. According to Tesla, the car collided with a suspension component from an 18-wheeler which caused the car to lift off the road and crash back down. The driver managed to maneuver the car to the side of the road and exited the vehicle. Tesla claims that the driver was “happy” with how the car “kept him safe” before it burst into flames. Tesla said in a statement:The owner of this vehicle reported to us that his Model S collided with a large suspension component that fell from an 18-wheeler truck, causing the Model S to be partially lifted off of the road and resulting in loss of control of the vehicle. He was able to safely get himself and his possessions out of the car before there was any fire. He told us how happy he was that the car kept him safe even though the impact was so severe.Serious crashes like this can result in fire regardless of the type of car, and based on our fleet of over 300,000 cars, which have driven over 7.5 billion miles, we know that a Tesla vehicle is at least 10 times less likely to experience a fire than a gas car.Tesla cars have faced a number of road issues, some relating to the Tesla autopilot system which was reportedly in use when a Teslahit a fire engineat 65 miles per hour in January.Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

6704085657,http://www.breitbart.com/news/education-department-sued-over-dismissal-of-civil-rights-complaints/,Education Department sued over dismissal of civil rights complaints,"May 31 (UPI) — A group of three national civil rights organizations sued the Department of Education for new procedures that allow it to dismiss hundreds of civil rights complaints.The National Federation of the Blind, the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Maryland against the department Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Candice Jackson.The groups requested a judge block the department from enforcing new provisions in the Office for Civil Rights Case Processing Manual, allowing it to dismiss complaints if they represent “a pattern of complaints previously filed with OCR by an individual or a group against multiple recipients,” or complaints “filed for the first time against multiple recipients” that place “an unreasonable burden on OCR’s resources.”The change also eliminates a complainant’s right to appeal a claim.The lawsuit argues the Education Department was “arbitrary and capricious” in changing the manual in March without notifying the public, giving an explanation or providing a chance to comment.“Obviously, we abhor meritless civil rights complaints, but whether a complaint is actually meritorious should be determined by proper investigation,” the National Federation of the Blind said in a statement. “There is no good reason for OCR to ignore a complaint simply because the complainant has rightfully challenged discrimination before. That approach denies due process to those who bring complaints in good faith and flouts the anti-discrimination laws that OCR is supposed to enforce.”The lawsuit also notes that civil rights complaints are regularly filed by people who are victims of discrimination or groups that represent them and that the manual contains no definition for a “pattern.”“The ban on complaints from persons or entities who have made complaints in the past or complaints against multiple recipients of federal funds directly contradicts the DOE regulations requiring that all complaints be investigated,” the complaint states. “Neither regulations nor statutes empower DOE’s OCR to limit the complaints that will be investigated in this fashion.”"

Police are working to ID victims,” interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqui said on Twitter.A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the attack on social media, claiming it was “against the forces of aggression” in Afghanistan.The bombing, carried out by a suicide bomber on foot according to police, occurred just before 6:00 am (0130 GMT) in the east of the Kabul along the main road to the eastern city of Jalalabad.It was the first attack in the capital since the start of the holy fasting month of Ramadan two weeks ago.The last attack in the Afghan capital on April 19 left 64 dead and more than 340 wounded.That attack was also claimed by the Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency against the Western-backed Kabul government since they were ousted from power by a US-led invasion in late 2001.Washington recently announced an expansion of the US military’s authority to conduct air strikes against the Taliban, significantly boosting Afghan forces who have limited close air-support capacities.US forces have been in an advisory role in Afghanistan since the start of 2015 and were only authorised to hit Taliban targets for defensive reasons, or to protect Afghan soldiers.The changes mean US troops can now work more closely with local fighters in striking the Taliban, who have demanded the departure of all foreign forces."

Sam Kinison was a genius for his time and theoretically still is. The Pentecostal preacher-turned-comedian took a would-be sermon and used his thunderous delivery, vendi-quadruple espresso shot-energy and viewpoint of the obvious to pontificate some of the funniest bits that the 80’s and very early 90’s had ever heard. While his peers, comprised of Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Reiser, and Rosanne Barr, were humorously talking about not pulling the tag off the mattress, catching tuna and not dolphins, and refusing to vacuum until Sears made one you could ride, Sam’s mind worked on other angles that today would have put him on a Hate List somewhere  between Sarah Palin and Pat Boone.His great bitabout world hunger, that  there would be no world hunger if starving Africans “lived where the food is and not in the desert where nothing grows,” in 2010 would have been construed as anti-Muslim, since Muslims live in the desert. Sam likely would’ve been exiled likeJyllands-Posten, the Danish cartoonists. Then there’s Kinison’srapper bitwhich would have no doubt caused Kayne West to tweet “Sam Kinison hates black people” and then bag out on some a previous commitment ala theToday Show. Kinison’sbit on Rock Hudsonwas spewed not with malice but with a mix of commentary about a screen idol keeping one of Hollywood’s biggest secrets and how heterosexual men may view a gay sexual experience. That bit today would have created blogs upon websites blaring on how Sam is a homophobe and one of the causes  of bullying.Clearly Sam was not without his well-documented personal problems and had many demons he struggled with, but his comedy was straightforward, poignant and his subject matter was that of what many people where thinking about with their inside voice, all of which are the elements of being one of the greatest comics of your time.I think Sam Kinison certainly would have been a working comic today. However, I do not think he would have had nearly the impact or fame that he experienced during  his short life. He would have found his audience and hence a following across the country, but I truly believe the entertainment industry would have not wanted to touch him for the fear of   a PC Police backlash. I can’t imagine a Comedy Central or even a HBO that today would have given a one hour special to a stand-up who would exclaim, “If you can’t make it in this country, you can’t make it anywhere. This is   the greatest country in the world.” Especially if that proclamation is followed  a hystericalshooting the homeless bit.I’m glad Sam lived in the era he did so we’re now  able to reap the benefits of his brilliance. But what a great show it would have been to see Sam go at it with Bill Maher, if that ever could have been a reality.Thanks for the laughs Sam, I’m glad you brought them when you did."

During the performance, which includes a mock procession, actors distribute leaflets to the audience with a prayer to “Our Lady of the Transvestites” and sing parodies of Catholic hymns, inviting the audience to join in.“We demand and hope that the competent authorities and the organizers suspend the event, given that it is an indisputable encouragement to prejudice and discrimination, disrespectful of the values of the Catholic Christian faith,” the archdiocesan statement read.The archdiocese said that the event was “seriously endangering the peace and the proper respectful relationship between citizens.”It is “not acceptable to exploit the Virgin Mary, disrespecting her” in order to promote “an aggression” against the Catholic faith, the text stated, while calling on all Catholics to “protest, demanding respect and the immediate suspension of this criminal action.”Along with the official statement from the archdiocese, an independent Catholic organization from Belo Horizonte called the Instituto Sao Pedro de Alcantara organized an online petition protesting the event, which garnered over 28,000 signatures.Just hours after the release of the Church statement, the mayor of Belo Horizonte, Alexandre Kalil, announced the cancelation of the show, which had been scheduled to be performed on July 20 in a taxpayer-funded cultural festival organized by the city government.Kalil posted the news on his Twitteraccount: “I defend all liberties. I’m a Catholic, devoted to Saint Rita of Cascia. Don’t worry, nobody will attack any religion. This is not culture.”The theatrical company posted its ownstatementon Facebook, alleging that the show does not intend to “deny the faith of other people” and suggesting that it does not mock the Catholic Church. The group also accused the local government of censorship for cancelling the performance.“This is not Our Lady, the Mother of Jesus, but another Lady, our transvestite, a lady that is daily excluded from society (she is looked at with horror and contempt), from the world of arts and culture (she is condemned never to have ideas or opinions), from the economy (only prostitution is left for her), from the streets (except for the corners where there is prostitution), and from religion (as if she was not part of the bigger mystery of life),” the group said.Follow @tdwilliamsrome"

A memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date. The family requests privacy during their time of grief.”Cohen released his 14th album, “You Want it Darker,” on October 21 to widely positive reviews, and caught the world off guard a week later when he told The New Yorker he was “ready to die” — a statement he backed off of during a concert after the interview came out.“Uh, I said I was ready to die recently,” Cohen told an audience during a listening party in Los Angeles for the new album. “And I think I was exaggerating. I’ve always been into self-dramatization. I intend to live forever.”Cohen came to prominence in the late 1960s after abandoning a career dedicated only literature, turning instead to poetry and songwriting when he moved to New York City. His 1967 debut album became a cult hit, and with his second album, “Songs for a Room,” unleashed one of his most revered and covered songs, “Bird on the Wire.”Throughout the decades that followed, Cohen released 12 more albums which included emotional, often dark, takes on love, life, success and failure. He may be best known for the song “Hallelujuah,” a meditation of harsh self-examination and pleading for forgiveness."

1868562215,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA9G1OS00,Review: New 'Skylanders' divide and conquer,"(AP) Review: New ‘Skylanders’ divide and conquerBy LOU KESTENAssociated PressAs Activision’s Skylanders franchise has exploded in popularity, more parents have asked me: Is it as cool as it looks, or just an insidious plot to separate my kids from their allowances?Who says it can’t be both?Look, collectible toys have been around for most of our lifetimes, whether we’re talking about Barbie fashions, Matchbox cars or Beanie Babies. The genius of Skylanders is in bringing those toys to life through something else kids love: the video-game console.For the uninitiated: Skylanders are accompanied by a game disk and a “Portal of Power” that plugs into your Xbox, PlayStation or Wii. When you place a Skylander figurine on the portal, the character materializes in the video game.The wrinkle in the new “Skylanders Swap Force” is that some of the creatures snap in two, and you can freely replace their tops and bottoms. The most widely available starter kit (for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, $74.99) comes with Wash Buckler, a sword-wielding octopus, and Blast Zone, a bomb-throwing robot. Switch their parts and you get two new characters, Wash Zone and Blast Buckler. You can do this with all 16 Swap Force Skylanders, which means a total of 256 new characters.In addition, each of the Swap Force models has one of eight skills, like climbing, bouncing or teleporting. Finally, there’s a whole new batch of one-piece Skylanders; the starter kit comes with Ninja Stealth Elf.The obsessive collector needs to start saving up; the Swap Force figurines cost $15 apiece and the regular Skylanders go for $10, so it’s pretty easy to crack $500. But you can survive the game’s story mode with just the three characters in the starter kit. You can also use any of the Skylanders that have been released since the franchise debuted in 2011.The game itself is the series’ best so far. The story is the usual silliness: Recurring villain Kaos is bent on destroying the Skylands and it’s up to you and your companions to stop him. The journey takes you across a series of well-designed environments, from snow-covered mountains to the inside of a volcano. There are monsters to fight, puzzles to solve and treasures to collect, and you can spend all your loot on buying new powers for your favorite Skylanders.Vicarious Visions, the studio behind “Swap Force,” has given all the characters one new ability: They can now jump. That simple addition opens up a whole range of activity, seemingly drawn from every kid-friendly game since “Super Mario Bros.” Yes, there’s plenty of running and jumping, but you’ll also find yourself zipping along rails, manning turrets, navigating mazes and fishing. Certain areas, which you need particular Skylanders to unlock, provide some of the game’s toughest challenges.Like the previous “Skylanders” games, “Swap Force” is a delight for parents and kids to play together. You can team up on the story levels or enjoy a robust collection of bonus challenges, both cooperative and competitive. Indeed, there’s so much to do in “Swap Force” that it should take months for even the most dedicated player to discover all its secrets.Sure, the brand has become a cash cow for Activision, but it doesn’t feel exploitive, thanks to the high quality of the games and the toys. I’ve even developed a bit of affection for some of the Skylanders who have taken over my living room, and I’m looking forward to seeing where they’ll go next. Three-and-a-half stars out of four.___Follow Lou Kesten on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lkesten___Online:http://www.skylanders.com/"

The headstock has “B.B. King 80” and a crown inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The guitar is estimated to be worth $80,000 to $100,000.The guitar was not the first to bear the name. The story goes that King first used that moniker for a guitar he rescued from a fire while he was playing an Arkansas club in 1949. The blaze broke out as two men fought over a woman, and the musician narrowly escaped death after he went back into the club to save his guitar, the auction house said.When King learned the woman’s name was Lucille, he named his guitar after her “to remind himself to never fight over a woman or run into a burning building,” the auction house said.The National Medal of Arts that President George H.W. Bush presented to King in 1990 is also up for auction. So are his touring van, jewelry and clothing.The 15-time Grammy winner was 89 when he died in 2015."
4952225679,http://www.breitbart.com/news/critics-bill-favoring-heterosexual-parents-unconstitutional/,Critics: Bill favoring heterosexual parents unconstitutional,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Legislation that would require Utah judges to favor heterosexual couples over same-sex couples in adoptions or foster care placements is blatantly unconstitutional and won’t hold up in court, according to gay rights advocates.Rep. Kraig Powell, R-Heber City, said Friday that last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage doesn’t stop Utah from keeping a preference in state law that a child have a married mother and father.Powell said his bill would not apply to private adoptions and would only involve children in state custody.In those cases, he said a judge would “follow what’s been traditional and proven in society, that there’s a father and a mother and that gender diversity will be a broadening experience for the child.”Powell said a same-sex couple would be given preference in an adoption or foster placement if they had a relationship with the child, such as being family members or neighbors.Powell said he’s still working with state child welfare officials to figure out exactly how his idea would play out. He didn’t know if it would put gay couples at the bottom of waiting lists for children who are wards of the state or if officials would have to show they first searched for a heterosexual couple before placing a child with a gay couple.He said it won’t stop gay couples from having or adopting children. He said his bill also would tweak existing laws about surrogacy and artificial insemination to make it easier for gay couples to have children those ways.Equality Utah Executive Director Troy Williams said Powell’s proposal is clearly unconstitutional.“Gay parents have equal protection now under the law,” he said. “Any effort by Rep. Powell to roll back the rights and liberties of LGBT Utahns will be met with fierce resistance from our community.”Williams cited the backlash from a case last fall, in which a small-town Utah judge ordered a foster child be removed from a lesbian couple and placed with a heterosexual couple.The judge cited the child’s well-being as the reason for his order, but after an intense outcry and concerns from state welfare officials, the judge reversed his decision and took himself off the case.The Supreme Court ruling did not explicitly address the issue that Powell is raising but did declare that same-sex couples have a right to marriage and all the rights and benefits enjoyed by married heterosexual couples, said Douglas NeJaime, faculty director of the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.He said that when it comes to adoptions, the law allows judges a limited ability to consider things like marital status. But a blanket preference for married heterosexual couples over married gay couples is very likely unconstitutional, NeJaime said.Another Utah lawmaker has a proposal opposing Powell’s that would ensure all married couples are treated equally in adoptions or foster placements.The bill from state Rep. Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, would change Utah’s adoption laws favoring a married man and woman to the words “couple” or “spouse.”“I just want to ensure that all families have the same rights,” Romero said. “We have different formations of families, and I think it’s important to acknowledge that these different formations are healthy and that we should embrace all of our community.”She declined to comment on Powell’s bill, saying she hasn’t seen it yet. Powell said his proposal will be released in about a week."
6644426043,http://www.breitbart.com/news/turkey-uzbekistan-boost-ties-with-3bn-deals/,"Turkey, Uzbekistan boost ties with $3bn deals","Tashkent (AFP) – The leaders of Turkey and Uzbekistan on Monday signed deals worth $3 billion (2.5 billion euros), as the two countries seek to boost ties.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underlined the “common values” shared by Ankara and Tashkent, during a three-day visit to the former Soviet Central Asian republic.He said trade between the nations rose  by 30 percent to 1.5 billion dollars in 2017.“Turkish businessmen plan to invest in Uzbekistan, which presents big opportunities for them,” Erdogan said at a joint press conference with his Uzbek counterpart Shavkat Mirziyoyev in the capital Tashkent.The two leaders signed deals including on transport, energy and tourism “as part of more than 50 investment projects worth $3 billion dollars”, Mirziyoyev said in a statement released by his office.Uzbekistan will also join the Cooperation Council of Turkic-Speaking States, the two leaders said.Erdogan’s last visit was in November 2016, shortly after the death of Uzbekistan’s first president, long-reigning Islam Karimov.Karimov had been famously hostile towards other countries in the region, even threatening war with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan over water disputes in 2012.Tensions also simmered with Ankara, which Karimov accused of harbouring opponents of his government."
9708019017,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2023/05/24/peter-schweizer-the-new-york-times-misrepresents-its-own-reporting/,Peter Schweizer: The New York Times Misrepresents Its Own Reporting,"On the most recent episode of their podcast,The Drill Down, Peter Schweizer and co-host Eric Eggers set the record straight.A pair ofstoriesappearingin theNew York Timesrecently revealed that the FBI had contacted Schweizer in 2015 about allegations in his NYT bestsellingClinton Cash: How Foreign Governments Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.Of particular interest to the Bureau was the sale of uranium assets to Russia, and any possible connection between that deal and the Clinton Foundation.TheTimesattempts to portray Schweizer’s work, and the FBI’s resultant investigations, as partisan efforts. Yet, as Schweizer and Eggers point out, theTimesitself corroborated Schweizer’s reporting on the Clinton Foundation with its own4,000-word front-page storyin 2015.“I’m just frustrated by the manner in which powerful forces try to misrepresent what we have done,” Schweizersays.Indeed, in its own 2015 blockbuster story, theTimesconfirmedthe basic facts of the Uranium One story GAI had reported, including the deep involvement of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her family’s charitable foundation, which took large amounts of cash from foreign businesses and governments for its charitable work while having pending business before the Department of State. TheTimescited material Schweizer provided to them just prior to the book’s publication. The FBI agents who called Schweizer asked for and were given copies of the corporate records GAI had found in its research.Unlike much of modern journalism, the work GAI did was all documented and sourced, with no anonymous attributions to “people familiar with the matter.”On thepodcast, Peter remembered that first 2015 contact from the FBI. “So, the FBI calls… They said, ‘Look, we’re interested in the work that you’ve done. Would you be willing to provide information if necessary?’ I said, ‘Sure. This is the mission of GAI.’” GAI provided the FBI with corporate and tax records it had gotten regarding the Clinton Foundation, which revealed undisclosed contributions from the Canadian mining concern that ultimately brokered the Uranium One deal.“We’re happy to share [the facts] because our mission is not only to tell the world what we found, but hopefully we want some justice on the tail end,” Schweizer says.The FBI then launched investigations involving four of its field offices, before the 2016 election, Schweizer says.In his recent report to Congress, Special Counsel John Durham noted that, inside the FBI, efforts to investigate the Clinton Foundation were blocked. Schweizer notes, “The FBI had taped recordings of four nationals talking about how you can give money to the Clintons and they’ll give you favors. There’s lots of evidence beyond the book. [FBI attorney] Lisa Page, she writes about the Clinton investigation in a text to Peter Strzok that said, ‘one more thing, Clinton may be our next president… the last thing you need is going in there loaded for bear.’ She goes on to say, you know, we really shouldn’t be looking at this.”It’s been established how deeply shaken Hillary Clinton’s campaign was by Schweizer’s reporting. Investigative reporter Jeff Gerth recently wrote a detailed, four-part exposé forthe Columbia Journalism Reviewrevealing the Clinton camp’s paranoia at the time. Hillary’s number one vulnerability, internal campaign polling had shown, was the uranium sale to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Gerth’s long investigative piece shows.Schweizer picks it up. “And then [Clinton’s] smart political people said, what if it’s actually Trump that has the Russia problem? Exactly. Classic move. You switch your chief vulnerability on your opponent.” This strategy, many observers have concluded, was the reason the Clinton campaign paid to produce the Steele Dossier and then fed its unsubstantiated rumors to the FBI, as the Durham report has now firmly documented.Citing the Durham Report, Schweizer noted the double standard between how the FBI decided to investigate the allegations of Russia collusion by Trump and its actions regarding the operations of the Bill and Hillary Clinton Foundation. The FBI sprang into action on the Trump case on the strength of the discredited Steele Dossier. The bureau bypassed or ignored its own internal standards for reviewing and corroborating raw intelligence to justify the Trump investigation.“Think about the Steele Dossier and the way in which the mainstream media outlets were used by the Clinton campaign by leveraging the credibility of the intelligence community to say, ‘here’s this story, here’s what we have.’ And they reported it breathlessly,” Schweizer says.And now former FBI officials, perhaps the very officials involved in stalling the Clinton investigation, are quoted anonymously by theTimesdisparaging those inquiries and the solid journalism that instigated them.“The New York Timesand mainstream media is still being used by the intelligence community,” Eggers says. “You would think that elements likeThe New York Timeswould realize how they’re being used in this manner, but apparently they don’t.”To listen to the Drill Down podcast – clickhere."

About being in a situation as a young adult where I felt bullied and how that has affected me, and molded me in a way,” Mel C told the magazine.“Unfortunately, being bullied can really damage people and even when you are stronger and over it, it can still be in the background — undermining you,” she confessed. “I hope people will identify with that track.”Mel C confirmed the bullying occurred during her years with the Spice Girls, but said she’s “not going to name names.” She and the person in question have reportedly put the matter to rest.“It’s been addressed, they were aware of what they’d done. They apologized,” the star revealed.“When we were kids we were so hard on each other and so determined to succeed that if anybody fell out of line they were quickly brought back in.

6377359884,http://www.breitbart.com/news/soaring-overdose-deaths-cut-us-life-expectancy-for-2nd-year-2/,Soaring overdose deaths cut US life expectancy for 2nd year,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. deaths from drug overdoses skyrocketed 21 percent last year, and for the second straight year dragged down how long Americans are expected to live.The government figures released Thursday put drug deaths at 63,600, up from about 52,000 in 2015.  For the first time, the powerful painkiller fentanyl and its close opioid cousins played a bigger role in the deaths than any other legal or illegal drug, surpassing prescription pain pills and heroin.“This is urgent and deadly,” said Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The opioid epidemic “clearly has a huge impact on our entire society.”Two-thirds of last year’s drug deaths — about 42,000 — involved opioids, a category that includes heroin, methadone, prescription pain pills like OxyContin, and fentanyl. Fatal overdoses that involved fentanyl and fentanyl-like drugs doubled in one year, to more than 19,000, mostly from illegally made pills or powder, which is often mixed with heroin or other drugs.Heroin was tied to 15,500 deaths and prescription painkillers to 14,500 deaths. The balance of the overdose deaths involved sedatives, cocaine and methamphetamines. More than one drug is often involved in an overdose death.The highest drug death rates were in ages 25 to 54.Preliminary 2017 figures show the rise in overdose deaths continuing.The drug deaths weigh into CDC’s annual calculation of the average time a person is expected to live. The life expectancy figure is based on the year of their birth, current death trends and other factors. For decades, it was on the upswing, rising a few months nearly every year. But last year marked the first time in more than a half century that U.S. life expectancy fell two consecutive years.A baby born last year in the U.S. is expected to live about 78 years and 7 months, on average, the CDC said. An American born in 2015 was expected to live about a month longer and one born in 2014 about two months longer than that.The dip in 2015 was blamed on drug deaths and an unusual upturn in the death rate for the nation’s leading killer, heart disease. Typically, life expectancy goes back up after a one-year decline, said Robert Anderson, who oversees the CDC’s death statistics. The last time there was a two-year drop was 1962-1963. It also happened twice in the 1920s.“If we don’t get a handle on this,” he said, “we could very well see a third year in a row. With no end in sight.”A three-year decline happened in 1916, 1917 and 1918, which included the worst flu pandemic in modern history.Overall, there were more than 2.7 million U.S. deaths in 2016, or about 32,000 more than the previous year. It was the most deaths in a single year since the government has been counting. That partly reflects the nation’s growing and aging population. But death rates last year continued to go down for people who are 65 and older while going up for all younger adults — those most affected by the opioid epidemic.The CDC also reported :—West Virginia continued to be the state with highest drug overdose death rate, with a rate of 52 deaths per 100,000 state residents in 2016. Ohio and New Hampshire were next, both at about 39 per 100,000.—Life expectancy for men decreased, but it held steady for women. That increased the gender gap to five years; about 76 for men and 81 for women.—U.S. death rates decreased for seven of the 10 leading causes of death, but rose for suicide, Alzheimer’s disease and for a category called unintentional injuries (which includes drug overdoses).—Accidental injuries displaced chronic lower respiratory diseases to become the nation’s third leading cause of death. Contributing were increases in deaths from car crashes and falls.—Gun deaths rose for a second year, to nearly 39,000. They had been hovering around 33,500 deaths a few years ago.The United States ranks below dozens of other high-income countries in life expectancy, according to the World Bank. Highest is Japan, at nearly 84 years.“The fact that U.S. has basically stagnated over the past seven years — and now we’re seeing small declines — is a real sign that the U.S. is doing badly,” said Jessica Ho, a University of Southern California researcher who studies death trends."

It has triggered sometimes violent protests by far-right groups.Because of privacy rules, the victim in the Kandel stabbing has been identified only as Mia and the migrant as Abdul D., who was also convicted of assault at the district court in Landau. The perpetrator’s nationality and his age couldn’t be confirmed with absolute certainty by authorities, but German media have reported that he is most likely Afghan and he was tried as a minor.Abdul D. said he was 15 at the time of the murder, but an age evaluation during the trial came to the conclusion that he was at least 17, dpa reported. Young asylum-seekers, especially unaccompanied minors, have more privileges and get better care in Germany than older asylum-seekers, which is why some of them lie about their age when they apply for asylum. The Kandel case, therefore, has also led for calls to better determine the age of migrants upon their arrival in Germany.The victim had ended the relationship with the migrant a few weeks before the murder, dpa reported. Twelve days before the fatal attack, she pressed charges against him including insult and threat. Prosecutors claimed during the trial that the migrant acted out of jealously and revenge and that he wanted to punish her.Far right groups used her killing to stage several protests against migrants in the small town near the French border -with pro-migrant counter-protests quickly following."

And it’s very high-bouncing as well. So, it’s more difficult than in other tournaments, so everybody has to kind of find their rhythm in the first match.“But at the end of the day it was a pretty good match. I’m happy to get the win. That’s the most important thing. It’s important — this tournament is big. It is very important to all of us players.”Zverev has long been talked about as one of the brightest talents of his generation and will be keen to make a statement in London after again flattering to deceive at Grand Slam level this season.Federer lost to Nishikori in straight sets in the Lleyton Hewitt group on Sunday, leaving him in grave danger of failing to qualify for the semi-finals for only the second time in his career.The ATP Finals are contested by the eight players who have accumulated the most ranking points over the season and is in a round-robin format, with the best four players reaching the knockout semi-finals stage."

And Sweden, which will assume the presidency of the UN Security Council in January,intendsto bring its own resolution slamming Israeli settlements.Israel says that because there is no prior legal sovereign in the territory, most settlements there are permitted — save for wildcat settlements erected against Israel’s own laws – unless and until a negotiated peace deal decides otherwise. Palestinians claim everything Israel has built across the 1949 armistice line (“1967 border”) — including several neighborhoods of Jerusalem — is illegal.Palestinian leaders reportedly spokewith Secretary of State John Kerry last week in an effort to discourage an American veto of any anti-Israel resolution that emerges in the next few weeks.Breitbart News’ sources indicate that the Obama administration may decline to use its veto against a Security Council  resolution against Israel.Allowing the settlements to be declared illegal would be an enormous boost to the BDS movement, which seeks to isolate Israel. Such a resolution could also encourage renewed efforts to prosecute Israeli military and political officials in the International Criminal Court.Separately, the UN General Assembly is set tovote this weekto fund an effort by the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to compile a blacklist of any company doing business that directly or indirectly supports settlements – which, given the settlements’ integration into the Israeli economy, would effectively mean blacklisting companies doing business with Israel. The blacklist project wasapproved in March, but the money to accomplish it had yet to be allocated.However, that money appears in large measure already to have been spent — i.e. the compilation of the blacklist is already well under way. The UNHRC budget proposal calls for:General temporary assistance at the P-3 level for eight months for one staff who will, in close consultation with the Working Group on Business and Human Rights, create a database of all business enterprises involved in the activities detailed in paragraph 96 of the report of the independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem; and draft a report presenting the above-requested tasks to the Council at its thirty-fourth session.The 34th session is from February to March 2017, meaning that the project has been ongoing for several months before facing an official appropriations vote.The Obama administration, which recently ran for re-election to the UNHRC and strongly supports the institution, has not indicated whether it will vote against the BDS provision.  If it passes, the UN will have succeeded in creating an international database to be used in anti-Israel boycotts and the United States taxpayer will be footing 22% of the bill – unless action is taken on the domestic front to prevent the expenditure.The UNHRC, like much of the rest of the UN, is disproportionately focused on Israel. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is being credited for acknowledging the anti-Israel bias of the UN as a whole: “Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports and conferences criticizing Israel,” he told the UN Security Councillast week(while, ironically, encouraging another such UN Security Council resolution).And yet that disproportionate focus continues — with the outgoing Obama administration rumored to be about to deliver a parting blow.Joel B.

4790747647,http://www.breitbart.com/news/recent-rise-in-yen-extremely-worrying-japan-finance-minister/,Recent rise in yen ‘extremely worrying’: Japan finance minister,"Tokyo (AFP) – Japan’s finance minister said late Saturday the recent sharp rise in the yen is “extremely worrying”, adding Tokyo will take action when necessary.The remarks, which suggest Tokyo’s possible market intervention, came after the Japanese unit surged to an 18-month high against the dollar in New York Friday.It extended the previous day’s rally, which was boosted by a surprising monetary decision made by the Bank of Japan.On Thursday, the central bank shocked markets by failing to provide more stimulus, confounding expectations it would act after a double earthquake and a string of weak readings on the world’s number three economy.The dollar tumbled to 106.31 yen in New York Friday, its lowest level since October 2014, from 108.11 yen.The greenback had bought 111.78 yen in Tokyo before the BoJ announcement on Thursday.“The yen strengthened by five yen in two days. Obviously one-sided and biased, so-called speculative moves are seen behind it,” Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters at Haneda airport.“It is extremely worrying,” he said.The finance minister left on a trip, which will also take him to an annual Asian Development Bank meeting in Germany.“Tokyo will continue watching the market trends carefully and take actions when necessary,” he added.A strong currency is damaging for Japan’s exporting giants, such as Toyota and Sony, as it makes their goods more expensive overseas and shrinks the value of repatriated profits.Aso has reiterated that Japan could intervene in forex markets to stem the unit’s steep rise, saying moves to halt the currency’s “one-sided, speculative” rally would not breach a G20 agreement to avoid competitive currency devaluations.Japan last intervened in currency markets around November 2011, when it tried to stem the yen’s rise against the greenback to keep an economic recovery on track after the quake-tsunami disaster earlier that year."
7070014325,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/07/25/study-biomass-worse-for-environment-than-fossil-fuels/,Study: Biomass Worse for Environment than Fossil Fuels,"Power stations that burn biomass are worse for the environment than those that burn coal, new analysis suggests.According to David MacKay, the government’s chief scientific advisor on energy, burning wood imported from North America in British power stations produces more greenhouse gases than burning coal.As previouslyreportedonBreitbart London, American scientists wrote a letter to the British government in May to protest the policy of subsidising power firms to import wooden pellets from the U.S. They said that this was anything but carbon neutral as the forests from which the pellets are taken act as a “carbon sink”, taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.Using pellets from these forests therefore not only depletes the size of the “sink”, it releases the absorbed carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.Shipping the pellets 3,800 miles across the Atlantic adds even more to the carbon footprint.David MacKay has now found that this process can produce even more carbon dioxide than burning fossil fuels.A previousarticlein theDaily Mailexposed the Drax power station in Yorkshire as one of the worst offenders. The station buys more than a million metric tonnes of pellets from the US each year, and produces more than three percent more carbon dioxide than coal, and more than twice as much as natural gas. Adding in the carbon footprint of transporting the pellets over from America, that amounts to more than 20 percent more carbon emissions than standard coal.Also, as the energy produced by Drax is subsidised to the tune of £105 per Megawatt Hour (MW/hr), and the wholesale energy price is just £50 per MW/hr, this means that the project can only survive through government subsidies.The UK is currently committed by law to increase the proportion of energy generated by “renewable” energy sources to 30 percent by 2020, with more than a third of this supplied by biomass fuel."

The Berkeley prof fired back, saying: “Public advisory: don’t call the cops on black people for no reason. Black people disagreeing with you on Twitter is not a crime.”Berkeley professor Jelani Nelson says that Stanford Graduate School of Education professor Jo Boaler threatened to call the police on him after he criticized her $5,000 per hour consulting fee charged to public school districts and questioned if she was really working to help minority students.Berkeley Prof Jelani Nelson“A @Stanford professor just threatened me with police,” Nelson tweeted. “After BBQ Becky, Permit Patty, Golfcart Gail, and all the memes, we now have Retweet Rachel.”“Public advisory: don’t call the cops on black people for no reason,” the professor added. “Black people disagreeing with you on Twitter is not a crime.”In his tweet, Nelson also included purported screenshots of emails he had received from Boaler, in which she suggests she had contacted the police over his online criticism of her.“As a courtesy to a fellow faculty member I wanted to let you know that the sharing of private details about me on social media yesterday is now being taken up by police and lawyers,” Boaler wrote in her email to Nelson.“I was shocked to see that you are taking part in spreading misinformation and harassing me online,” she added.In her purported email, Boaler also shared a screenshot of a tweet by Nelson that she found problematic, in which he wrote the following:The proposed CA Math Framework states improving math learning for black students as central motivation and has 0 black authors. Instead, one author has alarmingly lucrative consulting deals with school districts with large minority populations, charging $5,000/hr.“Please take down this social media post and consider acting in more collegial and productive ways to help students get a better future in mathematics in California,” Boaler added in her email to Nelson.Twitter has since removed other posts by Nelson that Boaler claimed share “private details” about her, reports theStanford Review, which also notes that the removed content consists of public records taken directly from the Oxnard School District’s website.Those records expose that Boaler charged tens of thousands of dollars to public schools in California, the report adds.“It is horrifying that the CMF claiming to uplift black children was co-authored by a person who finds police intimidation against blacks acceptable,” Nelson tweeted, firing back at Boaler.“I encourage concerned alumni and members of the Stanford community to express your concern to the university administration,” he added.According to the Stanford Review, the original contract Boaler signed with the Oxnard School District in November 2020 agreed to provide eight hours of consultation across four sessions at a rate of $5,000 per session ($20,000 total).But “$5,000 per session wasn’t nearly enough for Boaler,” the report added, stating that the professor “had meant to charge $5,000 per hour, i.e. $10,000 per session, for a total bill of $40,000,” ad that the Oxnard School District agreed to that change in August 2021.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo onFacebookand Twitter at@ARmastrangelo, and onInstagram."

(AP) — A grizzly bear attacked and killed a 38-year-old mountain biker Wednesday as he was riding along a trail just outside Glacier National Park, Montana authorities said.Brad Treat and another rider were in the Halfmoon Lakes area of the Flathead National Forest when they apparently surprised the bear, Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Curry said.The bear knocked Treat off his bike, and the second rider left to look for help, Curry said.Authorities found Treat’s body at the scene, but not the bear. Wildlife and law-enforcement officials were searching for the grizzly Wednesday evening.Treat was a law-enforcement officer with the U.S. Forest Service.“Brad was an integral member of our area law enforcement team and a friend to us all,” Curry said.Treat grew up in nearby Kalispell, where was a standout distance runner in high school, his former coach, Paul Jorgenson, told the Flathead Beacon newspaper.“He was a really good runner but he was also a kind-hearted person who cared about people,” Jorgenson told the Beacon.The second rider, who was not identified, was not injured. Authorities have closed the area, which is about 3 miles away from Glacier’s west entrance, for public safety.Grizzlies in the Lower 48 states have been designated a threatened species since the 1970s, but their numbers are increasing and so are conflicts between humans and bears.The grizzlies in the Glacier area among about 1,000 bears in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, which also includes the Bob Marshall Wilderness south of the park. At least 700 more grizzlies live in and around Yellowstone National Park, which is roughly 360 miles south of Glacier.Six people have been fatally mauled by bears in the Northern Rockies since 2010, but those deaths were mainly in the Yellowstone area. Glacier officials say there are usually one or two non-lethal encounters between bears and humans each year inside the park.Before Wednesday, there had been 10 bear-related human deaths in Glacier since the park was created in 1910.  The last was in 1998, when three bears killed and partially ate a park vendor employee while he was hiking.In the most well-known Glacier attacks, bears killed two people in different parts of the park in a single night in 1967. Those attacks became the subject of a 1969 book by Jack Olsen titled “Night of the Grizzlies,” and later a documentary by the same name."

However, as one sports journalist alleges, ESPN can be just as bad when it comes to the treatment of women.Most will remember Jenn Sterger as the former Jets reporter who allegedlyreceivedraunchy photos and racy voicemail messages from Brett Favre. Now, you might know her as something else: The woman who alleges her ESPN interview ended up in a strip club.Stergertweetedabout the incident on Monday, after news broke that ESPN had ended their relationship with Barstool after one episode:https://twitter.com/jennifersterger/status/922654664977297408According to Sterger, in 2007 she went to Charlotte, North Carolina, to audition for an on-air opportunity. After the meeting, Sterger says she was invited to a club. However, Sterger, who was only 23 years old at the time, says the “club” turned out to be a strip club.“I was extremely uncomfortable by the situation and incredibly awkward as I had never stepped foot in one before,” Sterger said. “I had to watch as my male coworkers got lap-dances from girls while they teased me about how I was uncomfortable and didn’t want to participate.”The next day, Sterger says that two ESPN bosses confronted her and asked her if she had gone to the strip club.Sterger said, “I told them I had been, but didn’t want to be there once I realized what it was. They admonished me and said it was a bad look for the company for me to be there and to never do it again. I was fired before my plane landed in Tampa.”As theNew York Postreports, “It is unclear if Sterger worked at ESPN.”ESPNreleaseda statement regarding Sterger’s allegations, “We have no record of this ever being brought to our attention. We thoroughly investigate all allegations brought to us. Fostering a professional and respectful workplace is a top priority for ESPN and we always encourage people to report any issues.”Though, considering ESPN hired Barstool, the claim that they hold “fostering a professional and respectful workplace” as a top priority, is certainly on shaky ground.Sterger wasn’t done, though. She went on to claim that in 2008, a year after the alleged Charlotte incident, she was invited to interview for another ESPN job, this time in Bristol, Connecticut.Sterger recalls, “They sent a car service to Jersey to pick me up. When I asked for more details about the job, everyone I spoke to were super vague and nondescript about what they were looking for. They had me come in, and paraded me around the place. Then took me into the office for some weird line of questioning. Asking me if I had hooked up with ‘so and so’ etc. or ‘this person’ or ‘that person’ … this was my job interview.”Sterger was then informed that her car ride to go home had been canceled. At that point, she was encouraged to catch a ride with an employee, who told her of the “numerous girls” he was hooking up with. The employee also said that he was “helping their careers.”Sterger told the employee she was in a relationship, though, this did not deter him.“We made it to the city where he asked me to go to dinner with him, I declined & got on the closest train. I cried the whole way home. He still works there. He’s still gainfully employed. He’s a decision maker there,” Sterger recalled. “I later found out through a friend that works there they only brought me in to show his coworkers I was ‘just as f–kable in person as I was in pictures.’ That and he insinuated he and I had hooked up …. Which NEVER happened.”Sterger stressed that she did not mean to accuse Barstool of harassment. Instead, she only meant to point out ESPN’s hypocrisy:Sterger’s allegations come on the heels of ESPN Host Sam Ponder’scriticismsof Barstool, and multiple sexual harassment and rapeallegationssurrounding Hollywood Producer Harvey Weinstein."

Close it down.'”Phillips said his potential layoff was a “relief” and his “plan is to find another job.”“We have unemployment, but nobody wants unemployment without the health benefits. So, we’re pretty much going to find another job,” Phillips said.Tressy Daniel, who worked at the plant for 26 years, said she thought her losing her job was going to be a “victory for her.”“I know I’m out of a job, but I still feel myself as coming out with a victory,” she said. “When one door closes, another will open for you.”About 18,500 Hostess employees will lose jobs because union workers did not end their strike by Friday, and Americans will potentially be deprived of one of the most iconic and traditional snacks because of greedy unions. Some Hostess union workers who desperately needed their jobs eventually crossed the picket lines, but it was not enough.Even the Teamsters Union, one of the toughest negotiators, had come to an agreement with Hostess, but the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union refused to come to terms with Hostess before Friday’s deadline."

Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said Sunday that Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s election as governor was based on his emphasis on job creation. McAuliffe defeated Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Tea Party-supported Republican.""When the voters are presented with a candidate who focuses on creating jobs and investing in education and working together, versus a candidate who doubled down on the politics of shutdown, who embraced Tea Party extremism, who was a leader in the war on women, particularly on women’s health, they overwhelmingly chose Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate, and elected him,"" Wasserman-Schultz said on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""Wasserman-Schultz said she did not see the Virginia election as a referendum on President Obama’s healthcare initiative. She said McAuliffe won by about the same percentage of votes as Obama received in the last presidential election and did not expect the Obamacare controversy to be as heated an issue in the 2014 congressional elections as it was this year.But Rence Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, argued Obamacare would flounder in the coming months and drag the Democrats down with it. ""This issue is going to be toxic for the Democrats and, believe me, we will tattoo it to their foreheads in 2014. We will run on it and they will lose because of it,"" he said."

At one point in the permitting process, D.C. officials requested information from TPP in a serious of events the group’s leaders said would make “your blood boil” if “you despise government bureaucracy and big government in general.”In an e-mail blast to local and national Tea Party groups on Tuesday, Tea Party Patriotsnoted that the rally, starting at noon on the 19th, was important because the IRS scandal is one that crosses party lines and impacts Republicans, independents, and Democrats.“With all of mess and scandals that are going on in DC, we need to have a big presence to tell them that we aren’t going to take it,” Martin wrote. “We are focusing on the IRS because it is the issue that can cross both lines. No one likes the government abusing its power, and that’s the message we want to convey.”The group emphasized that the “focus of therally will be the IRS to try to reach the broadest audience that we can and gain as much support as we can” and asked local Tea Party leaders to “start spreading the word to your groups.”The IRS has come under fire for deliberately targeting groups applying for tax-exempt status that had “Tea Party” or “Patriots” in their names. The agency naturally scrutinized Tea Party Patriots, a group that had raised concerns about IRSharassmentbefore revelations came to light.J. Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, said the abuse of power that he discovered while auditing the IRS was “unprecedented.”“Together we stand with all of the groups and individuals who were affected and give our fellow Americans the opportunity to see more of the people who have been unfairly abused by the IRS,” Martin told Breitbart News. “We have been fighting for constitutionally limited government for over 4 years. The discriminatory tactics from the IRS and an abusive government will not intimidate us or stop us from fighting for the country we love.”Photo: CantWinThisGame/Wikimedia Commons"
7202219055,https://www.breitbart.com/news/a-way-of-life-japans-whalers-back-treaty-withdrawal-2/,‘A way of life’: Japan’s whalers back treaty withdrawal,"Minamiboso (Japan) (AFP) – Neatly lining up sliced whale meat to make “jerky” in the wintry sea breeze, Tetsuya Masaki says whaling is just part of daily life in his tiny Japanese community of Minamiboso.Japan sparked outrage in December when it decided to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission, saying it would return to commercial whaling as part of its cultural heritage.Rarely is that heritage more in evidence that in Minamiboso, a town on the Pacific coast some 70 kilometres (40 miles) south of Tokyo that is home to Gaibo Hogei, one of a handful of remaining local whaling companies.Masaki, 32, a processing factory worker for Gaibo Hogei, admits that the local whaling industry has shrunk but says it is still an “indispensable” part of the town — especially during the summer whaling season.The firm allows local residents and tourists to watch whales being dismembered at its slaughterhouse as part of efforts to keep alive the region’s 400-year-old whaling history.Local schoolchildren also come to the seaside facility where they can get a closer look at the rare sight of workers stripping the flesh from the thick skin of whales with special choppers.Gaibo Hogei’s president, 57-year-old Yoshinori Shoji, said Japan’s decision to withdraw from the IWC was “far too late but the right answer”, adding that he backed it “100 percent”.Shoji’s firm annually harpoons 26 giant beaked whales — a type not covered by the IWC but subject to domestic Japanese quotas — and lands them at Wada port, one of the country’s five bases for coastal whaling.He said he was gearing up “as a matter of course” to resume commercial whaling of minke whales — protected under the treaty — once Tokyo formally leaves the IWC in June.– ‘Regional speciality’ –Tokyo’s decision sparked a firestorm of criticism from environmentalists and anti-whaling countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada.It was a rare piece of provocative diplomacy by Japan, which has generally pursued an uncontroversial foreign policy since its World War II defeat.But a poll in January by public broadcaster NHK suggested that a majority (53 percent) of people backed the withdrawal decision, compared with 37 percent opposed.Japan vowed to forge ahead with commercial whaling of minke and other whales off its coast but said it was stopping its most provocative whaling — annual Antarctic expeditions that used an IWC loophole permitting hunting for scientific research.The country makes little secret of the fact that much of the meat from the “research” ends up on the dinner plate, and local Minamiboso resident Kazuo Tachikawa is proud that whale meat is a “regional speciality”.“You can buy whale meat at all supermarkets and seafood shops here,” the 70-year-old said at a roadside station, where a huge model of a blue whale skeleton stands alongside harpoon guns.But other locals appeared unmoved by the controversy.“I would be concerned if it were tuna or other fish,” said Sadae Nakamura, a 67-year-old housewife.“I even don’t know the difference between research whaling and commercial whaling,” she laughed. “It’s all politics that is beyond people like me.”In terms of politics, many members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party are supporters of whaling, and he himself comes from a constituency where whale hunting remains popular.– ‘Nostalgia’ for whale meat –Japan has hunted whales for centuries and the meat was a key source of protein in the immediate post-World War II years when the country was desperately poor.But consumption has declined significantly in recent decades, with much of the population saying they rarely or never eat whale meat.“Those who have interest in eating whale meat are extremely limited” in Japan, said Hisayo Takada, programme director at Greenpeace Japan, adding that Tokyo appears to be hitting back emotionally at foreign pressure over the practice.“It’s hard to believe the decision will lead to a rapid expansion of Japan’s whaling industry,” which is much smaller than fishing, added Takada.At a Tokyo restaurant serving up whale sushi and cutlets, 70-year-old pensioner Kunio Adachi admits that he only dines on whale out of “nostalgia”.“I support the status quo,” he added."
5310221901,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/16/five-great-concealed-carry-revolves-christmas-wish-list/attachment/smith-wesson-637/,Five Great Concealed Carry Revolvers for Your Christmas Wish List,"On the heels of our list ofsix great concealed carry pistolspeople might consider for their Christmas wish list, Breitbart News thought the time is right to point out five revolvers that are great for concealed carry as well.Full disclosure — I am a sucker for revolvers. I love the fact that they are ultra-dependable, and I like the nostalgic aspect of carrying a wheel gun for self-defense. Moreover, although many 21st century revolvers offer multiple caliber options, I like the tried and true .38 Special round and the forever formidable .357 Magnum.For anyone not familiar with revolvers, it is important to note that the ones chambered in .357 Magnum will also shoot .38 Special — so by buying a .357 revolver, you actually get two guns (or a gun that shoots two rounds). The .38 Special has far less recoil and is a particularly popular with female concealed carriers or anyone who wants to carry a gun that combines stopping power with reduced recoil.Taurus Model 85 (.38 Special)— TheTaurusModel 85 is a no-frills snub nose revolver chambered in .38 Special +P. This means it will shoot regular .38 Special or higher pressure/velocity self-defense loads with hollow point bullets.And it will do it well. The 85 is a classic revolver which means it is double action/single action — i.e., you can pull the hammer back and release it with a long pull on the trigger or you can cock the hammer with your thumb then fire a round via a very short pull on the trigger.The revolver is light — weighing in at 22.2 ounces — and it holds five rounds of ammunition. It is super easy to use, extremely concealable, and comfortable to carry on one’s person, in a purse, or in a backpack. The 85 also comes with a built-in internal lock that can be activated with a key. Once activated, the gun is inoperable — it cannot fire. This is an option some people like when the gun is going to be stored for long periods of time or when small children are nearby.Approximate price for a Model 85 — $375.TaurusSmith & Wesson Model 637 (.38 Special)— TheSmith & WessonModel 637 is chambered in .38 Special +P, just like the Taurus Model 85. The 637 also operates on the same double action/single action platform as the Model 85, and it holds five rounds of ammunition like the Taurus. The real differences between the two guns come down to weight and differences in trigger feel. The Model 637 weights 14.03 ounces — roughly 8 ounces lighter than the Model 85 — and its trigger feels different. The feel is mush smoother — therefore better — in the minds of some, but not different enough to bicker about in the minds of others. It’s super lightweight — “airweight” according to Smith & Wesson — which makes it a gun that lends itself to concealment and everyday carry; whether on one’s person, in a purse, or in a backpack.Approximate price for a Model 637 — $480.Smith & WessonCharter Arms Undercover Lite Standard (.38 Special)— TheCharter ArmsUndercover Light Standard is a five-shot revolver that is considerably different from the Taurus Model 85 or the Smith & Wesson Model 637. Those differences lie in the mechanism Charter arms uses to lock the firearm’s cylinder into place and in the length of the grip. The cylinder lockup differences do not impact the way you use the gun in the slightest, they are simply apparent when you first look at the gun. On the other hand, the length of the grip does provide some key differences in that it allows you to get one more finger on the grip, thereby making recoil easier to control. The longer grip also means someone who tries to wrestle the gun out of your hand better pack a lunch; it’s not going to be easy. The drawback of the longer grip is that it makes the Lite Standard’s handle slightly longer than the handle on Taurus Model 85 or the Smith & Wesson Model 637, which means the handle can cause a bulge under certain shirts during concealed carry. This is not a problem once you ascertain which shirts to carry it under. On the other hand, the Lite Standard weighs in at 12 ounces–approximately 10 ounces lighter than the Taurus and 2 ounces lighter than the Smith & Wesson–which mean the comfort of carrying is nearly unmatched.The drawback of the longer grip is that it makes the Lite Standard’s handle slightly longer than the handle on Taurus Model 85 or the Smith & Wesson Model 637, which means the handle can cause a bulge under certain shirts during concealed carry. This is not a problem once you ascertain which shirts to carry it under. On the other hand, the Lite Standard weighs in at 12 ounces — approximately 10 ounces lighter than the Taurus and 2 ounces lighter than the Smith & Wesson — which means the comfort of carrying is nearly unmatched.Approximate price for a Lite Standard — $370.Charter ArmsRuger LCR (.357 Magnum)— TheRugerLCR is a double action revolver with a concealed hammer, hidden within the frame of the gun and covered by “fire control housing” to prevent snagging when pulling the gun from your pocket or from beneath a shirt under duress. The frame of the LCR is made of polymer to reduce weight, while the components under stress are made from steel. The LCR weighs in at 17.1 ounces. It holds five rounds of .357 Magnum ammunition or five rounds of .38 Special and/or .38 Special +P. The LCR is a great gun for those looking for a self-defense weapon that is comfortable and easy to carry at all times. It is ultra-reliable (after all, it’s a Ruger), and it is durable. The hidden hammer makes this gun especially apropos for being carried in a purse or backpack, as concerns over getting hair ties, bracelets, etc., tangled around the hammer are gone.Approximate price for a Ruger LCR — $520 to $550.RugerRuger SP101 (.357 Magnum)— TheRugerSP101 is a workhorse. It is heavier than other revolvers in this list — weighs in at 26 ounces — and the barrel is longer, making the gun roughly an inch longer than a snubby like the Smith & Wesson Model 637. However, that being said, the extra weight and size of the SP101 translate into less-felt recoil which, in turn, translates to better control. And if you use .38 Special and/or .38 Special +P instead of .357 Magnum, the recoil is reduced even further. The SP101 is not a purse gun like some of the other firearms on this list. It is better suited for an inside the waistband holster or an outside the waistband holster.It is spot-on for an open carry revolver.Approximate price for a Ruger SP101 — $560 to $580.RugerThere are myriad accessories available for all five of these revolvers. From holsters byFobus,Alien Gear, andClingerto aftermarket grips with built-in lasers byCrimson Trace. In fact, many of the revolvers in this list are available in models that come equipped with Crimson Trace laser grips.As with all firearm purchases, be sure you know the laws of your state and, upon acquiring a gun, take the time to familiarize yourself with it. Familiarization contributes to safety and confidence, and both will be needed if you have to pull the gun and use it in the blink of an eye to defend your life and/or liberty.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

It would be better that they stayed here until other solutions are found,” she added.The judge in the case is due to visit the Jungle Tuesday morning to meet residents and assess the situation before giving a verdict later in the day.Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has said the eviction will be done “progressively, by persuasion and with respect for people’s dignity”.But Christian Salome, who heads a migrant aid group, said making them move in the middle of winter showed a total disregard for refugee rights.“This is a terrible step backwards,” he said.The state wants to eventually reduce the population of the Jungle to 2,000 people.Those being pushed out of the camp can go to one of around 100 accommodation centres elsewhere in France, or into refitted shipping containers set up nearby.The containers have not proved popular with migrants, who say they lack communal spaces and restrict their movements, while local charities say they fail to meet international standards.Conditions in other camps along the northern French coast are even more dire than those in the Jungle.The French authorities have been gradually trying to shut down the Jungle, encouraging residents to head for proper centres elsewhere in France.However, many of the residents have family or community ties to Britain and are reluctant to give up their dream of crossing the Channel.A campaign spearheaded by celebrities such as actors Jude Law and Benedict Cumberbatch has called on the British government to let children from the camp be reunited with families in Britain and take responsibility for the “humanitarian crisis” in the Jungle.Calais town hall has claimed the eviction is in response to “abuses” committed by migrants that had led to “an aggravated level of tension” in recent weeks.It said camp residents were throwing stones and other projectiles at lorries and security forces on a daily basis, but also condemned members of far-right groups who loiter outside the Jungle to beat up migrants.On Monday, six migrants were each given a month in prison for occupying a ferry in northern France in a protest calling for Britain to allow asylum seekers in."

Many of Xi Jinping’s advisers have argued that the U.S. government is so deeply divided that the better strategy is for China to hold out hope for a better deal from a weakened Trump presidency or a new Democratic regime. The push for impeachment is widely viewed within China’s state economic apparatus as evidence that U.S. government is virtually paralyzed by division.Some inside of China also believe that impeachment could push Donald Trump to agree to a trade deal quickly in order score a public “win.”The USMCA agreement, however, puts a historic public trade victory onto the scoreboard for Trump. It is the first trade deal in generations supported by the left and right, labor unions, and free-traders. It suggests that on trade, America is far less divided than it is on many other issues.Pelosi and Democrat negotiators worked closely with labor leaders and the Trump administration team, led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, to strengthen the agreement from the U.S. perspective. That level of cooperation on trade also suggests that the Chinese hawk view badly underestimated the ability of the U.S. political system to operate effectively despite deep partisan divisions.Some in Chinese policy circles who thought Trump might seek a quick trade deal have also worried that Democrats would seek to pressure the White House out of reaching an agreement.“From the perspective of electoral politics, Democrats have reasons to hinder the Trump administration from reaching any agreement with China that can be touted as a ‘victory,'” aGlobal Timesop-ed recently claimed. “They want the US public to focus on the impeachment, and would pour scorn on any compromise the Trump government could make in trade negotiations with China.”The USMCA deal highlights a possibility that is even worse from the Chinese nationalist perspective: a U.S. government that stands together in demanding tough trade deals."

The US strike sent a strong message that this will no longer stand. The actions by our American allies serve as a beacon of morality for the entire international community.”Hinting at Israel’s pleasure at the direction the Trump administration indicated by the decision to bomb the airbase, Likud’s Transportation Minister and close Netanyahu ally Yisrael Katz said on Friday that the “policy of leading from behind has failed” – a direct reference to the approach to the Syrian civil war of former President Barack Obama.Leader of Israel’s largest opposition party Isaac Herzogsaidthe American airstrike sent an “important message to the Damascus butcher.”The decision to launch Tomahawks against the Homs airbase happened “at the right time, at the right timing and at the right place.”Yair Lapid, leader of Israel’s second-largest Yesh Atid party, wrote in a tweet: “Better late than never. The US strikes are the right move, I welcome the decision to attack those who murder children in Syria.”“If the civilized world stands by while children are gassed to death it’s not civilized,” he wrote in asecond tweet. “There are times when use of force is the moral act.”Even the leader of Israel’s leftmost Jewish party, Meret leader Zehava Gal-On,wrote in a tweetthat the world “must not stand idly by when crimes against humanity occur. The strike against Assad is an important step, but its significance will be measured by the extent of America’s commitment to protect civilians going forward.”Only one party in Israeli politics was against the US strike: the Joint List.The party is an amalgamation of three smaller Arab parties, with platform ranging from an emphases on communist values to an emphasis on Islamic values.Hadash, the communist party with the Joint List, last week succeeded in preventing the List from issuing a statement condemning the Syrian attack in Idlib which prompted the American airstrike.According to a report in Hebrew paperHaaretzon Sunday, the party ended up ignoring the news altogether, with some of the MKs in the party publishing statements condemning the Syrian attack separately. Others avoided presenting a resolute point of view on the attack.Over the weekend, in a Hadash committee in northern Israel, the party’s chairman Muhammad Barakeh condemned the US retaliatory attack.“We cannot remain neutral faced with children and baby victims, I am for the right to life and their right to live,” Barakeh said, but then added: “The solution in Syria must be diplomatic, to remove the terrorism of IS and those who support [the group] and to maintain the unity of Syria as a state and as a people.”MK Ahmed Tibi, the chairman of Ta’al, another of the parties comprising the Joint List, condemned both the Assad regime and the US for their respective attacks."

4896698678,http://www.breitbart.com/news/oil-might-not-drive-some-economies-long-term-imf-said/,"Oil might not drive some economies long-term, IMF said","WASHINGTON, June 9 (UPI) — Particularly in the Middle East and Central Asia, lessons from the slump in crude oil prices suggest a revenue overhaul may be needed, the IMF said.A survey this week from the World Bank found the global economy may be slowing down. For countries that rely on imports, the weak market for crude oil may be providing stimulus, with commodity-importing economies on pace to expand by 5.8 percent in 2016. For the Middle East and North Africa, the World Bank said growth is expected at 2.9 percent, a 1.1 percent reduction from a January forecast.“The downward revision comes as oil prices are expected to track lower for the year, at an average of $41 per barrel,” the bank said.A review from Martin Sommer, Juan Treviño, and Neil Hickey with the International Monetary Fund found the drop in crude oil prices since mid-2014 is dragging on the growth momentum for economies that rely heavily on fossil fuels for revenue.“This applies particularly to countries of the Middle East and Central Asia, because these regions are home to 11 of the world’s top 20 energy exporters,” they said.For exports, the IMF economists said budgets have moved from surplus to deficit and overall growth has slowed. Continuing on with a business-as-usual economic agenda may no longer work for most of the oil-based economies, they said.In April, the IMF said the Iranian economy is expected to grow about 4 percent this year because of higher oil production and the lifting of sanctions, which should help lift the prospects for the region as a whole. The decline in crude oil prices for Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, could translate to a 1.2 percent increase in real gross domestic product, compared with 3.5 percent growth last year.An economic agenda, dubbed Vision 2030, aims to boost Saudi Arabia’s non-oil revenue, something the IMF said should help drive forward momentum. The IMF said the strategy should help diversify the Saudi economy and increase the role of a private sector governed traditionally by the monarchy.The IMF economists said fiscal restraints on subsidies for oil and gas are just part of an overall effort to push regional economies beyond fossil fuels. The long-term process, they said, will be “difficult,” though many regional policymakers are off to a good start.“In the coming years, oil revenues will no longer be sufficient for governments to act as the main employer of their fast-growing young populations,” they said. “Therefore, policymakers must find new ways to promote private sector development and help their economies diversify away from oil.”"
5205266386,http://www.breitbart.com/news/ghana-professors-demand-gandhi-statue-be-removed-over-his-racist-identity/,Ghana professors demand Gandhi statue be removed over his ‘racist identity’,"ACCRA, Ghana, Oct. 7 (UPI) — Government officials in Ghana say they will move a statue of Mahatma Gandhi from a university campus after professors there launched a petition.Professors at the University of Ghana successfully petitioned for the statue’s removal, claiming it should be replaced with one of a local hero because of seemingly racist early writings by Gandhi about black South Africans.The statue was unveiled by Indian president Pranab Mukherjee in June as a symbol of the relationship between India and Ghana. In September, professors at the university launched the petition to have it removed, garnering more than 1,000 signatures and drawing the government’s response.“It is better to stand up for our dignity than to kowtow to the wishes of a burgeoning Eurasian super power,” the professors wrote in the petition, which also quoted writings by Gandhi including him referring to black South Africans with racial slurs and saying Indians were “infinitely superior.”Although Gandhi is internationally recognized for his role in India’s battle for independence from Britain and his nonviolent protests for civil rights in Africa, as well as India, he is somewhat controversial in both places.“Ours is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and then pass his life in indolence and nakedness,” Gandhi wrote, using a racist comparison of Indians and black South Africans in one early passage included with the petition.Government officials said they would relocate the statue from its current location to “ensure its safety and to avoid the controversy,” but added that the good that Gandhi contributed to the world should be considered along with his “flaws.”“While acknowledging that human as he was, Mahatma Gandhi may have had his flaws, we must remember that people evolve,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the official statement. “He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.”Obadele Kambon, one of the organizers of the petition, said moving the statue was not enough, however, and that it should be sent back to India based on Gandhi’s own estimation of the people walking past it every day.“We don’t think the statue would be well received anywhere in Ghana,” Kambon said."
7010941078,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2017/12/07/shame-mingles-self-congratulation-oscar-season/,Shame Mingles with Self-Congratulation in Oscar Season,"NEW YORK (AP) — In nearly every major Academy Awards category this year there’s some trace of the sexual misconduct allegations that have swept through the movie industry.Best supporting actor? That’s where Kevin Spacey was once considered a contender. Nowhe’s been scrubbedfrom Ridley Scott’s “All the Money in the World,” his performance replaced with one by Christopher Plummer.Best animated feature? The favorite is “Coco,” the latest from Pixar, the animation studio co-founded by John Lassater. He’s currentlyon a “sabbatical”following his admission of inappropriate behavior.Best director?With only four women ever nominated,no category better illustrates the industry’s ingrained gender equality issues — the same systematic imbalance that made it easier for Harvey Weinstein and others to act with such impunity for so long.And even best actress, a category where you might expect a moment’s reprieve, is —if tradition holds— to be presented by last year’s best-actor winner, Casey Affleck. He settled two sexual harassment allegations filed against him in 2010.Weinstein, whofor so long craved omnipresence on Oscar night, may finally get his wish. Even though the former Weinstein Co. co-chairman has been kicked out of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and his company’s namehas been erasedfrom its best Oscar shot this year (Taylor Sheridan’s “Wind River”), Weinstein will be ubiquitous in absentia.The ongoing sexual harassment scandals have colored every phase of awards season, but whether they will ultimately shape who wins is another question. The season is just getting into the swing of things, witha numberofcritics groupsannouncingtheir awardsin the past week and the Golden Globe nominations coming Monday. But in this year’s Oscar race, the Weinstein effect is already playing an unpredictable role.With so much disgrace to go around, is Hollywood still in the mood for self-congratulation?Atlast week’s Gotham Awards,the usually bubbly atmosphere was somewhat subdued, or at least Nicole Kidman thought so when she accepted a lifetime achievement award and urged the crowd to loosen up. Joana Vicente, executive director of the Independent Film Project, which puts on the Gothams, was one of the few to directly address the elephant in the room.“This has been a tough year for our industry and for the world,” said Vincente. “We would like to take a moment to recognize and to honor those women and those men who have stepped forward.”But at the same time, the movies have given plenty to celebrate. From “The Florida Project” to “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” this year’s awards favorites are a formidable bunch, rife with timely social commentary. Many of the most celebrated filmmakers, from Greta Gerwig to Jordan Peele, are young, giving an awards season once dominated by Weinstein what many now long for: new voices.The continuing fallout has made sexual harassment a commonly discussed topic on red carpets, at press junkets and on late-night shows — places that are typically reserved for more frothy banter. Sometimes, it has made for awkward interactions likea recent episode of NPR’s “Fresh Air,” in which Gerwig was questioned by host Terry Gross about Noah Baumbach, her boyfriend, casting Hoffman. The interview, for which Gerwig was widely praised, exemplified how the conversation around sexual harassment in Hollywood can overtake the spotlight reserved for the year’s best films.Even the most trusted staple of Oscar season — screening Q&As and panel discussions — are now potentially fraught territory. At an anniversary screening of the film “Wag the Dog” moderator John Oliver grilled Dustin Hoffman over an earlier allegation that the actor groped a 17-year-old on the set of 1985 TV film “Death of a Salesman.” Hoffman, who has denied the allegation, is a possible supporting-actor contender and Gotham Awards honoree for his performance in Baumbach’s “The Meyerowitz Stories.”One veteran publicist of the season, who spoke on the condition on anonymity so as not to influence any campaigns, acknowledged that some clients have been coached to be ready to discuss sexual harassment issues. But the publicist said that the impact of the scandals on the Oscar race has been overstated.The film most perfectly poised for the post-Weinstein moment is Martin McDonagh’s “Three Billboards,” in which Frances McDormand stars as an outraged mother out to revenge the rape and murder of her daughter. The director has even imagined a face-off between McDormand’s wrathful protagonist, Mildred Hayes, and Weinstein. “We all know who would win,” says McDonagh.Yet, in the early going, two lively and precise coming-of-age tales — Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me By Your Name” and Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” — have been cleaning up the most. Tom O’Neil, the veteran awards analyst ofGold Derby, said the early love for these “little movies with a big heart,” as he called them, has forced him to re-examine his initial prediction of glory for “Three Billboards.”“Three Billboards” wonthe highly predictive audience awardat the Toronto International Film Festival in September. And many have viewed McDormand as the overwhelming best-actress favorite. But early wins have gone to Saoirse Ronan of “Lady Bird,” Meryl Streep of “The Post” and Sally Hawkins of “The Shape of Water.”“It still may do very well. It’s going to do extremely well with the Golden Globe nominations about to come out,” said O’Neil. “But ‘Three Billboards’ may just be too negative for these Oscar voters looking for uplifting messages.”Other films can legitimately claim the mantel of “the movie of the moment.” ″Lady Bird,” Gerwig’s solo directorial debut, stands apart, aas one columnist wrote, for “so genuinely reflect(ing) a woman’s experience and viewpoint.” No film captured the zeitgeist like Jordan Peele’s “Get Out,” a movie that cleverly rendered the realistic horrors of being black in America. Steven Spielberg’s upcoming Pentagon Papers drama, “The Post,” is both a celebration of a free press meant as a rebuke to President Donald Trump, and a tale of female empowerment led by Streep’s Katharine Graham. Sean Baker’s “The Florida Project” is a sunny fable that burrows inside the lives of the hidden homeless.The bigger-budget wildcard, Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk,” has received few nominations so far, including a best picture Critics’ Choice Awards nomination on Wednesday. It could yet emerge as a heavyweight on the merits of its big-screen craft.But there’s no question that the normal rhythms of Oscar season have been upset. Amazon, which last Oscars steered “Manchester by the Sea” to a best-picture nomination, is this year pushing the Kumail Nanjiani comedy “The Big Sick,” even while Amazon Studios head Roy Priceresigned on the heels of sexual harassment allegations. Angelina Jolie, whose Khmer Rouge family drama “First They Killed My Father” is Cambodia’s Oscar submission, wasamong the many womenwho spoke out about her experience with Weinstein.Between now and the March 4 Academy Awards, to be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, there may be more developments, too. Given the pace of revelations thus far, there will be.As a platform for bringing attention to gender inequality in Hollywood, the Academy Awards is far from perfect. Despite overhauling its membership in recent years, the film academy remains 72 percent male and 87 percent white. The changes have still been enough to make some ponder if the traditional notion of an “Oscar-friendly” movie have shifted, as they seemingly did last year when “Moonlight” upset “La La Land.”Ronan Farrow, who pennedthe New Yorker’s Weinstein exposes, was among those who in February contemplated whether #OscarsSoMalewas the more fitting hashtagafter several years of #OscarsSoWhite online protests. As has been noted, Oscar, himself, is male, naked and clutching only his sword. This year may be cause for, at the least, a change of attire."

That’s why I call him ‘Rocket Man,’” Trump said. “We have the most powerful military we’ve ever had, and we’re by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don’t have to use it, but if we do, we’ll use it.”In response, North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said Thursday that Trump’s remarks showed “no courtesy when referring to the dignified supreme leadership of the DPRK.” The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.“This has prompted the waves of hatred of our people against the U.S. and the Americans and they are getting higher and higher,” she said in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency.“If any words and expressions stoking the atmosphere of confrontation are used once again on purpose at this crucial moment, it must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard,” she added, using an insult Kim first hurled at Trump in 2017.Trump frequently referred to Kim as “Rocket Man” in speeches and on Twitter during the early months of his administration when tensions between Pyongyang and Washington were running high, threatening North Korea with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” in August 2017 and saying he would “totally destroy” the country in his first speech to the United Nations the next month.In response, Kim called Trump a “frightened dog” and a “dotard,” a term for a senile elderly person.Relations improved in 2018, leading to the historic Singapore summit between Trump and Kim in June of that year, which resulted in an agreement which called on North Korea to denuclearize and for both sides to build a “lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.”However, the two sides have remained far apart on the details, with Pyongyang seeking sanctions relief in exchange for taking steps toward dismantling its nuclear arsenal and Washington holding out for complete denuclearization.A second summit in February of this year in Hanoi, Vietnam ended abruptly without an agreement and negotiations have been at a stalemate since.North Korea returned to testing missiles after the failed summit, including launches of a ballistic missile based on the highly maneuverable Russian Iskander as well as a new submarine-launched ballistic missile.Its most recent launch came at the end of November, with two missiles fired from what the North described as a test of a “super-large multiple-rocket launcher.”North Korea has imposed a deadline of the end of the year for the United States to come up with a new proposal in its negotiations, and Pyongyang has been sending signals that it is shifting toward a more provocative stance for 2020.On Wednesday, Kim toured revolutionary battle sites on Mount Paektu on horseback, accompanied by senior military officials, and spoke of the need “to get prepared for the harshness and protracted character of our revolution,” KCNA reported.On the same day, the North announced that it would hold a meeting of senior officials in late December “to discuss and decide on crucial issues in line with the needs of the development of the Korean revolution and the changed situation at home and abroad.”"

All at a time Culpepper told doctors he was unable to work due to perpetual “low back pain and stiffness” which kept him from lifting heavy objects and being able to do everyday tasks like get into a bath.“I was on pain medication, and I had a back procedure right before that,” Culpepper told ABC News in his first public comments since the lawsuit was filed.“Just because I chose to do things that are contra [sic] to my body, doesn’t mean I’m not in pain, and doesn’t mean I’m not impaired.”Fairmount Premier, the insurer responsible Culpepper’s compensation, says Culpepper presented himself as much worse physically than someone who was injured and capable of pushing them selves, even if too far.“When asked if there are things he cannot do, defendant Culpepper testified that ‘everything is difficult,’” the lawsuit asserts.“Culpepper’s conduct was fraudulent, deceptive and designed to inflate the value of his claim and to take advantage of and abuse the California workers’ compensation system.”Culpepper’s wife Monica first appeared on Survivor as a solo contestent, and asked him to appear after the producers told her she would not be invited to compete again without here notable husband.“I 100 percent wish I had never asked him to be on the show,” Monica Culpepper lamented.“For all that he’s going through right now and being this insurance company’s target, is not worth it.”Culpepper played in the NFL between 1992 and 2000, with stints on the Minnesota Vikings, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Chicago Bears. Although he is being sued in California, Culpepper keeps his residence in the Tampa area."

Because in fact, everything is at stake.Joe Biden cannot continue to control this country if you have free access to information. It’s that simple. Biden certainly is not improving your life. He is not even trying to improve your life. So the best he can do is lie to you and demand that you believe it.But to do that, he needs to make certain that nobody else can talk because if you were to hear the truth, you might not obey. How is Biden going to pull that off? It’s not easy.Well, one option would be to get men with guns to tell you to shut up. Most Americans probably haven’t thought of that because this isn’t Africa or Eastern Europe, this is America, and we don’t do things like that here and never have more precisely, we haven’t until now.But now, Joe Biden is President and everything is different.So today, to herald the coming of the new Soviet America, the administration announced its own Ministry of Truth. This will be called the Disinformation Governance Board. Laugh if you want but just to show you they’re not kidding around here, this board is not part of the State Department or any other agency focused on foreign threats from abroad. No.The disinformation governance board is part of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS is a law enforcement agency designed to police the United States and that, by the way, has a famously large stockpile of ammunition. So it’s not a joke at all.Here is DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: We have just established a mis- and disinformation governance board in the Department of Homeland Security to more effectively combat this threat not only to election security, but to our homeland security.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Oh, so one of America’s top law enforcement officers just announced this to the Congress that actually we are going to be policing what you say, and everyone in the room kind of nods, “Oh, yes, that’s totally normal.”But here’s what he didn’t say. So America has told us the disinformation is a threat to Homeland Security. He is the head of the Department of Homeland Security, so presumably he would know since assessing threats to Homeland Security is his job, but what he didn’t tell us is how he is defining disinformation.So, here you have this new and terrifying thing that the Biden administration is so concerned about that it has created a new agency to fight it. But Mayorkas never said or even hinted as to what it might be. So the man in charge of the disinformation governing board never defined disinformation. It’s almost unbelievable when you think about it.Would you declare war on a country you couldn’t name? Would you send someone to death for a crime you couldn’t describe? Of course, you would, not if you were a sane and decent person, because you can’t have justice without precise definitions. That’s why we have very large books of law that define what is allowed and what is not.But they’re not defining the core concept at the heart of what is effectively a new law enforcement agency. Maybe that’s because Mayorkas doesn’t want justice, and neither does the President he serves. They want power, and to get power, they plan to control what you think. Watch Mayorkas explain.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYORKAS: We have so many different efforts underway to equip local communities to identify individuals who very well could be descending into violence, by reason of ideologies of hate, false narratives, or other disinformation and misinformation propagated on social media and other platforms.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Oh, did you know that? So, one of our biggest law enforcement agencies has men with guns around the country doing so many things to stop disinformation and false narratives. Those aren’t even lies, they’re just deviations from the approved script.Mayorkas told us again that men with guns plan to quote, “identify individuals who could be descending into violence.” Could be descending — not people who have committed violence or even been accused of any crime at all. DHS is instead using law enforcement powers to identify and punish people who think the wrong things, that would be opponents of the Biden administration. Is this dystopian fiction? No, it’s happening right in front of us.That means that Joe Biden’s partisan political enemies are now officially enemies of the state. How is this happening in America? Good question. But it is happening.And Biden’s new thought cop in chief has been revealed. She is a 33-year- old, fairly self-confident young woman called Nina Jankowicz. Jankowicz comes from a place called the Wilson Center. That’s a nonprofit name for America’s other mentally incapacitated war monger bigot President.Ironically, because everything is irony, the Wilson Center is itself a major producer of yes, disinformation, but of the neocon variety, and for that reason is heavily funded by the Biden administration. Jankowicz is also, because everything is connected, a former adviser to the neo-liberal government of Ukraine, the government, we’re shipping tens of billions of tax dollars to as our own economy swirls down the drain.So you really can’t make any of this up. It’s too grotesque. Would you believe a novel with this plot? No, you wouldn’t. But it’s happening. And that’s the bad news.The good news is, everyone involved in Joe Biden’s new ministry of information is a buffoon. They may be evil, but they’re also ridiculous. Nina Jankowicz is the most ridiculous of all.So you read about her appointment in “The Washington Post” this morning, and you immediately thought of the NKVD, because why wouldn’t you. Yet even the NKVD, even at the height of Stalin’s purges, never did karaoke. They were too dignified for that. But Nina Jankowicz happily does. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NINA JANKOWICZ, AUTHOR, “HOW TO LOSE THE INFORMATION WAR”: Information laundering is really quite ferocious. It’s when a huckster takes some lies and makes them sound precocious by saying them in Congress or in mainstream outlets so disinformation’s origins are slightly less atrocious.It’s how you hide a little lie, little lie. It’s how you hide a little lie, little lie. It’s how you hide a little, hide a little lie. Rudy Giuliani shared bad Intel from Ukraine. Or when TikTok influencers said COVID can cause pain. They’re laundering disinfo and we really should take note, and not support their lies we our wallet, voice or throat.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: This is the point of the show, we’re going to say, we’re kidding. We’re making all this up. It’s not really happening in the country you were born in, but it is happening. That’s now a law enforcement official. It’s also the person you just saw, an individual who brags about getting a Master’s Degree from Georgetown University. In case you’re wondering if the entire academic credentialing machine that sustains America’s ruling class is, in fact, a joke? Spoiler alert. Yes, it is a joke.This is somebody with so few useful skills that she describes herself in the first words of her own bio as a quote, “internationally recognized expert on disinformation,” as if that’s a job of some sort. Imagine if one of your kids grew up to be an internationally recognized expert on disinformation. The shame you would feel, the pain of knowing that truly and unequivocally, you had failed as a parent.After all those years of advanced education, Nina Jankowicz became an internationally recognized expert on disinformation and not only that, she can’t even rhyme very well. What Nina Jankowicz can do, her one skill, the purpose for which she was hired, is level partisan attacks on the other side with maximum ferocity. That is her real job.Now, you may have noticed if you listened carefully to the ditty that she just sang that every example of disinformation in her karaoke performance came from people who opposed Joe Biden’s policies. Is that a coincidence? Probably not. In fact, we know it’s not because Nina Jankowicz is telling all the disinformation is on the other side of the political divide. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JANKOWICZ: Most of the disinformation that we’ve seen in this highly emotionally manipulative content is coming from the right. If you look at the top-10 most engaged with posts on Facebook or Twitter on a given day, they are usually posts that are coming from the right and that’s because the right does deal on this highly emotional rhetoric.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: You’d have to live in a self-awareness-free vacuum. You might even have to go to Georgetown University to utter a sentence like that. “The right deals in this highly emotional rhetoric,” says Nina Jankowicz. Now, it’s worth noting here, because we can’t resist that this very same Nina Jankowicz once wrote an entire book about how women can’t use the Internet because it’s just too upsetting for them. They’re too fragile to read words they disagree with. It makes them faint.Here’s a direct quote from Nina Jankowicz’s book, quote: “To be a woman online is an inherently dangerous act.” Keep in mind, if you’re a lady and you were to, I don’t know, order UberEats, you’re exposing yourself to danger.This is the same woman, Nina Jankowicz, telling you that it’s the right that uses emotional rhetoric. Now, to be fair, Nina Jankowicz probably didn’t expect a lot of people to read that in her book because no one read her book. It has a total of two reviews on Amazon, but we did read it. We’ll get in a moment to what we found because it tells you exactly what we can expect from our new Ministry of Truth under Nina Jankowicz, but first, it’s necessary to know a little more about this person.Now, she is not simply a hypocrite, she obviously is, whether she knows it or not. She would be too dim to understand hypocrisy. What she really is, of course, is a hippie for the Democratic Party, and she’s done that job flawlessly.Nina Jankowicz, the disinformation hunter, once called the Hunter Biden laptop story, which is entirely true, a quote, “Trump campaign product.” In October of 2020, she wrote, quote: “Voters deserve the context, not a fairy tale, about a laptop repair shop.”Now, did she give us the context or any countervailing facts? Did she deliver the truth about the story? No, of course not. She just read a bunch of lies somebody handed to her on a card because she is a useful idiot and now, she is a law enforcement official.Nina Jankowicz is repeating a lie that was, of course, widespread on the eve of the presidential election and when she repeated it, made it possible for Joe Biden to repeat it on the debate stage during a presidential debate. In case you’ve forgotten, here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), THEN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There are 50 former national Intelligence folks who said that what he is accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the — four, five former heads of the C.I.A., both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except them, his and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You’ve got to be —BIDEN: That’s exactly what — that’s exactly what we’re told.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: Just to be clear, this is a nightmare unfolding in slow motion, but this is the point where we’re just going to have to draw the line. No, Joe Biden, you can’t have a federally funded Ministry of Truth and no, Nina Jankowicz can’t run it. Period.It’s not your country. You’re not even compos mentis and you don’t get to do this to a free people. Period. This can’t happen, and what is this? Well, if you want to know what’s going to happen, look at what just did happen.So Nina Jankowicz made it possible for a presidential candidate to lie from the debate stage about a story that may have changed the outcome of election, our election. Our presidential election, speaking of disinformation. She’s never apologized for that. That’s because her role has nothing to do with the truth or stopping disinformation. Her job is to restrict any speech that challenges Joe Biden or the Democratic Party.Now, you’d think that would be illegal in this country as a Federal employee, because we do have a First Amendment, but Nina Jankowicz doesn’t believe in the First Amendment.As she wrote recently quote, “The free speech versus censorship framing is a false dichotomy.” First of all, here’s a pro-tip. Anyone who uses the term “false dichotomy” is a moron, okay, that is one of countless academic phrases designed to prevent thought rather than facilitate it.False dichotomy means they’re never going to have to explain why their position is correct or yours is wrong. That is dismissed with, “Oh, it’s a false dichotomy.”Again, that’s an NPR phrase used by low-IQ people who for some reason want our country, all of a sudden. False dichotomy.Here is what’s not false at all: Government censorship is banned by the First Amendment, the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights. This whole country is predicated on that, but according to Joe Biden’s new minister of truth, the First Amendment no longer applies in this country because Russia and systemic racism. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JANKOWICZ: It’s clear that actors like Russia are using those internal fissures, things like our systemic racism here in the United States, things like economic inequality to amplify these issues and really make us distrust the system.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARLSON: So we reached out to DHS, the law enforcement agency now in charge of policing speech about Nina Jankowicz and her plans to censor you from saying what you think is true, and they assured us that they weren’t going to do that. They’re going to focus on human smuggling and Russia propaganda on Ukraine.First of all, it’s not their job to decide what you learn about the border or Russia or Ukraine. It’s your job. You’re an adult. You can read whatever you want, but of course it’s not about that anyway.If you read Jankowicz’s book, which we did, you will realize very quickly she was hired to police domestic social media use. Period. Quote: “I have hope we can change the norms by which our online ecosystem is governed,” she wrote in a typically illiterate sentence. This is what our colleges are producing: Morons who can’t even write in English.Later in the book, she encourages women to go to law enforcement if they see something online they don’t like on Twitter. She called that quote, “an important step in the denormalization of women’s treatment online.”It is hard to even believe our system produces people like this. She is an illiterate fascist.In another book, Jankowicz made it clear that she’s not in favor of government regulation of social media when it allows conservatives to speak freely. So, she devotes an entire chapter to criticizing the country of Poland for establishing its own Ministry of Digital Affairs. Polish officials said their ministry was a way to quote, “deal with rampant online censorship of conservatives and social networks,” but she’s against that. She’s against the anti-censorship program. She’s for censorship.She wrote that Poland is making a big mistake in pulling back censorship and we’re quoting: “Poland’s nearsightedness is leaving it extremely vulnerable,” she wrote, and the solution, she wrote back, is for the U.S. government to quote: “Lead in regulating and conducting oversight” of people who disagree with the Democratic Party on Twitter. So, the truth was never the goal. And we’re quoting again: “We are not even sure that facts can prevail over disinformation,” Jankowicz wrote. We must first begin with addressing social media.Just to be totally clear, the means of the distribution of information are the key to their rule. It’s all they have. They have nothing but that. If you knew what was actually going on, you wouldn’t put up with this for a second, and they know that, and the Biden administration knew that Jankowicz wrote all of this. That’s why they hired her.What you’re seeing is a full-scale attack on free speech in a country that has been free for nearly 250 years and it is happening at the direction of the U.S. government through a law enforcement agency.We can reveal that Biden’s Pentagon, another group with guns, awarded a $750,000.00 contract to a group called NewsGuard. Now, that contract is for misinformation fingerprints. NewsGuard is an organization that claims to fight, quote, “misinformation,” but in practice is a censorship organization. It targets anyone who challenges the people in power.NewsGuard is currently preparing a blacklist of sites that contradict the national security state’s talking points on Ukraine and Russia.So this week, NewsGuard wrote a threatening e-mail to the news site Grayzone, informing The Grayzone that they’re spreading “disinformation” because they’re not reading a script. So, here’s how the editor of The Grayzone, Max Blumenthal, responded. He wrote this: “Do you seriously expect us to grovel for approval from the same tentacle of the national security state and financial oligarchy that has rated CNN as a highly credible news source and whose Board of Advisors is a grotesque gallery of corporate propagandist spooks, documented liars and war criminals who’ve never faced a scintilla of accountability for their actions?”Kind of overheated language. Is it true? Yes. Every word of it.So, when Joe Biden’s censors come, that’s the way you respond. “Hey, pal, up yours. You want some disinformation? Here you go.” You are a free person in a free country, and no law enforcement agency can ever tell you what to think or say. Period.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter@jeff_poor"

(AP) — A huge fire at an apartment building under construction in suburban Kansas City has sparked fires at several homes blocks away.The eight-alarm fire broke out about 3:30 p.m. Monday at the multimillion-dollar CityPlace development in Overland Park, Kansas, sending plumes of smoke and embers toward homes in the suburban neighborhood nearby, The Kansas City Star reported (https://bit.ly/2nLM3Hg ).Once one roof caught fire, embers jumped from roof to roof, spreading the blaze, said Overland Park Fire Department spokesman Jason Rhodes.“It’s a bit of a war zone down there frankly,” Rhodes said. No serious injuries were reported, although one firefighter suffered a minor injury, he said.Some residents have been evacuated as a precaution.Neighborhood residents described hearing an explosion before debris fell on houses.“It sounded like a bomb,” said Juan Roque.Rhodes said it was largest fire he had seen in his 10-year career with the fire department.“Nothing of this magnitude,” he said. “This is big.”When embers started flying through the nearby neighborhood after the fire broke out, residents took their cars out of their garages in case they needed to flee.“It was unbelievable,” said resident Skip Willrett, adding the building where the blaze started is “completely gone.”Fires continued to break out at surrounding houses two hours after the first blaze.“They’re breaking out quickly,” Rhodes said. “It’s a very active situation.”Rhodes said he saw at least 12 houses on fire, but the number could be greater.“The wind is not helping us,” he added.Neighboring fire departments are helping the Overland Park Fire Department battle the blazes.Ken Block with Block Real Estate, the CityPlace developer, said in a statement that they are grateful for all the fire departments for “their heroic efforts.”“Our thoughts and prayers remain with those who are affected and will continue to be affected by this event,” Block said."

He said of Greenspun, who had joined Obama and Jeter for the round, “He and Derek Jeter stole money from me at Shadow Creek. It was clearly a set up, because when we got to the practice range, he was shanking balls everywhere. I said, ‘You play golf Derek?’ And he said, ‘I just started two weeks ago.’”Obama alleged that he and Greenspun gave 30 strokes, then realized they had been suckered on the very first hole. He joked, “We had to take a picture of me handing Derek Jeter money at the end of the game. Despite that, Brian is a great friend.”The guests, who paid up to $33,400 apiece to bask in the light of Obama’s reflections, may have figured out that once Obama heads in any direction, he refuses to acknowledge he’s made a mistake. His apparent golfing ineptitude continues despite the nearly250 roundsand 1,100 hours of golf he has played since his inaugural in 2009.Jeter may have been looking to salvage some of the exorbitant taxes he has paid since Obama’s inaugural. He hasearned$103.9 million in salary since that time. With his salary in the 40% tax bracket, that would leave him paying roughly $40 million."

But his road to the final wasn’t easy. He was pushed to three sets in his opening match against Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay and saved five match points to defeat second seed Jeremy Chardy of France in the second round.Ruud, 20, was seeking to become the first Norwegian to win an ATP Tour title. Ruud’s father, Christian, was the last player from Norway to reach an ATP Tour finishing runner-up in 1995 at Bastad, Sweden. Christian Ruud competed on the Tour for a decade.Like Garin, Ruud has been impressive on clay this season. He reached the quarter-finals in February at the Rio Open and then advanced to the semi-finals at the Brazil Open."

7263673855,https://www.breitbart.com/news/nasa-rover-finds-life-in-subsurface-soil-collected-from-mars-like-atacama-desert/,NASA rover finds life in subsurface soil collected from Mars-like Atacama desert,"Feb. 28 (UPI) — Scientists have identified unique, salt-resistant bacteria living beneath the surface of Chile’s Atacama desert, the most Mars-like environment on Earth.Researchers used a robotic rover designed by NASA engineers to successfully collect subsurface soil samples and locate sparse patches of microbes. The test mission will help NASA scientists prepare for the search for life during future planned Mars missions.Both NASA and the European Space Agency plan to launch Martian rover deployment missions in 2020. ESA has been testing rover models in the Moroccan Sahara.During the recent tests in Chile, researchers found small patchers of microbes living in water-starved, nutrient-poor soils beneath the desert surface.“We have shown that a robotic rover can recover subsurface soil in the most Mars-like desert on Earth,” Stephen Pointing, a professor of environmental science at the Yale-NUS College in Singapore, said in a news release. “This is important because most scientists agree that any life on Mars would have to occur below the surface to escape the harsh surface conditions where high radiation, low temperature and lack of water make life unlikely.”“We found microbes adapted to high salt levels, similar to what may be expected in the Martian subsurface,” Pointing said. “These microbes are very different from those previously known to occur on the surface of deserts.”Like the dirt and dust on Mars, soil in Chile’s Atacama Desert is very salty and subject to intense UV radiation. Liquid water is nonexistent on Mars. Chile’s desert soils often go decades without rain.The latest research — published this week in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology — proved microbes can survive Atacama’s hard, Mars-like conditions.NASA’s autonomous test rover and its soil-sampling technology was developed by engineers at Carnegie-Mellon’s Robotics Institute. When scientists compared soil samples collected by the rover with sample collected by hand, they found similar microbial communities.Both samples hosted extremely patchy patterns of microbes.“These results confirm a basic ecological rule that microbial life is patchy in Earth’s most extreme habitats, which hints that past or present life on other planets may also exhibit patchiness,” according to SETI Institute scientists Nathalie Cabrol and Kim Warren-Rhodes. “While this will make detection more challenging, our findings provide possible signposts to guide the exploration for life on Mars, demonstrating that it is possible to detect life with smart robotic search and sampling strategies.”"

I call B.S.”Brown said he “would never say there’s no chance” that a body could have floated in the French Quarter, but asked to “envision” what Williams is saying:You are sitting in the French Quarter. You’re not in the Ninth Ward, you’re not in the poor parts of the city, you’re not in the areas that were flooded where people had hundreds of thousands of dollars in value in homes next to a levy, where the water is in the third and fourth floors of the homes. You’re sitting in your robe, in a French Quarter hotel, looking out your window and claiming you see a body float by? Give me an effing break.Williams also claimed that he had dysentery, but Brown said that he has “never heard, never heard, of dysentery in Hurricane Katrina, anywhere. Biloxi [Mississippi] all the way to the Texas border, I never heard of one case of dysentery.”“If you truly have dysentery, you’re not standing up in front of a camera, in front of national news people, giving a report and then going back and sitting on the commode or hunched in your bed for the next five hours and then get up and do it again,” he told theTimes.“If you truly have dysentery, you’re down and out.”Williams has also claimed that his five-star hotel was overrun by gangs and that he was even planning to barter for his life with vienna sausages. But those “stories”are curiously never mentionedin his Katrina diaries.NBC News isinvestigatingWilliams,the face of its news division, and his history of fabrications."

At the time of the murder, Arciniega-Saenz was out on bail,accordingtoLas Cruces Sun-News.When arrested after Garcia’s mutilated body was found 10 yards from his head, Arciniega-Saenz allegedly confessed to the murder, telling investigators that he was seeking revenge because he believed Garcia had raped his wife four years prior.At the park where Garcia’s body was found, Arciniega-Saenz allegedly confessed to confronting the man before stabbing him with a switchblade, decapitating him, and then playing “soccer with his head,” according to an affidavit.Arciniega-Saenz allegedly told investigators he kicked Garcia’s decapitated head at about 14 vehicles nearby.CBS 4 Newsreportedthat Arciniega-Saenz had an extensive criminal record. In 2017, he was accused of first-degree murder but a year later, the charges were dropped. In May, Arciniega-Saenz was arrested when he was caught throwing rocks at businesses.Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seemingly confirmed to Breitbart News that Arciniega-Saenz is an illegal alien in the United States with an ICE detainer on him, requesting that local authorities do not release him from jail until they can assume custody.“Under federal law, ICE has the authority to lodge immigration detainers with law enforcement partners who have custody of individuals arrested on criminal charges and who ICE has probable cause to believe are removable noncitizens,” an ICE official told Breitbart News.“The detainer form asks the other law enforcement agency to notify ICE in advance of release and to maintain custody of the noncitizen for a brief period of time so that ICE can take custody of that person in a safe and secure setting upon release from that agency’s custody,” the official said.Arciniega-Saenz is being held at the Dona Ana County Detention Center without bail.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

As long as you are a media leftist, you will always have credibility and have a seat at the table of activist, old media types.Dan Rather, he of the2004 fake documents scandalthat attempted to get John Kerry elected over George W. Bush, is still called upon for his opinion by certain cable news networks. Seriously? Are there any “deal-breakers” that disqualify you at some point on the left? Guess not.Rather was hanging out with four other leftists on “The Chris Matthews Show”  this weekend (this is can’t-miss TV, if you count watching groupthink and close-mindedness as entertaining). Rather is doing some sort of “special” on the Occupy Wall Street protests, telling us what they are really all about and getting to the bottom of the story. He will try to tell us the truth this time. Honest.I hope Rather’s report doesn’t miss thisstrange group chant.The masses refer to themselves as “the Block” and they must all speak in unison, the type of group-speak that Stalin would be proud of.   Watch this entire video and you’ll find humor in how this small, homogenized group cannot decide on a simple question of whether one of their ideological own, Congressman John Lewis, should speak. You wanna see gridlock, this is is gridlock at its finest–big government in a microcosm. What if they had to decide a serious issue, like who should use the toilet and when? Were “Saturday Night Live” impartial, they could kill with a parody of this. My favorite part is about eight minutes in when the guy with a megaphone (hey, that’s unfair that less than 1% of the crowd gets the megaphone!) does a series of mic checks and the crowd yells “mic check” every time he does a mic check. You can’t make this stuff up.I also hope Dan doesn’t leave out the arrests and thestorming of the Air and Space Museum.What did the Air and Space Museum do to these people? Hummmm—imagine how the networks would cover the tea party doing things like this.In Las Vegas, the “occupiers” marched on the Statue of Liberty in front of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino. Now, they said it was to march on the symbols of Wall Street, but there are no symbols of Wall Street at that casino, unless they just wanted to make a statement that a business itself is a symbol of Wall Street. Have no doubt, these marches are against America, capitalism and businesses. Thus, marching on the Statue of Liberty seems to fit right in with this group.Dan brought this gem to the Matthews Show when talking about the protest group:“[Occupy Wall Street] could become a mirror image of the tea party on the left and towards the center,” he said. “It has the potential, mark the word potential, to be on the left and edge into the center of what the tea party  has been on the right.”Center? He sees this group as having the potential to represent the center in this country?   Maybe Dan thinksthis neeked guyon the streets of San Francisco at the OccupyBizzareStreet rally has the potential to be in the center of American politics. The years have not been kind to Dan.Then, Chris Matthews asks this of the OccupyWeirdStreet movement:   “How can the president, can the president tap into this; is he doing anything that is convincing that he is angry at this inequality?” Chris, what have you been tuned into lately? Have you missed the last year or so of Barack Obama news conferences and speeches? Obama is fueling this movement; he is their leader. Chris, have you not heard about increased taxes on “millionaires and billionaires?” Read the signs at the rally’s and tell me these people aren’t in lockstep with the White House. Who do you think they will vote for in 2012? Michele Bachmann?Oh yes, we all know Obama takes millions in campaign donations from Wall Street bankers and his bailout gave them hundreds of billions of our tax dollars, but this crowd on the streets doesn’t know or care about that. They watch MSNBC, which guarantees their ignorance. They are jealous of the Tea Party and just want to march for something, anything. Truth be known, the tea party  and these latest protests have something very important in common. They both opposed the bailouts. Analyze that for a moment. There’s your center right there, Dan Rather.Chris also asked what the risk was if Obama and the Democrats join with the protestors. Seriously? If? Chris, they already have–again, they fueled these protests. You can’t tell anybody you don’t know who those protesters are out there.Matthews and Rather are the perfect combo for this show. They should chant in unison next time they are on, just like the folks at the Atlanta Rally … but keep their clothes on."

Several days earlier, a snorkeler found the carcass of an 18-foot oarfish off Catalina Island and dragged it to shore with some help.The rarely seen deep sea-dwelling creatures, which can grow to more than 50 feet, may be the inspiration of sea monsters found in literature and throughout history. Photos of the oarfish have circulated widely online, spurring general interest in the mysterious creature but contributing little to scientists’ knowledge of the fish.Here’s a closer look at the oarfish:HOW OFTEN DO THEY VENTURE CLOSE TO SHORE?Oarfish beach themselves around the world. Every so often, one wanders to the Southern California coast.In 2010, a 12-foot oarfish washed ashore in Malibu. The most recent stranding before last week’s sightings occurred in 2011 when a 14-foot oarfish was found on a beach near the Vandenberg Air Force Base, about 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles, said Rick Feeney of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.HOW DID THE TWO OARFISH DIE?While necropsies _ the animal version of an autopsy _ were done on the oarfish, the cause of death remains unknown. Scientists said the deaths may forever remain a mystery. The smaller oarfish appeared to be in good health before it died and there were no signs of shark bites.Oarfish are thought to be poor swimmers and it’s possible that the ones found last week got caught in a current that pushed them to coastal waters, marine experts said.“If they get disoriented and into the surf zone, they’ll probably have trouble maneuvering back out to sea,” said Phil Hastings, curator of the marine vertebrate collection at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.WHY IS SO LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT OARFISH?Oarfish are highly evolved. They tend to remain quiet in the deep ocean, luring smaller fish toward them.Since they’re are found in tropical waters 3,000 feet deep, scientists don’t get many opportunities to study these serpent-like creatures. The dead oarfish that float ashore don’t tell the whole story. It’s like trying to study deer that end up in the windshield, said Milton Love, a marine biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.“You wouldn’t know much about deer based on roadkill,” he said.WHAT’S NEXT?Scientists have dissected the oarfish, preserved some tissue and organs, and planned to send samples to researchers around the world to examine.___Follow Alicia Chang at http://twitter.com/SciWriAlicia"
7539293989,https://www.breitbart.com/news/hemp-used-for-construction-gains-popularity-in-u-s/,Hemp used for construction gains popularity in U.S.,"July 18 (UPI) — Builders who use natural materials in the United States have seen interest grow in “hempcrete,” a renewable building material made with hemp that can take the place of traditional drywall, insulation and siding.Since the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp, the construction material — used for 30 years in Europe — has captured the imagination of American builders and homeowners.“This year is the biggest year in hemp construction and it’s really just beginning,” said Tommy Gibbons of Ketchum, Idaho-based Hempitecture Inc.Chipped hemp bark, lime binder and water are mixed together to make hempcrete. The material dries to a strong, stonelike substance that’s fireproof, mold-proof and insect-proof.Walls can be constructed by crews without power tools who mix the ingredients together in buckets and pour them into wooden forms.In Bellingham, Wash., homeowner Pamela Bosch worked with Hempitecture to build a 2,000-square-foot hempcrete addition to her 1898 Highland Hemp House that overlooks the San Juan Islands.“It’s not a small experiment; it’s a legacy-size demonstration,” Bosch said.She started her renovation looking for “natural insulation that didn’t have toxic fiberglass or foam,” she said. “I read about how hempcrete is used in Europe and never looked back.”Helps the airHempcrete is a “carbon-negative” building material. The cellulose inside 2.5 acres of hemp can absorb more than 22 tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to an Australian study. Hempcrete walls continue to sequester greenhouse gases as they cure.The material is an antidote to the polluting construction industry, which belches out water and air pollution and fills landfills, said hempcrete pioneer Steve Allin, of Kerry, Ireland. Allin’s 2005 book, Building with Hemp and his workshops in the United States have been the catalyst for hundreds of builders to try their own hempcrete projects.Hempcrete takes the place of fiberglass insulation and sheet rock, and can be covered with a lime plaster for smooth walls. It is not load-bearing like sand-and-gravel concrete, but can be built around a supporting timber frame.The 9- to 12-inch-thick walls create an insulation envelope, keeping the house cool in summer and warm in winter. Walls also “breathe” with vapor permeability that keeps air inside fresh and prevents mold rot, according to European natural builder standards.Homeowners should consider hempcrete for remodeling and repairs, Allin said. “Not all that many people get to build their own house. It’s not all about luxury homes.”Hempcrete does not require expensive building equipment, and can be applied by teams of relatively unskilled workers, he said. “Hempcrete can be built with community participation on a very local level.”Not easy to obtainBut it’s not so easy to build a hempcrete house in the United States.For one thing, hemp hurd, the plant material, is tough to acquire locally. Bosch and others have had to import hurd from Europe.Farmers in this country have only just begun to grow hemp after it was formerly illegal in the U.S. for 80 years because of its relationship to its cousin, marijuana.But U.S. farmers appear more interested in growing the crop for CBD. That requires a short bushy plant, not the tall reed-like fiber variety. If farmers do grow the fiber plant, very few U.S. factories can process the crop.“We need many processing facilities on the state level,” said civil engineer and hempcrete builder Sergiy “Doctor Hemphouse” Kovalenskov of Hempire USA in Los Angeles.The secret to sustainability is working with local farmers who can grow hemp close to the site, Kovalenskov said, adding, “There’s no point in shipping hemp hurd from Poland when it could be grown locally.”Kelly Thornton of Boulder, Colo.-based Left Hand Hemp, said “there should be millions of acres grown and processing facilities around the country like silos for the farmers to bring in their crops.” The lack of hemp processing facilities is the bottleneck unlocking the potential of hemp’s many uses, he said.Another challenge for builders is that hempcrete has not yet been incorporated into building codes, said John Patterson, a 30-year expert carpenter of Fort Collins, Colo., who constructs “tiny hemp houses.”Certifications soughtU.S. hemp builders plan to form a trade association this year whose goal would be creating a path to include hempcrete in residential building codes. The group also would submit the material to U.S. Green Building Council, which grants LEED certification for sustainable buildings, Patterson said.Other natural-materials building processes, such as strawbale construction, have paved the way for hempcrete in the International Code Council’s International Building Code.Without proper certifications, it’s tough to acquire home insurance, building permits and construction professionals who will sign off on hempcrete projects.“We are working our butts off trying to get architects and engineers and building officials to understand that hempcrete can meet or exceed the intent of the code,” Patterson said.This year, some architects have taken notice of the material’s potential.In June, students used hempcrete to insulate a small building on the Princeton University campus at the School of Architecture’s Embodied Computation Lab, Gibbons said.“The material itself is exceptional, and it’s incredibly exciting that our students got to see it and apply it with a hands-on experience,” said Grey Wartinger, manager of digital fabrication, research and technologies at the lab.Lower pricesGibbons sees hempcrete as a way to build attainable homes for lower prices with hempcrete prefabricated walls, bricks, a spray application and even eventual 3-D printing of hempcrete structures.“We’ve seen the economics of this material, and how it can create jobs and build homes. We can help solve a lot of insecurity for people in my generation who can’t afford their own shelter,” Gibbons said.Hempcrete is attracting homeowners who want a “rapidly renewable plant-based material that can change our manufacturing processes and move us away from oil,” homeowner Bosch said.For hempcrete pioneer Allin, the big picture for hemp is its role in fighting climate change.“We need solutions. We’ve spent the last 20 years telling people about climate change, and with hempcrete, we have this path to reduce our carbon in the construction industry,” he said."

4999403804,http://www.breitbart.com/news/in-bumpy-coronation-trump-takes-the-crown/,"In bumpy coronation, Trump takes the crown","CLEVELAND (AP) — The art of the coronation has taken something of a beating at the Republican National Convention. Nevertheless, Donald Trump now has the crown — and a final chance to summon unity from the party’s restive ranks in the ritual’s closing days.The roll call of the states Tuesday night delivered Trump the nomination, which he welcomed from afar in a videotaped message saying “This is a movement, but we have to go all the way.” House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that Trump had amassed 1,725 delegates, more than triple the number of his nearest competitor, the fruits of a political phenomenon without parallel in modern times.Day 3 of the convention will bring two conservative stalwarts to the stage: Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a favorite of evangelicals; and the nominee’s most tenacious challenger in the primaries, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the man Trump used to call  “Lyin’ Ted.”Pence is heartily on board the Trump bandwagon; Cruz isn’t yet, nor are many of his supporters in Cleveland. The senator’s scheduled prime-time address will be keenly watched as a barometer of the party’s fighting spirit as the GOP turns to the fall campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, who accepts her nomination next week.Trump, the in-your-face outsider, won at the cost of alienating many traditional Republicans both on the right and in the center, and the divide has spilled over into the convention, though without overwhelming it.  The roll call unfolded largely according to plan after a day dominated by unwelcome attention over passages from an eight-year-old Michelle Obama speech that made their way into Melania Trump’s address to the convention, almost word for word, the night before.This, after unwelcome attention over a loud if short-lived protest on opening day over convention rules aimed at tamping down any remaining threat to Trump’s triumph.Tuesday night, speaker after speaker stepped forward to denounce Clinton, none to greater effect with the crowd than New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.The governor, a dropout in the GOP presidential race who ended up on the short list for Trump’s running mate, energized the hall as he ticked through numerous accusations of wrongdoing against Clinton and implored delegates to shout “guilty.” They not only did that, but interrupted him with shouts of “Lock her up.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the crowd scandal follows Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton “like flies.”Two of Trump’s children testified to his character. “For my father, impossible is just the starting point,” said Donald Trump Jr., eldest of the nominee’s five children. Tiffany Trump, 22, said her dad is a “natural-born encourager” and she recalled the notes he wrote on her report cards.“For my father, impossible is just the starting point,” Trump’s son Donald said. Questions about plagiarism surfaced for a second day in a row, this time in the eldest son’s speech. But F.H. Buckley, the writer behind the original work in question this time — an article in The American Conservative — said he was a principal speechwriter for the younger Trump and said the campaign did nothing wrong.On the convention floor, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina was feeling the fighting spirit, telling reporters, “It’s all starting to gel.” Not so for Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, a leader of the outmaneuvered anti-Trump contingent, who said it’s time to “cancel the convention, stop the sham,” and who warned Trump might run into a “show of displeasure” in his acceptance speech ending the convention Thursday night. Colorado cast most of its votes for Cruz.Cruz was not expected to offer a full-throated endorsement in his speech, nor to rock the boat too much, given that his remarks were being vetted by Trump’s people. In this at times undisciplined enterprise, though, who knew?The convention offers Trump one of his best chances to convince voters he’s better suited for the presidency than Clinton. But the rocky start raised questions about his oversight of his campaign, which gives voters a window into how a candidate might handle the pressures of the presidency.The plagiarism accusations centered on Monday night’s well-received speech by Trump’s wife, Melania. Two passages were nearly identical to a 2008 Democratic convention address by Mrs. Obama.Trump’s campaign chief, Paul Manafort, managed only to keep the controversy alive by insisting there was no evidence of plagiarism, an untenable assertion given the similarities. In contrast, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said he “probably” would have fired his own speechwriters under similar circumstances.Donald Trump Jr. told reporters he was proud of Mrs. Trump’s speech but people in the campaign “should have cleaned it up better.”As large and challenging as political conventions are, they pale in comparison with the scope of a president’s responsibilities, and sloppiness in Cleveland could hint at what a Trump presidency could look like.Whether that matters to voters, though, is another question. The billionaire has survived, even prospered through, a series of contentious episodes that might have consumed a conventional politician — or a conventional convention.___Woodward reported from Washington."

He says earnings would be reduced by 10 cents per share in the “worst case.”The impact on United Technologies would be limited this year, with more of an impact in 2014, he said.“I would love it be solved, but it’s very manageable,” he said.United Technologies posted 2012 earnings from continuing operations of $5.35 per share. Subsidiaries of the Hartford, Conn., conglomerate include military contractors such as jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky Aircraft, which manufactures helicopters.Chenevert said the impact would be mostly on repair and maintenance of aerospace parts. The earnings hit is accounted for in 2013 guidance of $5.85 to $6.15 per share, he said.Questioned about what United Technologies will do with its cash, Chenevert said the company is committed to continuing dividend payments, is paying down debt and has a $1 billion placeholder for mergers and acquisitions.But following its $18.4 billion purchase of airplane parts maker Goodrich Corp., United Technologies will commit only to small acquisitions for subsidiaries Carrier heating and ventilating equipment or Otis elevator, Chenevert said.“We did the big deal,” he said. “Now we’re integrating and executing.”United Technologies reported $4.82 billion in cash at the end of 2012, down 19 percent from 2011.The company announced earlier this month it may buy back up to 60 million shares, replacing an approximately $4.3 billion stock buyback program which began almost three years ago and is nearly spent. It expects repurchases to total about $1 billion this year.Companies buy back stock to reward shareholders since reducing the number of stock outstanding can lift earnings per share."

He added that the kidnappers’ vehicle had broken down, possibly prompting their decision to kill the captives.The director of Radio France Internationale confirmed multiple arrests had been made, although French government authorities gave no confirmations. What remained unclear was who the kidnappers were, and whether they had ties to ethnic Tuareg separatists or al-Qaida militants active in the region.The slayings of Ghislaine Dupont, 57, a senior correspondent, and Claude Verlon, 55, a production technician, stunned France and were an unheard of assault on Western journalists in Mali, where a French-led military operation this year aimed to clear out Islamic extremists who had taken over the vast north.The veteran journalists were taken Saturday in the troubled northern city of Kidal, just after finishing an interview with a Tuareg rebel leader.Their bodies were found later that day 12 kilometers (7 miles) outside the city, a few yards from what was believed to be the kidnappers’ getaway vehicle, the make and model of which were not immediately clear.French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the pair were “coldly assassinated,” with Dupont shot twice in the chest and Verlon shot three times in the head.The Malian military officer, who is involved in intelligence work, said the vehicle’s steering wheel had broken, possibly due to some sort of accident. Investigators are pursuing the theory that the abductors, once without a functioning vehicle, decided it was easier to shoot the hostages than take them along on foot.The Malian official could not be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press on the record. Most Westerners abducted in the region have been held for ransom – believed to be a particularly lucrative source of income for Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, the terror network’s branch in the area.At least one of the five people arrested by France’s Serval force is believed to be among the four attackers witnesses reported seeing during the abduction, the Malian official said. The suspects have been transferred from Kidal to Gao, where French forces have a base.RFI director Cecile Megie confirmed Monday that there had been arrests, but offered no details in an interview with the iTele network. Fabius could not confirm the arrests, and France’s Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The slain journalists’ bodies were taken to Mali’s capital, Bamako, over the weekend. On Monday evening, their coffins were placed on stands on an airport tarmac, and Malian officials came to pay their respects alongside Dupont and Verlon’s editors. Their remains are expected to arrive in Paris via a special flight on Tuesday.Mali has been in turmoil for more than a year, including experiencing a coup and a takeover of the north by various rebel groups. Ethnic Tuareg rebels seized control of much of the north before being pushed out by al-Qaida fighters, who imposed harsh Islamic law, including hacking off the hands of alleged thieves.France, deeply concerned by al-Qaida’s ascendance in its former colony, staged an intervention in January that succeeded in liberating most of the north from the religious radicals. Kidal, however, remains in limbo.France did nothing to uproot the Tuaregs’ National Movement for the Liberation of the Azawad, or NMLA, and those fighters still move freely in the town. Dupont and Verlon had just finished interviewing the acting head of the NMLA, Ambeiry Ag Rhissa, when they were grabbed outside his house.The identity of the abductors remained unclear Monday.Witnesses confirmed that the kidnappers were speaking Tamashek, the Tuareg language. Both the NMLA and Ansar Dine, an extremist group allied with al-Qaida, are predominantly made up of Tamashek-speaking fighters.Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, which has earned an estimated $89 million from ransoming dozens of foreigners, according to global intelligence group Stratfor, is primarily composed of Arabic speakers. However, it has previously relied on Tuareg groups to grab hostages in northern Mali, who are then sold to the al-Qaida franchise.A special email address set up by RFI to allow people to send condolences has been flooded with messages from Dupont and Verlon’s former listeners. Both had had lengthy careers; Dupont had spent 10 years covering the conflict in Congo.Malian politician Tiebile Drame, who knew Dupont, wrote a poem for her that was published in Monday’s edition of Le Monde newspaper:___Associated Press writer Lori Hinnant contributed from Paris."

The vote once due to be held in November has been postponed indefinitely.The Catholic church has been mediating talks between Kabila’s party and opposition parties, though those discussions are now on hold until Wednesday.The opposition has not called for demonstrations, though many observers expect Kabila’s opponents to take to the streets as they did earlier this year when the electoral commission failed to call the election.

No suspects have been detained yet, Swedish media reported.Swedish police received an alert Tuesday afternoon that several loud bangs were heard in one of the districts of the city. Police soon arrived at the scene with several patrols.According to preliminary information, at least three people were taken to hospital with suspected gunshot wounds, Swedish police say. A man in his 20s, a man in his 30s and a woman in her 60s have serious injuries, according to police, who added there’s a possibility the number of wounded will still rise.The police investigation is focused on finding where precisely the shooting took place, as there were reports of shots being fired around the city and its surrounding areas.The Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that one or more perpetrators left the main scene of the shooting by motorcycle. Police wouldn’t confirm that information.There was no immediate information on the cause of the shooting, but it comes amid a rise in gun violence in the Scandinavian nation.A report by the Swedish national council for crime prevention said earlier this year that Sweden is the only European country where fatal shootings have risen significantly since 2000, primarily because of the violent activities of organized criminal gangs.“We are currently working to get an overview of how many are injured. An ambulance has been called to the scene,” police spokesman Richard Lundqvist was quoted as telling local newspaper Sydsvenskan.On Monday evening, there were also reports of shootings in the same area in Kristianstad, the Swedish news agency TT reported."
5278833157,http://www.breitbart.com/news/bird-colors-and-geography-new-study-sheds-light-plumage-evolution/,Bird colors and geography: New study sheds light plumage evolution,"OKINAWA, Japan, Nov. 4 (UPI) — Everything seems brighter in the tropics: the sky, the ocean, the houses, the birds. Think tropics and brightly feathered toucans and parrots come to mind. Why is that?Some biologists have suggested the rich biodiversity of the tropics — and the competition for mates — drives brighter and brighter patterns. But new research suggests otherwise.Scientist Nicholas Friedman found birds from the tropics aren’t any more likely to be brightly colored than their peers in more temperate regions.For his study, Friedman looked to Australia, the birthplace of songbirds. Evolutionary biologists believe songbirds began diversifying on the continent 30 million years ago, before departing to colonize other parts of the planet.Friedman analyzed the color patterns of 137 species from two major songbird families. He and his colleagues at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University then built a model to study the link between color, evolutionary relationships and geographic factors, including vegetation, precipitation, and humidity.The results showed life in the tropics doesn’t encourage more colorful feathers.“If you look at birds in the tropics, there are a lot of colorful birds that stand out,” Friedman said in a news release. “But there are really more species in general there, and there are just as many more of the little brown ones.”“Instead, birds living in the harsh arid climates of inland Australia tended to have fancier colors than those in the lush tropical islands,” he added. “Since desert birds have to scramble for mates during the wet season, we think they may be evolving colors that can attract mates quickly.”The new findings — published in the journal Global Ecology and Biogeography — don’t suggest geography and color are unrelated. Friedman argues the opposite, in fact. But the relationship isn’t expressed across a scale from dull to colorful.“The pattern is really clear,” Friedman said, “birds living in the desert tend to be more grey on their backs, while birds living in the forest have evolved to be more of a dark green — we think they are evolving these colors to match their background.”"

Iceland needed to win by four points or more to win a tiebreaker over Georgia for the World Cup berth.It came up one point short. Both teams finished qualifying with 5-5 records, with the tiebreaker going to Georgia by the slimmest of margins.Iceland had a 3-point try by Elvar Fridriksson— its best shooter — rim out with about 3 seconds remaining, and Georgia held on for the loss that really was a win.“Amazing. I’m so happy, man,” said Georgia’s Thaddus McFadden, a Michigan-born guard who played at the junior college and Division II levels before embarking on what’s now a 14-year pro career overseas. “I may mess around and cry. This means so much to everybody. I’m just so happy.”Georgia beat Iceland by three points in a qualifying game in November. For Iceland to have advanced, it needed to win by four to claim the head-to-head tiebreaker; Georgia held other tiebreakers, and those were its ticket to the World Cup.“Fought to the very end and if you told me before the game or at the start of these 10-game qualifications that it would come down to one shot by our best shooter, then I would take it,” Iceland coach Craig Pedersen said. “But it was a couple of centimeters off. And congratulations to Georgia.”Georgia — a first-time World Cup qualifier — joined nine other European teams as having clinched berths in this summer’s tournament. Those nine who qualified before Sunday are Latvia, Greece, Germany, Finland, Slovenia, France, Lithuania, Spain and Italy.Montenegro also qualified on Sunday, clinching its spot with an 88-70 win over Czech Republic.The last World Cup spot of the 12 allocated to Europe will be claimed Monday, going to either Serbia or Belgium.Serbia will advance if it beats Great Britain. if Serbia loses that game, Belgium would advance by beating Turkey. And if Belgium loses, Serbia advances regardless of its Monday result.AMERICAS REGIONThe U.S. and Canada have clinched World Cup berths. There are six teams — Brazil, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Argentina — playing their final qualifying games Sunday night, and five of them will advance to the tournament.AFRICA REGIONCape Verde is now the smallest nation — population of just under 600,000 — ever to qualify for the World Cup. It topped Ivory Coast 79-64 on Sunday to claim the last spot allocated to African nations.It’s Cape Verde’s first trip to the World Cup. Fellow first-time qualifier South Sudan, along with Ivory Coast, Angola and Egypt are also set to be Africa’s five World Cup representatives.ASIA REGIONIran grabbed the last available spot from Asia on Sunday, clinching its berth when Kazakhstan lost to Australia 98-53.Kazakhstan was the only other team still in the running for the final spot. Iran lost to China 86-74 on Sunday, but only needed a win or a Kazakhstan loss to qualify.Iran joins co-hosts Philippines and Japan, along with Lebanon, New Zealand, Australia, China, and Jordan as Asia’s eight World Cup qualifiers.___AP sports:https://apnews.com/hub/sportsandhttps://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

Rodriguez suffered a fractured face during the arrest.This summer, Rodriguez filed a federal lawsuit against the arresting officers and the City of Knoxville.According to thereportby the NBC affiliate, law enforcement had dropped initial resisting arrest and assault charges against Rodriguez in November 2014 because they were under the impression that he was to be repatriated. Instead of going to Mexico, Rodriguez came back at the police department with a lawsuit.His repatriation case is still pending in Memphis, WBIR reports.Police released dashcam video of the Rodriguez arrest:It shows Rodriguez being held by the first responding officer with one hand handcuffed, but repeatedly refuses to provide his other hand. Backup officers arrive and are shown pounding on Rodriguez to force him to submit to being restrained.The federal lawsuit against KPD states Rodriguez would not give his hands because the handcuffs were too small and were hurting him. It also claims there was a language barrier, but Rodriguez can be heard speaking English in dashcam videos.Rodriguez’s lawsuit claims the beating caused his injuries, but KPD said the blows shown in the video followed protocol and were delivered to Rodriguez’s shoulder-blade. KPD said the facial injuries occurred when Rodriguez was tackled and his face hit the street.Rodriguez is slated to be arraigned in Knox County Criminal Court on September 10."

He shot and missed just after the final buzzer.“We had a couple of different options,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. Rondo “had a good matchup, but Joe Harris did a nice job on him.”Kevin Love added 12 points and 15 rebounds for the Cavaliers.“That’s quite a homecoming,” said Cleveland coach David Blatt, who grew up in nearby Framingham. “I thought Boston played great basketball for three quarters (and) we waited a long time to get it in gear defensively.”Kelly Olynyk led Boston with a season-high 21 points, and Jared Sullinger and Jeff Green had 19 apiece.Boston grabbed a 103-84 lead on Tyler Zeller’s layup early in the fourth quarter.Then Irving took charge, scoring 13 of Cleveland’s next 15 points and cutting the margin to 107-99 with 8:40 left.James led the Cavaliers in the last six minutes of the quarter with 10 points.

First, I’m not apologizing for my work, nor will I dodge the immediate question. The flags, armbands, and gas mask (and perhaps my use of symmetry?) are all representative of Nazism.But a majority of the recognizable models/symbols are American: MQ9 Reaper Drone, F22 Raptor, Sidewinder missile, security cameras, M60, SWAT uniform, General’s uniform, the Supreme court, and the Lincoln Memorial.What’s also American is the 1st Amendment, which I’ve unexpectedly succeeded in showing how we willfully squeeze ourselves out of that right every day. Despite the fact heavy religious and economic themes were glossed over, there’s also Russian T-90 tanks, Belgian FN FAL, German mp5 (not manufactured until 1966), an Italian Ferrari, and a Vatican Pope.As far as an explanation, I think it’s actually important to remind younger generations of atrocities that occurred in the past as a way to prevent them from happening in the future. And the most effective way of connecting with people today is through social media and pop culture. So if my work is misinterpreted because it’s not a sappy tearjerker, sorry I’m not sorry.

The hope is that lawmakers won’t give their backing if the government intends to push for that sort of deal.Prime Minister Theresa May had argued that the referendum result had given her government the authority to trigger Article 50 without the need to get Parliamentary approval.___10:45 a.m.The lead claimant in the High Court case on whether the government can trigger the process of leaving the European Union says the case is about process, not politics.Financial entrepreneur Gina Miller says the proper place for a debate on leaving the EU is in a “sovereign Parliament.” The court agreed.Miller hopes the government will chose not to appeal the High Court ruling Thursday. But the government announced shortly after that it would.May says the June 23 referendum on EU membership gave her a mandate to take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc. She has announced plans to invoke Article 50 of the EU treaty, starting talks on Britain’s future relationship with the single market, by the end of March.___10:35 a.m.The British government says it is disappointed by a High Court ruling against its plans to start EU exit talks.It says in a statement that “we will appeal this judgment.”The High Court ruled Thursday that the government doesn’t have the power to trigger EU exit talks without a vote in Parliament.It says Britons voted to leave the bloc “in a referendum approved by Act of Parliament. And the government is determined to respect the result of the referendum.”___10:10 a.m.In a major blow for Britain’s government, the High Court says the prime minister can’t trigger the U.K.’s exit from the European Union without approval from Parliament.The government is likely to appeal Thursday’s ruling to the Supreme Court.Plans for Brexit are being challenged in a case with major constitutional implications, hinging on the balance of power between Parliament and the government.Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will launch exit negotiations with the EU by March 31.

Former Attorney General William Barr became a veritable celebrity under Trump, after he spun the Russia report from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller favorably for the president, even though Mueller pointedly said he could not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr later moved to drop the criminal charges against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and publicly overturned his own prosecutor’s recommended prison sentence for another convicted Trump ally, Roger Stone.But not evenBarr made it to the end of the Trump administration; he resigned in December, weeks after he said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential race, contradicting Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud.On Thursday,Garland signaled in his first address to staff— a formal, 10-minute speech inside the Great Hall at Justice Department headquarters, speaking virtually to staff with about 30 people spread across the large room — the department would return to its normal traditions away from the political sphere. President Joe Biden has also insisted the same.Try though he may to stay out of politics, Garland is facing some immediate political challenges, including overseeing the ongoingcriminal tax investigation into Biden’s son, Hunter, and the investigations and prosecutions stemming from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol when thousands of pro-Trump rioters stormed the building to halt the certification of the election results.The Justice Department also has an ongoing federal probe into the overseas and business dealings of the former New York City mayor andTrump ally Rudy Giuliani,which stalled last year over a dispute about investigative tactics as Trump unsuccessfully sought reelection. And separately,the special counsel investigationinto the origins of the Russia probe, which shadowed Trump’s presidency for more than two years, remains ongoing. Garland will have to decide how to handle it and what to make public.But the nation’s top law enforcement official vowed Thursday that he would prioritize ensuring the department return to prosecutorial norms and work to make the public confident in its independence to serve justice.“Those norms require that like cases be treated alike,” he said. “That there not be one rule for Democrats, and another for Republicans, one rule for friends and another for foes one rule for the powerful, and another for the powerless, one rule for the rich and another for the poor, or different rules, depending upon one’s race or ethnicity.”An experienced judge, Garland held senior positions at the Justice Department decades ago, including as a supervisor in the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which led to the execution of Timothy McVeigh. His experience prosecuting domestic terrorism cases could prove exceptionally valuable as investigations into the Capitol insurrection progress.“When I walked in the door of Main Justice this morning, it really did feel like I was coming home,” Garland said, referring to Justice Department headquarters.Garland arrived for his first day shortly after 9 a.m. and was greeted by several dozen officials in the courtyard of the department’s headquarters. As he hopped out of his SUV, Garland hugged his wife, waved to the crowd and elbow-bumped with his predecessor, acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson, as he walked into the building.About 15 minutes later, he took the oath of office, administered by Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus. A formal ceremonial swearing-in is expected later Thursday with Vice President Kamala Harris.His first briefing was expected to focus on the insurrection and the ongoing investigations by federal prosecutors. So far, about 300 people have been charged with federal crimes, including far-right extremists who are alleged to have been involved in pre-planning and conspiracies to breach the Capitol and assault law enforcement.Garland is expected to be briefed by FBI Director Christopher Wray and top national security officials and will also visit the U.S. attorney’s office to meet with prosecutors who are trying the cases."

I think she’s a third-rate reporter. I think she is frankly, not good at what she does. I think they could do a lot better than Megyn Kelly. I’m going to make a decision with Fox but I probably won’t bother doing the debate. They picked me as number one. Not only number one, number one by far. But probably I won’t be doing the debate. I’m going to have something else in Iowa, do something where we raise money for the veterans and the Wounded Warriors. We’re going to do something simultaneously with the debate. But, most likely I’m not going to do the debate. I didn’t like the fact they sent out press releases toying, talking about Putin and playing games. I don’t know what games Roger Ailes is playing, but what’s wrong over there, something’s wrong. But when they sent out that press release talking about, I said why are these people playing games? Most likely I won’t be doing the debate.”Trump explained one of the causes for his decision was a press release from Fox News and that proclaimed he won’t be toyed with like “everybody else.”See, the point is with me they’re dealing with somebody that’s a little bit different. They can’t toy with me like they toy with everybody else. Let them have their debate and let’s see how they do with the ratings. And I told them, give money to the Wounded Warriors, and give money to the veterans. They’re going to make a fortune with the debate. Let’s see how many people watch. We’ll have our own event, we’ll raise some money for the Wounded Warriors. We’ll raise money for the vets. When they sent out the wise-guy press releases a little while ago.

We must try to minimise any losses for those who are battling for the top places in the rankings.”Russia’s top player Sharapova has played just three Fed Cup ties in her career so far, making her debut in 2008 to help satisfy Olympic Games qualification criteria.After playing again in 2011, she also featured in the quarter-final win over Spain in 2012 in the run-up to the London Games.Tarpishchev said that Sharapova had expressed her desire to play for Russia in this season’s Fed Cup campaign, and that he had been keen to call her into his squad for the later stages of the competition.“If Masha (Sharapova) has a relatively simple tournament schedule ahead without a series of top-class events in America we will call on her,” he said.“But otherwise the trans-Atlantic flights and time zone changes can seriously harden the battle for the top spot in the WTA rankings. We’re not going make her life even tougher.”Tarpishchev said he had an agreement with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Vera Zvonareva, who had both said they were available to play for Russia this season, adding that he could also call Kuznetsova into his team if need be.“It was very important for Svetlana (Kuznetsova) to improve her individual ranking at the beginning of the season and she asked me to release her from playing against Japan,” Tarpishchev said. “She wants to be in the world’s elite and we definitely respect her desire.”"

It is a multilateral accord and there is no sense in renegotiating it,” said Rouhani at a news conference a year on from the deal coming into force.Trump frequently criticised the nuclear deal during campaigning and called for fresh negotiations, but has refused to be drawn on his plans since being elected.His nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has called for a “full review” of the deal.“Mr Trump, the president-elect, has made various statements that the nuclear deal does not satisfy him, that it was not a good deal or even that it was the worst deal ever,” said Rouhani.“These are mostly slogans, and I don’t think that when he enters the White House, something will happen. It is not a bilateral deal that he can decide he likes or doesn’t like,” the president added.The deal was signed between Iran, the US, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.EU and British officials have this week said they would not support any renegotiation of the deal, which places strict curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting of international sanctions."

They love him because he’s mean and liberal and does everything they demand: further the leftist agenda through the brutal use of humiliation to target any public figure (or their child) who might derail Leftist causes.And contrary to conventional wisdom, Letterman’s not edgy. In fact, he’s just the opposite. Doing exactly what those who can criticize you want you to do is not edgy. Kissing the big Manhattan/Los Angeles bi-coastal ass of the elite is not edgy. He’s their jester; their puppet; their bitch. Worse, he’s about as funny as watching your old, half-deaf Uncle intimidate, humiliate and demean your Aunt and then smile at the rest of the family as though he’s just reaffirmed his manhood. Letterman reminds me of the Jason Robards character in “Parenthood” in more ways than you can imagine. In other words, he’s a jerk, but in a sad end-of-his-life kind of way.Oh, and how the elite critics resented nice ole’ Jay Leno for cleaning Letterman’s ratings’ clock all those years. And now that Jay’s back eating up primetime, they couldn’t wait to jump all over him with sniffing disapproval fed through a filter of wrist-flicking dismissal.After exactly one showthe knives came out:L.A. Times:“Sixteen minutes into the new ‘The Jay Leno Show’ it was difficult not to panic. This is the future of television? This wasn’t even a good rendition of television past.”New York Times:“So much ink has been devoted to describing how Mr. Leno’s new show would depart from his old one that it was startling to see how little difference there was.”NPR:[N]o one expected Leno to reinvent the wheel. It’s just that after so many years on the job, you’d expect he’d make a better one.(For those of you unfamiliar with these organizations, the first two  once had a reputation for doggedly pursuing news stories and holding the powerful accountable. As far as what they do now, other than perfecting the art of thinning their publications to the edge of not disappearing, no one really knows … as far as NPR, they’ve always sucked.)Good heavens, the L.A. Times was ready to panic after only sixteen minutes. Panic! And did anyone’s irony-alert go off when NPR criticized someone else for not reinventing the wheel? I’m surprised their review wasn’t interrupted by a twenty-minute pledge drive promising a butt-ugly tote bag and a CD of “Neil Sedaka Goes Cajun” for Premium Members.Jay Leno scored18 million viewersyesterday. Letterman drawsaround 4 million on a good night. If you like your television personalities too cool for school that’s got to be troubling – if you prefer those with a hold on the popular culture five nights a week not parade around with a United States flag (unless it’s on fire), today you’ve got to be a little frustrated. First ACORN, now this... What’s happening to my Amerika?!?!Even worse, those five hours Jay’s eating up could’ve otherwise been used to trash Christians and Republicans on “Law & Order: God We Love Obama.”You have to wonder if it will ever happen… If the coastal critics and their ilk will ever figure out that todaytheyare the establishment … they are The Man … and that the only real accomplishment of the cruel little needy Letterman who bounces at the end of their string is tarnishing a long history of sell outs.You want to be edgy in the entertainment business today? Be polite and keep the politics as across the board as possible. Walk on stage with the “edgy” goal of wanting to entertain and take away from their daily frustrations as many people as possible.Jay Leno’s the new edgy, the new ballsy…And that lapel flag makes him a downright iconoclast.I didn’t see his show, but I’m pulling for him because all the right people are not."

Erdogan has long argued that high interest rates cause inflation, although higher rates typically shore up a currency and help combat inflation.“I call on foreign investors who invest in our country to trust Turkey’s power and potential,” Erdogan said during a speech he delivered at his party’s congress.“The fluctuations of the past few days most definitely do not reflect the fundamentals of Turkey’s economy, real dynamics, potential or its tomorrow,” he said.The Turkish leader also called on citizens to put any foreign currency or gold they kept at home into banks to help the economy.Erdogan has been reaching out to nations in a bid to patch troubled relations and to attract foreign investments. He continued the conciliatory rhetoric during Wednesday’s congress of his ruling Justice and Development Party.“We will continue to shape our relationships with every country from the United States to Russia, from the European Union to the Arab geography in line with Turkey’s interests and our people’s expectations,” Erdogan said. “As a country located in the heart of Africa, Asia and Europe, we do not have the luxury to turn our backs on neither the east nor the west.”Despite currency difficulties since mid-2018, Turkey was one of the few countries to post economic growth during 2020, thanks to government stimulus, tax breaks and cheap credit from state-owned banks."
2092112251,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DAB46DK02,Cubans aghast at car prices as new law kicks in,"(AP) Cubans aghast at car prices as new law kicks inBy ANNE-MARIE GARCIAAssociated PressHAVANATalk about sticker shock!Cubans are eagerly flocking to Havana car dealerships as a new law takes effect eliminating a special permit requirement that has greatly restricted vehicle ownership in the country. To their dismay on Friday, the first day the law was in force, they found sharply hiked prices, some of them light years beyond all but the most well-heeled islanders.A new Kia Rio hatchback that starts at $13,600 in the United States sells for $42,000 here, while a fresh-off-the-lot Peugeot 508 family car, the most luxurious of which lists for the equivalent of about $53,000 in the U.K., will set you back a cool $262,000.“Between all my family here in Cuba and over in Miami, we couldn’t come up with that kind of money,” said Gilbert Losada, a 28-year-old musical director. “We’re going to wait and see if they lower the prices, which are really crazy. We’re really disappointed.”Cuba’s Communist-run government traditionally has placed huge markups on retail goods and services paid for with hard currency, a policy that amounts to a tax on people who can afford such goods. The practice applies to everything from dried pasta, to household appliances, to Internet access.The astronomical sticker prices on the cars will likely mean fewer sales and the state leaving money on the table, noted Philip Peters, a longtime Cuba analyst and president of the Virginia-based Cuba Research Center.“There’s a lot more money to be made at lower price points,” Peters said. “It’s a short-sighted tax-man’s mentality. … Paradoxically, they mark it up so much that they’re not going to make any money. But that’s the mentality.”Havana legalized the sale of used cars by private individuals in 2011. But longstanding rules remained in place requiring Cubans to obtain a Transportation Ministry permit to purchase a new or used car from state-run dealerships. Permission took months or years to obtain, resulting in a black market in which car buyers would often quickly flip them for a big profit.The new law eliminates the need for a permit, but does not allow Cubans to import automobiles directly. The government retains its monopoly on that, and alone decides a vehicle’s market value. Some exceptions will still exist allowing diplomatic missions and foreign entities to import vehicles.The Ferrari-like price schedules for even mundane new cars are a signal that automotive scarcity and high demand will likely continue to reign in Cuba, which is famous for the 1950s American cars that still rumble through the streets long after they became museum pieces elsewhere.Because replacing a car is so difficult, those lucky enough to own a finned Detroit classic or a boxy Russian import go to great lengths to keep them on the road as long as possible, swapping in makeshift parts and resorting to creative soldering.At a used car dealership in western Havana on Friday, there were a few relatively affordable options.A 1997 BMW was the cheapest vehicle and the first to sell shortly after the dealership opened at 8 a.m. It went for $14,457 to a young man who declined to talk to reporters, so it wasn’t known many miles it had previously logged.But even many of the used cars had eye-popping asking prices, such as a 2009 Hyundai minivan that listed for $110,000.“Let’s see if a revolutionary worker who lives honorably on his salary can come and buy a car at these prices,” said Guillermo Flores, a 27-year-old computer engineer. “This is a joke on the people.”In the past, permit holders typically bought used vehicles, often former rentals with high odometer readings that went for around $5,000-$8,000. New imports generally sold at about a 100 percent markup before. There was no explanation for the sudden, across-the-board spike in prices.Most Cubans still earn government salaries that average around $20 a month, though some make significantly more as musicians, artists, employees of foreign companies and diplomats and doctors sent on foreign missions. Many others get financial support from relatives overseas.But some who had managed to scrape together some savings said they’re now priced out of the market.“With these prices … those who will be able to buy are the privileged, or the bandits,” said Alfredo Boue, a 25-year-old cook. “I think the bandits are not the ones (stealing) in the streets, but the people who set these prices.”People were aghast and angry as they perused a list of prices posted outside the dealership. Some said it felt like something out of science fiction. One woman asked sarcastically if there were any bicycles, because surely that would be the only thing she could afford.Priority was given to people who had obtained a permit under the old system, but Antonio Diaz, a 66-year-old retiree who came expecting to pay $5,000, left empty-handed and disgusted.“What am I going to do with this letter?” he said, brandishing his now-useless permit. “I can’t buy anything. I don’t have the money. That was supposed to be the car for my old age, which I was going to buy after a lifetime of work.”“I’ll have to resign myself to living without a car,” Diaz said, shaking his head.___Associated Press writer Peter Orsi in Havana contributed."

YouTube, which is owned by Google, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Infowars said Tuesday it had multiple videos removed from YouTube, including one in which host Owen Shroyer alleged that Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg “can’t remember his lines” during a TV interview following the Feb. 14 shooting that left 17 dead. Among other videos it said were removed was one titled, “The Truth About Crisis Actors In The Florida Shooting.”The site said it also received a strike, or warning, for harassment and bullying. It said a second strike that was assessed early Tuesday was removed hours later. According to YouTube policy, two strikes results in the creator being unable to upload videos for two weeks. Infowars continuously uploaded videos to its “Alex Jones Channel” Tuesday.“There’s a major purge going on,” Alex Jones, the well-known right-wing conspiracy theorist and radio show host who owns the site, said in an interview. He has called the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School a hoax. “If you want to live in communist China, we’re almost there.”YouTube has had trouble flagging inappropriate content and keeping the site a place where advertisers feel comfortable spending money. Earlier this month, it suspended all ads from videos of one of its biggest stars, Logan Paul, after he posted video showing a suicide victim in Japan and a later one in which he used a Taser on a dead rat. YouTube also updated its policies to toughen steps it would take against creators who violate its policies.Separately, online recommendation platform Taboola said Tuesday it had disabled use of its technology to serve ads to Infowars via a third party distributor. Use of its technology to serve ads to Infowars was an “oversight” that was corrected “within hours” of being notified by a reporter for the ad-industry trade publication Digiday earlier this month, Taboola CEO Adam Singolda said by email.Use of its technology on Infowars violated Taboola’s acceptable use policy, which prohibits publishers from posting content that is “offensive,” ”abusive,” or “vulgar,” he said."

1000563971,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA3GDF080,Tampa Bay ends tough season on high note,"(AP) Tampa Bay ends tough season on high noteBy GEORGE HENRYAssociated PressATLANTACompared to the last five miserable weeks, Tampa Bay rookie running back Doug Martin sensed something different this time.Martin got all the proof he needed when the Buccaneers, though out of the playoffs for the fifth straight year, needed just 2 minutes to respond to a fourth-quarter touchdown by Atlanta.“I could see it in everybody’s eyes out there,” Martin said. “They weren’t going to let that happen. Everybody just started to show up.”Martin rushed for 142 yards, Josh Freeman and Mike Williams connected on a short touchdown pass and Tampa Bay snapped a five-game losing streak to end the season with a 22-17 victory Sunday.Despite falling short of their postseason goals again, the Bucs at least were able to leave the Georgia Dome feeling some self-respect.That was hardly the case last season, when they suffered a 10th straight loss in a Falcons rout and learned the next day that Raheem Morris had been fired as head coach.Atlanta, just like this year, was on its way to the playoffs.“We were on a losing streak last year, obviously, and it did not feel good walking out of this locker room, regardless of the situation,” safety Ronde Barber said. “I think everybody doesn’t feel great about the season, of course, but we’ll definitely be proud of the way we played this last game.”Tampa Bay (7-9) relieved some frustration against an NFC South rival that had ended its four-game winning on Nov. 25.The Bucs had not won since, but on Sunday they answered appropriately each time the Falcons (13-3) threatened to take the lead.Martin’s 40-yard touchdown late in the third quarter was significant because Atlanta had cut the lead to six after Asante Samuel picked off Freeman and Michael Turner scored on a 17-yard run.“Erik Lorig, our fullback, did a good job of staying on his guy, and also Donald Penn, our left tackle, stayed on his guy,” Martin said. “I just pressed it and bounced it out and then broke two tackles, and it was off to the races.”The score was important, too, because it helped restore Freeman’s confidence. The fourth-year quarterback had thrown four interceptions in each of the last two weeks as New Orleans and St. Louis outscored the Bucs by a combined 69-13.That wasn’t the case this time.“Any time you have a turnover, you have to respond,” Freeman said. “It’s happened a number of times this year. A lot of times we responded. Sometimes we didn’t respond, but especially when you’re on the road and the team is as good as the Falcons are or really any team, it’s crucial to respond.”Tampa Bay’s defense began the game ranked first against the run and last against the pass, but the Bucs were stout in both facets.They played lots of zone coverage and let their linemen and occasional blitz packages keep pressure on Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan.The Falcons’ 275 total offensive yards were their second-fewest this season as defensive ends Daniel Te’o-Nesheim and Michael Bennett combined with defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and linebacker Lavonte David with two sacks for minus-25 yards and six quarterback hits.Middle linebacker Mason Foster finished with 12 tackles, 11 of them solo stops, and safety Mark Barron made arguably the Bucs’ defensive play of the game when he knocked down a fourth-down pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez with 2:02 remaining.“The few pressures we did bring really were run stoppers,” Barber said. “We did a good job of first and second down to what we thought were manageable third downs to get off the field. It’s been a problem for us all year, but it’s how you win football games in this league.”Offensively, Freeman surpassed 4,000 yards passing for the first time in his career. Martin, who began the game ranked third in NFL yards from scrimmage, averaged 5.1 yards on 28 attempts, and Williams beat Samuel in the back of the end zone for an 8-yard score that gave Tampa Bay a seven-point lead midway through the second quarter.Dekoda Watson sparked the special teams by blocking a second-quarter punt that led to the second of Connor Barth’s three field goals.The Bucs played their best against Atlanta’s starters for four quarters. Despite having the NFC’s No. 1 seed and homefield advantage in the playoffs clinched last week, Falcons coach Mike Smith kept his first-string players on the field for the entire game.“This team, I think, never really takes it for granted that they get to do this (for a living),” first-year Tampa Bay coach Greg Schiano said. “It’s a good thing to be able to use all of your cumulative experiences and make up who you are and what you do.”Freeman said he would take some satisfaction in the victory even though it came too late to save the season.“If you end the year without winning the Super Bowl, your season can’t be considered a success,” Freeman said. “But certainly I’m optimistic. We’ve got a lot of pieces and a number of guys we’ll get back on the team this offseason. Looking forward, I’m really excited.”NOTES: Martin was the only Tampa Bay running back with a carry. WR Tiquan Underwood and Freeman each had one carry for 1 yard. … Bryant’s first-quarter field goal was his 33rd of the season, setting a Falcons record. Jay Feely had 32 field goals in 2002. … Tony Gonzalez reached 90 catches to become the first NFL tight end with five seasons of 90 or more receptions. … Ryan’s TD pass gave him a team-record 32 for the season. Steve Bartkowski threw 31 TD passes in 1980. … Jacquizz Rodgers had a game-high eight catches for 50 yards and led Atlanta with 28 yards rushing on five carries.___Follow George Henry at http://www.twitter.com/georgehenryAP___Online: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"

We insisted Chris talk his friend into joining us, and we’re  so glad that he did!When  I approached Joe about spotlighting him, I learned that he had  donated his great song, “Just In Case,” toSoldiers’ Angels, a nonprofit organization that provides aid and comfort to our military members and their families, for theirPocket Angelinitiative.   How very cool.[youtube HGaR_8mrHVc nolink]Soldiers’ Angels wrote the following about Joe:Boston singer-songwriter, Joe Merrick is a civilian, yet perfectly captures the thoughts and feelings of many a soldier nearing the end of a wartime deployment in his heart-rendering song,Just In Case.   Joe generously donated use of the song at the very beginning of the Borders Bookstores’Pocket Angelscampaign.Joe’s style is generally country-rock, with a strong nod to the original rock and roll sound.   Besides singing and writing, he is also an instrumentalist and producer, and as the owner of Guilty Dog Studios he has played with and recorded with such internationally-known artists as Kevin Barry (guitarist for Paula Cole and Mary Chapin- Carpenter), Keith Harris (Drummer for Black Eyed Peas), Dan Kenny (Keyboardist for Britney Spears), and a variety of Boston-area musicians.   He has received songwriting awards from ABET, The Great American Song Contest, Song of the Year, and Billboard.   He is currently working on his fourth CD and a DVD documentary, and recently signed a deal with Pen Publishing.Joe had this to say about his song:No matter what your feelings are on the wars, our military should be thanked, respected, and treated like ROYALTY when they come home.   I thanked a Marine I met at Starbucks today.   When I play the song live at bars I dedicate it to the veterans and the ones serving now and I say to the patrons ‘you can now sit down and have a beer in peace because of these men and women, so take a listen…this song is for them.’[youtube 74rGr2eLKm8 nolink]When I saw Joe’s video profile I was even more blown away by his talent.   Not only is he an amazing singer, songwriter, vocalist, and instrumentalist, but he is a highly sought-after music production professional.   I asked him  how the downturn in our economy has impacted his business as owner of Guilty Dog Studios, to which he replied:Guilty Dog Studios has luckily remained strong. I have a close knit family of repeat clients all from word of mouth. My philosophy is to do the best I can for everyone that comes through these doors. Each client reflects my passion for quality art. I love being an American and treasure my freedom to be an independent music producer. The troops provide me this privilege and I am indebted to them. We need to protect our founding fathers’ vision.   I feel BigDawg [Music Mafia] is helping to preserve FREEDOM.For you musicians out there, we are not solely about  showcasing artists with conservative, political songs; we are about promoting artists who just happen to love America and the liberties that come with being an American.   Many of the musicians at our site have non-political songs that are  fantastic and are far superior to much of what we hear played on mainstream radio stations these days.   Joe’s  intensely passionateApolcalypseis a perfect example.[youtube s3SoSxNQStY nolink]Thankfully, “Al Gore’s Amazing Internet” has given Joe and all the other amazingly talented artists at our site (especially those who are writing/recording songs with positive messages and a healthy dose of truth) the ability to share our craft via conservative sites like Big Hollywood and Internet radio shows.   In fact, we’ve recently partnered withLiberty Bell Radio, and on 5 November, 10AM ET, hostsMatthew&Reesewill debut the all-newBigDawg’s Music Hourradio show.   Each week they will showcase  five songs in the first half hour with the story behind each song and in the second hour you will get to know  a featured guest artist from our site.      We will also be partnering withFrom the Right  Radioin the near future to bring a solid  hour of great music every week from some great patriots (hosted by yours truly).   Check our site regularly for more details.One thing is certain – you will be hearing plenty of Joe’s great music on both shows.    In a review written about  Joe’sLost in BostonCD release party (which includesJust In CaseandApolcalypse),  writer Tricia Nesti said the following:I’ve heard several of his albums and this is my favorite. While starting out intending to make a country album that ended up much more like a rock album, Joe did something wonderful; he took rock and roll back to its roots. Rock evolved from Jazz and Country music (after all, Elvis and the Beatles took much of their inspiration from artists like James Brown and Chuck Berry, they were some of the artists who really started the movement called rock music), and Joe’s album takes you back to that original rock and roll sound. And it’s not just great to listen to; it’s refreshing.   Especially in a world where rock music is sounding significantly less and less like rock music everyday (since when is Kelly Clarkson rock music, Kiss 108?).Like what you’ve heard so far?    Want to hear more?   Be sure to  “Like”  Joe Merrick’sFaceBook fan pageand subscribe to hisYouTube channel.   And if you are a musician and need a real pro to work with on your next project,Joe Merrickis  your man.   Here is what one satisfied customer had to say:“… of studios there are really only three that matter…Abbey Road in London, Sun Studios in Memphis and Guilty Dog in Hanson.   Thanks for building a place for us to hide out and indulge our guilty pleasures”– Bob Phillips"

It will, however, continue to air everywhere else. According to KDKA 2 CBS Pittsburgh, Casey hassaidthat the parallel between the ad and Barletta’s family tragedy was unintentional."

9173301585,https://www.breitbart.com/news/ap-source-browns-watson-to-meet-with-nfl-officials-in-texas/,AP source: Browns QB Watson to meet with NFL reps in Texas,"A person familiar with the situation tells The Associated Press that Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson will meet with NFL officials in TexasAP source: Browns QB Watson to meet with NFL reps in TexasBy TOM WITHERSAP Sports WriterThe Associated PressCLEVELANDCLEVELAND (AP) — NFL officials will meet this week with Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson as the league continues to investigate whether he violated its personal conduct policy, a person familiar with the plans told The Associated Press on Monday.Watson, who is facing 22 civil lawsuits from massage therapists accusing him of sexual misconduct, is scheduled to speak with the league’s representatives in Texas, said the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Watson is facingpotential disciplineby the league, which is independently investigating his actions while he was with the Houston Texans. Commissioner Roger Goodell said as recently as April 28 at the NFL draft that there was no timeframe on any possible ruling on Watson.Reporter Josina Anderson was first to report the planned meeting on Twitter.“We have no update and will decline comment on that tweet,” league spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email to the AP. “There’s no timetable as the review is active and ongoing.”Watson’s attorney, Rusty Hardin, told the AP he will leave it to the NFL to discuss its schedule of interviews, but he assumes that “Watson will be interviewed at great length soon.”The meeting with league officials is a significant development for Watson, who signed a fully guaranteed $230 million contract in March with the Browns after initially turning down a trade to Cleveland.The Browns, who sent three first-round draft picks and six total selections to the Texans for Watson, are eager to find out if they’ll be without him for any portion of this season after making such a major investment in the three-time Pro Bowler.In March, two Texas grand juries declined to indict Watson on criminal complaints from 10 women. He has denied all wrongdoing and said during a news conference with the Browns in April that he “never assaulted or disrespected or harassed any woman in my life.”Watson has given depositions in several of the civil cases. To this point, he has not missed any of Cleveland’s offseason programs.It’s not clear with whom Watson will be meeting this week.Lisa Friel, a former prosecutor in New York, has been heading the investigation. Once it is completed, former U.S. District Court Judge Sue Robinson, a disciplinary officer jointly appointed by the league and NFL Players Association, will decide if Watson violated the conduct policy and will report to Goodell.There is some precedent in this type of case. Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was suspended six games by the league in 2010 after a 20-year-old college student accused him of sexually assaulting her. The punishment was later reduced to four games.As his future with the Browns remains uncertain, Watson is treating some of his new teammates to a weekend in the Bahamas to do some bonding and field work. It’s not known which players will be making the trip with Watson.Last month, cornerback Denzel Ward said Watson and All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett were planning trips for the Browns’ offense and defense.___Associated Press writer Juan Lozano in Houston contributed to this report.___More AP NFL:https://apnews.com/hub/nflandhttps://apnews.com/hub/pro-32andhttps://twitter.com/AP_NFL"

In an era of hopelessness and resignation, this film is a reminder that another world order is still possible.Breitbart News contacted the filmmaker’s PR company to ask if the film touched on issues such as the rapes at Occupy, the Black Bloc or the immense amount of money the Occupy movement went through; nearly a million dollars in just a few months. The film’s rep indicated no final decisions had been made because the film is still being edited.If thefilm’s official Twitterfeed is any indication, the makers of the film seem to be right in line with many of Occupy’s top issues. It’s all standard left media tweets; Walmart is a common target, as are the Tea Party, conservatives and guns:You get the idea. The film’s official Twitter feed isn’t neutral or balanced, but there isn’t anything wrong with that.Documentaries aren’t news; the best documentaries have a strong voice and don’t try to present every possible side of an issue in under two hours. “Occupy Unmasked” certainly takes a bold position on the Occupy movement and served as a counter-narrative to what the mainstream media was telling the public. In spirit of Andrew Breitbart’s belief in “more voices, not less,” there isn’t anything wrong with a pro-Occupy film.The problem comes when the media doesn’t admit to its own biases. It will be interesting to see if the filmmakers behind “99%” are able to do that, or if they will portray themselves as unbiased and objective. The filmmakers certainly seem to share the underlying premises and general leftist outlook of the movement. Will they admit this? Time will tell."

The statement follows the discovery of bomb precursor ingredients in the home Mohamed Hichem M. shared with his family, and internet history of searches related to bomb-making and Islamic Jihad.French police speak of some “inconsistencies” in the case, including the high level of sophistication with the creation of the bomb detonator — on which Mohamed Hichem M’s DNA was found — contrasted with the fact a very low explosive charge was used. This means that despite being packed with bolts and screws, the bomb that was delivered in a paper bag did not kill any bystanders when it exploded in a Lyon bakery, even though it blew out windows in the near vicinity.Police reports have also said the suspect did not have any previous suspicion of radicalisation, did not on first appearance fit the Islamic terror profile, and his precise motivation remains unclear. France24statesthe suspect ordered explosive ingredients, ball bearings, and electrical components in March and April.Despite having told investigators that he was a “lone wolf” with no help in launching the attack, French BFMTV has now reported Mohamed Hichem M. has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. France has sustained a series of Islamic State planned or inspired attacks in recent years, the most recent being the Strasbourg Christmas Market shooting in 2018.Jihadist Cherif Chekatt, who supported the Islamic State,opened fireon a Christmas market in Strasbourg killing three and injuring a dozen others before beinggunned downby police himself. The most deadly terror attack on French soil in recent memory was the Bataclan massacre in 2015, where a coordinated strike by a Jihadist cell attacked a music venue, systematically executing concert goers in the panic to escape gunfire.Some 130 were killed, and the French state hasrecognised and compensateda further 2,625 victims. More than 250 people have beenkilledin Islamist terror attacks in France since 2015."

These videos were made to satisfy sexual fetishes and included cutting off the limbs of a puppy and kitten and urinating on them in what was intended to be a sexually charged atmosphere.According to the indictment dated April 29, 2013, 54-year-old Brent Justice, tortured a dog in a video entitled “Puppy I and II” by cutting the dog’s neck with a knife.Prosecutors also filed a notice with the court saying that Justice was involved in the promotion, organization, filming, marketing, and/or profitability of over twenty films.Convicted animal crush video makers Ashley Nicole Richards and Brent Justice. (Houston Police Department Mugshots)The notice to use this evidence contains graphic and horrific acts performed by Justice and his 25-year-old accomplice, Ashley Richards. Both were arrested in August of 2012. The videos were made in Houston during 2010 to 2012.To describe just one of these videos, Richards squeezed and shook a cat’s neck, then tapes him to a piece of cardboard and whips him with a rope. She pushed the heel of her high-heel shoe into the cat’s mouth and then struck the cat multiple times with a meat cleaver.During the video Richards asks the cat if it has had enough, puts the blade of a knife in the cat’s anus numerous times, chops the cat’s arm off, rips the skin of the cat exposing the cat’s organs, and uses a meat cleaver to chop and saw the cat’s neck until it is severed from its body.The woman says during the video, “Now that’s how you f**k a pu**y real good.” Richards then urinates on the dead cat and says, “Kiss my a**. Kiss it bit*h. Kiss it.” A male voice is heard in the background and male African-American legs are also seen during the film.The other descriptions in the prosecutor’s notice of evidence filed with the criminal court are just as graphic. In one of the videos, Richards punctures a cat’s eye with the heel of her shoe.The victims in these videos included cats, dogs, puppies, mice, a rooster, a pigeon, birds, and fish. In one of the videos, Richards skinned a rabbit alive and then cut off its head.Richards would wear sexually-arousing clothing and sometimes she would wear a mask.At the time her cases were pending in state court, Richards had pending cases in Waco, Texas, for assault of a police officer, and resisting arrest, search or transport. A report for criminal trespass and theft by check was filed but no charges were filed.Animal crush videos are generally obtained online and some are sold as sacrifices or rituals.Groupsthat work to bring awareness to, and put a stop to these videos, note that there is a link between animal abuse and serial killers.Justice was convicted and sentenced in a Harris County (Houston) criminal district court this week for the crime of cruelty to livestock animals. The offense is a felony.Justice’s partner in the video project, Ashley Nicole Richards, pleaded guilty in federal court for her role in the videos in September, asreportedby Breitbart Texas’ Ildefonso Ortiz.Richards was convicted in state criminal district court in May 2014 and was sentenced to ten years of prison. Like Justice, state prosecutors also filed a notice of intention to use evidence against Richards that detained the heinous acts she committed on animals.TheHouston Chroniclereportedthat Richards was one of the first persons in the nation to be convicted in federal court under the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010. A federal judge had dismissed five counts of video creation and distribution against the pair in 2013 saying the films were protected speech. The Fifth Circuit reinstated the charges ruling that there are limits on speech.Justice has an extensive criminal history dating back to 1979. He was convicted of the felony offense of aggravated assault on a peace officer on July 14, 1984, in Harris County. Other convictions include theft, three convictions for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (2004, 1984, and 1979), disorderly conduct/family assault, and another aggravated assault of a peace officer charge in 1980.The couple were arrested after a complaint was filed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

As bullets flew past he saw a bus full of hostages — some wearing JGC uniforms — drive past.He watched with horror as the vehicle came under attack, but said he had no idea of the fate of those on board.After nightfall, when the shooting had stopped he began trudging through the desert, walking for an hour before he came across Algerian soldiers and safety.Japan’s Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported it had spoken to an Algerian man who was taken hostage with about 20 foreign nationals, including six Japanese.He said the foreigners were forced to link arms and then had their wrists and ankles bound with plastic ties, effectively forming a human chain.The militants then wrapped explosives around their captives’ bodies.He said hostages were allowed to use the lavatory and were offered food, but none of the Japanese accepted because they were too scared.The 45-year-old said he had made his escape on Thursday when the Algerian military staged its first assault.He said he and other Algerians had run in the confusion, but the foreigners could not get away.“I don’t know what happened to them afterwards. I hope they survived,” he was quoted by the Mainichi as saying.JGC, which has 78 employees in Algeria, said Monday morning 17 of its employees who were at the plant are still unaccounted for — 10 Japanese and seven others.Witnesses have said nine Japanese people were killed in the 72-hour ordeal.JGC spokesman Takeshi Endo told reporters in Japan that employees who were in the plant at the time of the siege but managed to escape before being taken hostage would help to identify anyone in the hospital.“We were cautious about asking them to do this tough job, but they agreed to do it and as they were working closely with the colleagues who are still missing, it will surely be helpful,” Endo said."
6141887505,http://www.breitbart.com/news/apnewsbreak-walruses-in-alaska-may-have-died-in-stampede/,APNewsBreak: Walruses in Alaska may have died in stampede,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Thousands of Pacific walrus are coming to Alaska’s northwest shore again in the absence of summer sea ice and not all are surviving.A survey Monday of a mile of coastline near the Inupiaq Eskimo village of Point Lay found 64 dead walruses, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told The Associated Press.Most of the animals were younger than a year old. The cause of death is not known, said agency spokeswoman Andrea Medeiros, but stampedes — set off when startled walruses rush to the sea, crushing smaller animals — are a likely suspect.“Our thinking is, because of the age of the animals — they were young animals — it’s likely that it was caused by a stampede, probably more likely than disease, given the age class,” Medeiros said.A polar bear, hunter, airplane or boat can cause a stampede. Alaska Native residents of Point Lay, who may legally hunt walrus for food, expressed concern after seeing an airplane flying near the herd and possibly circling.“That certainly is a concern,” Medeiros said. “That’s not what we want people to be doing.”Fish and Wildlife Service guidelines instruct pilots of single-engine planes to stay at least a half-mile away from walruses on land or ice, and if closer, to fly above 2,000 feet (610 meters).The guidelines call for helicopters and multi-engine aircraft to stay a mile away, or if closer, above 3,000 feet (915 meters). The agency warns that it is only guidance but creating a disturbance is a violation of federal law.Several hundred walruses came ashore near Point Lay on Aug. 3, the earliest recorded appearance of a herd in a phenomenon tied to climate warming and diminished Arctic Ocean sea ice.A week later, the number had grown to 2,000. In the past month, 30,000 to 40,000 walruses at times have crowded the beach, Medeiros said.Walrus dive hundreds of feet to eat clams on the ocean bottom, but unlike seals, they cannot swim indefinitely. Historically, sea ice has provided a platform for rest and safety far from predators for mothers and calves north of the Bering Strait.However, sea ice has receded much farther north in recent years because of global warming, beyond the shallow continental shelf, over water more than 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) deep. That’s far too deep for walruses to reach the ocean bottom.Instead of staying on sea ice over the deep water, walruses have gathered on shore to rest.Calves born earlier this year are especially vulnerable when shoulder to shoulder with mature females that weigh more than a ton.Residents of Point Lay reported three to five dead walruses in early August. A community member who works with the Fish and Wildlife Service counted 64 dead walruses Monday and tagged them so they would not be counted in a later survey.The agency hopes to send a veterinarian to determine the cause of the deaths. No one has witnessed a stampede.“Depending on when the last time he did his survey, it may be an accumulation over several weeks,” Medeiros said.Shaye Wolf, climate science director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who wrote the 2008 petition to list walruses as threatened or endangered species, said the Fish and Wildlife Service should review guidelines for protecting walruses.“These animals are suffering a great deal of stress from climate change, and when they’re pushed ashore, they should get very strong protections from disturbances,” she said.The ultimate threat to walruses is the rapid loss of sea ice due to climate disruption, she said, adding that rollbacks of climate change protections by the Trump administration will further endanger the animals.Ice in the Chukchi Sea has not reached its minimum for 2017. Walruses likely will keep coming ashore until ice starts to re-form with the onset of winter, Fish and Wildlife said."

7050617507,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/10/17/dan-brown-declares-that-god-cannot-survive-science/,Dan Brown Declares That ‘God Cannot Survive Science’,"Dan Brown, author of the best-sellingDa Vinci Code,has joined philologist Friedrich Nietzsche in announcing the death of God, declaring that “God cannot survive science.”“Historically, no god has survived science. Gods evolved,” the American writer said last week at the Frankfurt Book Fair, where helaunchedthe German edition of his latest novel,Origin. “All the gods of our past have fallen. So the question now is: Are we naive to think the gods of today won’t suffer the same fate?”“Our need for the exterior God that sits up there and judges us… will diminish and eventually disappear,” Brown said.Along with several other modern God-slayers, such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, Brown paints an absolute opposition between God and science, such that only one of the two can survive. Thus, as science advances, it will necessarily take the place of God—a thesis that not all accept.“It is an extremelysimplisticview of history to say that science kills religion,” said astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Luminet, research director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), who self-identifies as an atheist materialist.According to Luminet, the notion of faith in a revealed truth or a personal God escapes the laws of the scientist busy decoding the universe. “From this point of view, each one refers to his own spiritual experience: for some, more science leads to God while others move away from it.”Brown’s belief in the innate antagonism between religion and science bears out recent studies showing that nonbelievers tend to see the two fields to be irreconcilable.A 2015studyby the Pew Center found that atheists are far more likely to see a conflict between faith and science than religious believers. While people of faith often see no conflict between science and religion, irreligious people often imagine that the two are completely incompatible.The Pew report revealed that 73 percent of those who seldom or never attend religious services say that science and religion are often in conflict, while those who attend services at least once a week are 23 percent less likely to say so.Among the unaffiliated—a group that includes atheists, agnostics, and those who belong to no religion in particular—the numbers are even higher. More than three quarters (76 percent) of the unaffiliated say that science and religion are “often in conflict.”For many religious believers, however, the two fields are mutually supportive.“It is absurd that one can still think of the relationship between science and faith in terms of opposition after more than a century of fruitful dialogue,” said Father Thierry Magnin, priest, physicist and rector of the Catholic University of Lyon. “God is not destined to fill the gaping holes left by science. As for the latter, scientists know well that it does not say everything.”Brown’s knowledge of the Christian faith seems somewhat rudimentary, evidenced by his recentstatementthat “Christianity, Judaism and Islam share a gospel, and it’s the one I grew up with,” but this hasn’t curbed his enthusiasm for scandalizing believers.In this fifth installment of the saga begun with theDa Vinci Code,Harvard professor Robert Langdon endeavors to decipher the mysteries of the origin of the world, exploring in particular the struggle between science and religion.A former student of Langdon’s, Edmond Kirsch, has been assassinated just as he is about to reveal a scientific breakthrough that he says will bring about the downfall of Western religion and revolutionize how people think of life and death.Brown’s claims that no religion has ever survived science have little backing in the historical record, since the modern natural sciences grew out of Judeo-Christian culture. As sociologist Rodney Stark has so convincinglyshown, science was “still-born” in the great civilizations of the ancient world, and only came to fruition in Christian civilization.Why is it, Stark ponders, that empirical science and the scientific method did not develop in China (with its sophisticated society), in India (with its philosophical schools), in Arabia (with its advanced mathematics), in Japan (with its dedicated craftsmen and technologies), or even in ancient Greece or Rome?Science flourished in societies where a Judeo-Christian mindset understood nature to be ordered and intelligible, the work of an intelligent Creator, Stark concludes. Science grew and thrived where people assumed that the natural world makes sense and thus can be studied and understood. Far from being an obstacle to science, Christian soil provided the fertile humus where modern science could take root.Unsurprisingly, some of history’s greatest scientists—Newton, Pasteur, Galilei, Lavoisier, Kepler, Copernicus, Faraday, Maxwell, Bernard, and Heisenberg—were Christians who found that faith was an asset, rather than an obstacle, to science.Three years ago, Pope Francis asserted his conviction that science and faith are not only compatible, they need one another.The Big Bang “doesn’t contradict the intervention of a divine Creator, but demands it,” the Popesaid, because the origin of the world “is not the work of chaos.”Addressing the plenary assembly of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Francis said that God is not some sort of wizard, but rather “the Creator who brought all things into being.” The origin of the world derives directly “from a supreme Principle of creative love,” he added.“Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve,” he said.Follow Thomas D.

Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and James Clyburn (D-S.C.) are vying for whip, and Larson’s plan would preclude either Hoyer or Clyburn from challenging the Connecticut Democrat for caucus chairman if they lost the whip’s race – a scenario that many Democrats, but certainly not Larson, had hoped for.Larson announced the schedule without consulting other members of the leadership team, aides said, including Hoyer and Clyburn. The move set off a series of recriminations among Democratic leadership offices, and at least one office complained directly to Larson.“It’s an incumbent-protection move by Larson,” a leadership aide said. “There should have been negotiations.”Under Larson’s plan, lawmakers will first vote for the caucus chairman, then minority leader, caucus vice chairman and finally minority whip. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has yet to be challenged for minority leader, and neither has Larson nor Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), who is running to keep his job as vice chairman.Larson’s office said the order of elections was set based on precedent, with the contested election coming at the end. The caucus chairman would be elected first, an aide said, so he could then preside over the remaining contests. “This is based on how it has been done in the past,” the Larson aide said. “We wanted to make it as equal as possible” for the other candidates.Other leadership offices, however, mocked that explanation. “There is no precedent,” a senior Democratic leadership aide said. “The real way it’s done is everyone talks and decides together the order. It’s negotiated each time, so the idea of precedent is simply not true.”The Democratic leaders declined to comment on the record, not wanting to escalate tensions in an already fraught leadership battle.Read the whole thinghere.All that talk in the media about a “GOP Civil War” is simply to obscure the fact that the House Democrats are about to tear themselves apart.

5011464669,http://www.breitbart.com/news/historic-bathhouse-offers-respite-from-gazas-hardships/,Historic bathhouse offers respite from Gaza’s hardships,"GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — After dawn prayers in Gaza, a few dozen men descend a metal staircase to gather in the steamy confines of Hamam al-Sumara, a centuries-old bathhouse where residents of the isolated territory find respite and relief.Stained glass windows in the central dome allow rays of light to pierce the clouds of steam. On the heated marble platforms below, men recline between visits to the steam room or massages.“I come to this bath for treatment of diseases such as muscle spasms or cramps, getting rid of inflammation,” said Shafiq Al-Aqqad. He also comes here to celebrate happy occasions, like weddings.Historic bathhouses like this one can be found across the Middle East, where they preserve a tradition of public bathing that goes back to ancient times. Hamam al-Sumara, Arabic for the Samaritans’ Bath, dates back 1,000 years but has been renovated, most recently in the 1990s by the Palestinian Authority.Gaza City used to boast a half dozen bathhouses, but most were dismantled to make room for the city’s rapid expansion in the last century, including after the 1948 war, when some 200,000 Palestinians came to Gaza after fleeing or being expelled from their homes in what is now Israel. Gaza had previously been home to just 60,000 people.In more recent times, the surviving bathhouse has actually benefited from the conflict. A blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007 has made it virtually impossible for most residents to leave the narrow coastal strip. Civil servants working for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority meanwhile still receive their salaries despite being ordered not to work with Hamas authorities. The result, bathhouse owners say, is that clients have more time on their hands and fewer ways to spend it.Visitors pay around $5 to enter the bathhouse, with separate times reserved for men and women. Wearing slippers and towels wrapped around their waists, the men begin with a bracing visit to the steam room, before dousing themselves with cold water. Attendants offer full body scrubs with exfoliating gloves, as well as massages and more specific treatments.“We deal with several cases of pain in the backbone or legs,” said Mohammed Masoud, a physical therapist, as he pressed on the shoulders of a client.The bathers can then soak in a warm pool beneath the dome before retiring to a lounge area for tea or coffee."

And I am not going to say that Sweden losing is a bad thing.”Meanwhile, after failing to make it to the 24-team Euro on French soil last year, the Netherlands are in a battle even to finish second and grab a place in the two-legged play-offs in November.Dick Advocaat’s side are fourth, three points behind second-placed Sweden with three qualifiers remaining, including a meeting with the Swedes in Amsterdam in October.France should top the section and Deschamps has enough quality at his disposal for his team to be genuine contenders to win the World Cup.At a packed Stade de France he left Mbappe on the bench at the start as the 18-year-old’s loan move from Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain was made official little over an hour prior to kick-off.New Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele had not even been named in the squad, while Bayern Munich’s Kingsley Coman won his first cap since the Euro 2016 final loss to Portugal at the same ground.France were outstanding, opening the scoring when Djibril Sidibe found Griezmann and the Atletico Madrid forward played a one-two with Olivier Giroud before running into the box and finishing through the legs of goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen.– Lukaku hat-trick –The Dutch were already struggling to stay in the game even before Strootman was dismissed just after the hour mark after picking up a second yellow card in a little over five minutes.Arjen Robben squandered their best chance to equalise before Monaco winger Lemar put France out of sight in the 72nd minute, sending a stunning left-foot volley into the top-right corner after the ball broke to him on the edge of the box.That was his first international goal, and he was provided with his second on a plate by Griezmann two minutes before the end.There was still time for substitute Mbappe to sweep in a fourth, and for Robben to hit the bar on a miserable night for the Netherlands.Currently serving a five-match ban in Spain with Real Madrid, Ronaldo showed no signs of ring-rustiness as he opened the scoring in Portugal’s 5-1 win over the Faroe Islands in Oporto with an acrobatic volley inside three minutes.He scored a penalty and went on to complete his hat-trick to make it 14 goals in this qualifying campaign and 78 international goals in 144 appearances for his country.The reigning European champions, for whom William Carvalho and Nelson Oliveira also scored, are still three points behind Group B leaders Switzerland, whose 3-0 defeat of Andorra maintained their perfect record.In Group H, PSG’s Thomas Meunier and Romelu Lukaku both scored hat-tricks in Belgium’s 9-0 drubbing of minnows Gibraltar that leaves them six points clear of Greece, held 0-0 by Estonia."

5690912830,http://www.breitbart.com/news/six-months-post-hurricane-hunger-gnaws-at-southern-haiti/,"Six months post-hurricane, hunger gnaws at southern Haiti","Jérémie (Haiti) (AFP) – Crouching beside the makeshift shelter shared with his parents and five siblings, Fanfan Edouard slowly sharpens his machete. But there’s no rush to cut firewood, because there is no food to cook.“I’ll try to buy rice on credit and find work, anything to pay later,” the 26-year-old says, speaking without much conviction.Since Hurricane Matthew destroyed their two small homes, the Edouard family makes ends meet in a shelter just a few square meters large.But corrugated tin roofs do little to protect the two beds they share. When it rains, the family spends their nights in a nearby cave.“We’re not comfortable because we have to pile up on each other, but it’s a chance for us to have a dry space,” says Edouard’s mother, Marguerite.Having just one cave for shelter is hardly the main concern of the approximately 100 people who live in Fond Rouge, on the outskirts of Jeremie in the southwest of Haiti.Matthew slammed the region around Jeremie in October 2016. The storm, which tore through the Caribbean, killed more than 700 people — mostly in Haiti — and caused some $2.8 billion in damage.Haiti is also still struggling to recover from the world’s most significant cholera outbreak, with an estimated 30,000 cases expected this year, as well as the effects of the January 2010 earthquake, with tens of thousands of people still camping in tents without proper sanitation.– ‘Used to misery’ –Isolated some two hours on foot from the nearest town, these small farming families that lost their crops received aid only once in the past six months. They survived on tea of wild herbs and bread – and endure plenty of hunger.“We’re Haitians, we’re used to misery,” says Joachim Agelot, a 22 year-old hurricane survivor. “I was in (school when the hurricane struck) and this is my life now: I can’t go to school anymore, and I lost two sisters in the hurricane.”In downtown Jeremie, where NGO aid groups regularly meet with United Nations officials, the living conditions of hurricane survivors is hardly any better.On Jeremie’s beach some 15 men work to raise a nearly empty net.“We all lost our boats so we can only fish here,” lamented Astrid Guerrier, 38. “There is nothing but small fish. We know that it’s dangerous because they do not have time to breed, so later there will be fewer fish.”“But we have no choice: we only have that to eat and to try to earn a little money.”With her feet in the sand, Wiliana Charles has managed to rake in just a dozen fish — mere centimeters long — and a few crabs.“Sometimes I lose money doing this, because at the market I cannot resell them at the price I paid the fisherman,” she said, adding that yesterday she failed to make even 25 Haitian gourdes, about 36 US cents.Earning less than half a dollar a day means she cannot feed her five children.“I always look for friends and neighbors who can give me a portion,” she said, her eyes fixed on the meager catch. “Really, I wonder if I have the right to live in this world.”– Waste of resources –In March, a branch of the minister of agriculture working on food security dubbed the circumstances in the southwest Grande Anse department — which took a direct hit from the storm — “chaotic,” saying that more than 180,000 people were in an “emergency situation.”Bertrand Dasney, who works in Jeremie for the ministry of agriculture, got the fishermen’s association to voluntarily clean up trash that has accumulated over past months on the beach.He is a witness to the daily challenge Haitians face to survive as well as what he sees as a waste of resources.“The money goes into the big cars that come and go, in the gas they consume,” he said. “Imagine, the other day, a foreign NGO took two cars, 10 people, just to put two boxes back in a remote area.”“They are not accountable to us, Haitians, but they will have to be accountable to God,” he said, earning approving looks from fishermen who have resumed cleaning, though without masks to protect themselves from toxic fumes.“Unfortunately, we don’t have the money to buy them,” sighed Dasney."

The court on Thursday raised the possibility of bringing criminal charges against the Catalan parliament’s speaker for allowing the vote.Catalonia’s regional president, Carles Puigdemont, said last Wednesday that he was open to negotiating the terms of a legally binding referendum but he would hold it with or without Spain´s blessing.Puigdemont comfortably won a parliamentary confidence vote last Thursday in a show of unity that he hoped would spur further support for his independence agenda, which aims to establish basic laws and a state structure by next September.Some 48 percent of Catalans supported secession in a poll in July, although that it is below its peak from a few years ago."
6184253071,http://www.breitbart.com/news/san-juan-mayor-in-hurricane-spotlight-after-trump-tweets/,San Juan mayor in hurricane spotlight after Trump tweets,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — In Puerto Rico’s hurricane-ravaged capital, Carmen Yulin Cruz is everywhere you go these days: handing out bags of ice, wading through chest-deep floodwaters, hugging people in need of comfort.Cruz has long won attention across the island for her hands-on style of leadership in San Juan. But this week she rose to international prominence as a target of Twitter attacks by U.S. President Donald Trump — including one tweet Sunday calling her and others “politically motivated ingrates.”The insult came hours after Saturday Night Live portrayed Cruz in a skit highlighting the latest controversy for the 54-year-old former human resources executive, who occupies one of Puerto Rico’s most powerful posts and has become something of a divisive figure on the island of 3.4 million residents.In a U.S. territory whose relationship with the mainland is usually the single most prominent political issue, Cruz backs independence but is a member of the party that supports maintaining the territorial status quo. A graduate of Boston University and Carnegie Mellon, she is also a former member of the island’s House of Representatives.She first grabbed headlines in 2012 when she ran against San Juan’s three-term incumbent mayor, cobbling together a campaign committee in just three days when her party’s original candidate dropped out. Despite being a virtual unknown for many, she cruised to a surprising win by securing the support of a coalition of left-leaning interests from the LGBTQ community to university students to financially powerful unions.“Imagine what I’ll do when I’m the mayor of San Juan,” she told reporters in August 2012, three months before the vote.Once in office Cruz launched a million-dollar urban renewal program, renovated public parks and plazas and unionized San Juan employees as promised during her campaign. She aligned herself with Puerto Rico’s large and long-marginalized Dominican minority. She also made poor communities a priority, working to secure federal funds and improving life for thousands on an island with a nearly 45 percent poverty rate.“Her commitment has been through actions, not words, with the impoverished people of San Juan,” political analyst Nestor Duprey said, adding that those same efforts continued after the hurricane.“She has demonstrated an empathy and commitment to her people that have taken her to work day and night,” Duprey said, “very quietly at the beginning.”That changed Friday when Cruz was asked about acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke’s comment that the federal response to Hurricane Maria was “a good news story.”Cruz went on television wearing a black shirt with white letters that read, “HELP US, WE ARE DYING.”“If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said.The next day Trump took to Twitter to accuse Cruz of “poor leadership ability” and added, without elaborating, “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.”Neither Cruz nor her spokespeople responded to requests for comment Sunday. Since Trump’s tweets she has sought to emphasize a message of unity for the good of Puerto Rico in her own activity on the social media platform.Though telegenic and media-savvy, Cruz has been criticized for micromanaging and for wearing herself down to the point where she loses her voice. She has been hospitalized a couple of times for asthma.Critics have questioned her management style, noting that some early supporters — including people who occupied key positions — have resigned or dismissed.She also took heat for offering a job to Puerto Rican independence militant Oscar Lopez Rivera, whose sentence was commuted in January by then-President Barack Obama. Rivera was released from prison in May after serving 35 years for his involvement with a group that claimed more than 100 bombings in the 1970s and ’80s that killed or maimed dozens on the U.S. mainland.In public appearances Cruz has a penchant for hugging people and sometimes crying during interviews, prompting some to praise her sincerity while others call her overly dramatic.In recent days she has gone before news cameras repeatedly, issued more emotional pleas for help and tweeted images of her helping islanders in the hurricane’s aftermath, repeatedly emphasizing the slogan “One goal: saving lives.”Hector Ferrer, the president of Cruz’s party who had a public falling out with her this year over political differences, said that while Cruz may be in the media spotlight, there are plenty of others working hard to help Puerto Rico recover.“I’m going to communities to hand out water and food — without journalists and without photographers,” he said. “There are 78 mayors who are performing miracles with the resources they have. We have to recognize everyone’s work.”But Ferrer said he respected Cruz’s efforts to help Puerto Ricans.“The mayor operates on a different platform and is able to attract more attention,” he said, “and I commend her for that.”"

7559059139,https://www.breitbart.com/news/peru-president-urges-elections-to-end-institutional-crisis/,Peru president urges elections to end ‘institutional crisis’,"Lima (AFP) – Peru’s President Martin Vizcarra on Sunday offered to cut short his term and hold elections to end what he called an institutional crisis.He said in a speech to Congress this would also involve shortening the term of the legislature. As it stands, general elections are scheduled for July next year.Vizcarra’s proposal comes with Peru’s executive and legislative branches locked in a massive power struggle.The president said his idea would need to be passed by the opposition-controlled legislature, and then approved in a referendum.“The voice of the people must be heard,” Vizcarra told lawmakers, as some cheered him and others yelled insults, in a session on Peru’s national day.“Peru is screaming out for a new beginning,” Vizcarra said.If Congress agrees to the president’s proposal, the referendum will be held at the end of the year and the elections “on the second Sunday of April 2020,” Justice Minister Vicente Zeballos said.Shaken by a string of high-profile corruption scandals, Peruvians overwhelmingly approved Vizcarra’s anti-corruption reforms in a December referendum.But he has repeatedly clashed with Congress, which is dominated by the Popular Force party of Keiko Fujimori, who is herself in prison pending trial on corruption charges linked to Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht.Vizcarra had originally threatened to dissolve Congress and force new legislative elections in June, unless lawmakers backed his anti-graft proposals.He won a vote of confidence in Congress at the time, and the government was expected to begin negotiations with the opposition over introducing the reforms.The reforms ranged from campaign finance, to limiting immunity from prosecution that lawmakers enjoy, and blocking those convicted in court from seeking office, as the South American nation of 33 million sought to emerge from the shadow of Latin America’s biggest graft scandal.The proposal to lift legislative immunity turned into the source of the latest conflict between Peru’s executive and legislative branches; Vizcarra proposed giving the Supreme Court power to decide whether to strip a legislator of the protection.Congress, which currently holds the power to lift judicial immunity, rejected the idea.Vizcarra’s proposal to move up elections was met with praise from businesses and analysts, as well as leftist members of Congress, but his opponents accused him of creating too much uncertainty in the government.“The president is looking to shake up Congress, because there has been no improvement in investment or development in the country,” said Fujimori-allied congresswoman Cecilia Chacon.“The president has nothing to show the people, so he has created a media show to keep getting air time,” she argued.– Odebrecht scandal –Under Peru’s constitution, Vizcarra cannot run in the next election. He has said several times that he would not seek to do so.Vizcarra, who was vice president to his predecessor Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, rose to power from relative obscurity 16 months after Kuczynski’s resignation, when the latter was forced out in 2018.Kuczynski, who is 80 and underwent heart surgery in May, is being held under house arrest over accusations of money laundering.Peruvian prosecutors opened an investigation into Kuczynski in June 2018 for his alleged involvement in the sprawling Odebrecht scandal, in which the construction giant paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes across Latin America to secure huge public works contracts.The investigation also looked into two other former presidents, Alejandro Toledo and Alan Garcia.Garcia committed suicide in April after police arrived at his house to arrest him for money laundering.Toledo was arrested in the United States in July to face extradition charges to Peru, but remains in US custody.A fourth former president, Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia were indicted in May for allegedly laundering assets.On July 24, Peru’s Supreme Court said it will decide in August whether to free Keiko Fujimori, accused of accepting $1.2 million in illicit party funding from Odebrecht, from pre-trial detention."

Most of the other candidates from the first round had given their endorsements to Keita, who has had a long career in Malian government.Cisse paid a visit to Keita’s home late Monday along with his wife and family to deliver his concession in person. In an exchange broadcast on the private Malian television station Africable, Cisse told Keita he had come “to congratulate you and wish you all the success you deserve; a success for our country so that you can have the strength to take up the enormous challenges that await you.”Earlier in the day some of Cisse’s supporters had raised allegations of ballot stuffing against Keita’s party, raising the specter of a legal battle. Cisse’s move drew praise from Keita’s supporters late Monday.Keita ran for the presidency in the two previous elections of 2002 and 2007. He also served as foreign minister and National Assembly speaker during his long tenure in Malian government.During his campaign, he ran on a pledge of restoring honor to the country ravaged by an Islamic insurgency that overtook the northern half of the country until French forces arrived in January to oust them from power.Many voters said they had chosen Cisse because they thought he could best resolve the crisis in the north, where secular Tuareg separatist rebels still pose a threat to regional stability. Talks with the rebels from the National Movement for the Liberation of the Azawad are due to begin within 60 days of the formation of Keita’s government and many Malians remain wary of negotiating with the group whose rebellion sparked more than a year of chaos in what was once one of West Africa’s most stable democracies.Voter participation in the town of Kidal, the NMLA’s stronghold, was a mere 12 percent in the first round, and many there will not pledge allegiance to Mali or its new president regardless of who won.The first round of presidential voting had featured technical glitches, leaving some voters unclear about where their polling stations were located. However, European Union and African Union electoral observers offered praise for the Malian runoff vote.Ibrahima Sangho, president of the Malian electoral monitoring group known as APEM, also said Sunday’s second-round vote had gone smoothly.The election was critical to unlocking $4 billion in aid promised by international donors to rebuild the country after political chaos sparked a humanitarian crisis. A democratically elected government is one of the conditions set by the international community, and a transitional government has been in place since not long after the March 2012 coup.In the aftermath of the government’s overthrow, separatist Tuareg rebels and later al-Qaida-linked militants seized control of northern Mali’s towns. The radical jihadists imposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, turning the once-moderate Muslim country into a place where women were whipped for going out in public without veils.France, Mali’s former colonial ruler, launched a military operation in the African country in January after the extremists begin surging southward from their stronghold in the north. The Malian military has been able to regain control over the northern towns of Gao and Timbuktu though its presence remains highly controversial in Kidal.Nearly 200,000 Malians remain in refugee camps in neighboring Niger, Mauritania and Burkina Faso, and an untold number of others are still living in the southern capital of Bamako instead of returning home to the north.___Larson reported from Dakar, Senegal.

The driver of a pickup truck who reached into his vehicle for a rifle and opened fire also was killed as frightened motorists ran for cover.Officer Andrew Moye, Jr., died in the gunfight as dozens of bullets flew Monday afternoon just off a freeway in Riverside, east of Los Angeles. Other drivers ran for cover and two people suffered minor injuries.The two surviving officers are in critical and serious condition, respectively, Riverside Police Officer Ryan Railsback said Tuesday. He would not identify them but said they are expected to survive.KABC-TV reported that a man identified the shooter as his son, Aaron Luther, 49, of neighboring Beaumont.“We don’t know his motive for this crime,” Riverside Police Chief Sergio Diaz said. Investigators were still gathering evidence, Tuesday morning.A CHP officer was doing paperwork to impound the pickup truck when the man reached in, grabbed a rifle and fatally wounded the officer, authorities said. Railsback said he didn’t know what prompted CHP officers to initially stop the truck.“I am devastated by the tragedy,” CHP Commissioner Warren Stanley said in a tweet.Relatives said Moye was 33 and had been with the CHP for about four years.“He was so kind,” his stepmother, Debbie Howard, told KTVU-TV. “You’re not going to hear one bad word about him. He loved this job.”Dennis Luther, the father of the suspected shooter, said he watched the events unfold on television. “It’s hard. I love him. And I’m sorry for the policeman,” he told KABC-TV. “I’m devastated. I just can’t believe it.”Luther said his son served prison time for attempted murder but was released more than a decade ago. He says he doesn’t know what his son was doing with a gun as a felon, which is illegal.Railsback said authorities have not yet determined how he had a rifle.After his truck was impounded, Aaron Luther called his wife to pick him up, his father said.When she arrived, the tow truck was there.“She said she heard ‘pop, pop, pop’ … gunfire, and then a bullet went through the windshield of her car,” Luther said.He said his son recently seemed depressed, was having knee pain and marital problems but was devoted to his two children and a stepchild.“He lived for his kids. That’s what motivated him,” Luther said. “So I don’t know what overcame him. I mean, I wish I did know.”Jennifer Moctezuma, 31, of Moreno Valley told the Los Angeles Times that she was driving home with her 6-year-old twins when a bullet flew through her front windshield.Charles Childress, 56, a retired Marine from Moreno Valley, was in the car behind her.He led the family as they crawled to the bottom of a bridge to hide and none were harmed, the Times reported.“He’s my hero,” Moctezuma said.Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered flags at half-staff Tuesday in the state Capitol.Dozens saluted as the officer’s flag-draped body was removed from a hospital and placed in a hearse. Motorcycle officers then led a procession as the hearse was driven to the county coroner’s office."

The officer, a member of the SWAT team, told officers he did not want to fire on the man but felt he had to. Waller County has been in the spotlight since the death of Sandra Bland in the Waller County jail after her arrest on July 10, 2015.The incident happened in Brookshire, Texas, in Waller County. In the shadow of Bland’s arrest and suicide, Brookshire Police Chief Brandal Jackson told reporters at the scene, “I can tell you one of the things the officer told me was that he was hesitant to fire back at the suspect and this is something we don’t want our officers to start doing.”Asreportedby KHOU’s Josh Chapin in Houston, the officers responded to a call around 4 p.m. on Saturday. One of the suspects was firing at the officer’s car. It was reported that the police officer returned fire through his patrol car window in order to protect himself.Chief Jackson told KHOU, “Our officer didn’t have a chance to retreat, so he fired several shots through the windshield of his vehicle at the suspect.”The police chief said the officer had to respond with more force when someone else was shooting in his direction. “At that time, the officer exited his vehicle, went around it and grabbed his AR-15 and fired several more shots and the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.”The dead man, Roderick Burr, was fighting with his brother and reportedly had a long criminal record.A neighbor who heard the gunfire told KHOU, “They fight a lot. They always argue, but usually it doesn’t escalate to gun play because they are brothers,” said Mary Rae. “I heard like 10 gunshots and then my girlfriend had looked out the window and seen the cops outside armed with their guns.”The Texas Rangers will be investigating the incident according to the police department.Although the neighbor was not an eyewitness to the incident, she told the media, “I feel like there’s a different way it could’ve went down than him having to die.”Breitbart Texas writers were at the other end of Waller County Saturday afternoon and evening for protests and fundraisers being carried out on behalf of Sandra Bland. After being arrested for allegedly assaulting a police officer in the town of Prairie View, Bland killed herself by hanging herself with a plastic trashbag in the county’s jail.Asreportedby Breitbart Texas, a YouTube video message purportedly by the group Anonymous had issued a warning for Waller County police, and in particular, the Waller County Sheriff’s Department. The group planned protests in 35 cities throughout the U.S. on Saturday, August 8th. Breitbart Texas was on the scene of the protest scheduled to be held at the Waller County jail on Saturday evening. In a threatening demand, the group had told the Waller Sheriff’s Office, “We all know where you live. No mercy for murders.” The number of people who showed up for this protest was about equal to the number of journalists, bloggers and photographers who showed up to cover it.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

He faces murder, conspiracy and other charges.Gonzalez has been jailed since authorities say he was found hiding in a car on the downtown campus of the University of San Francisco in the days after the shooting. He told campus officers he was terrified someone was after him.For the first time since his arrest, Gonzalez appeared in court Monday in a dark blue suit and tie instead of a jail jumpsuit. He entered his plea after the judge accepted Villagrana’s plea deal.“Definitely not guilty,” Gonzalez told the judge.David Houston, Gonzalez’s lead attorney, said Villagrana’s guilty plea was an “appropriate development.”“We’re not pleading, because our client is innocent,” Houston told The Associated Press.Karl Hall, Washoe County’s chief deputy district attorney, declined to comment in detail on Villagrana’s plea agreement but told the AP, “I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t think it was fair.”Villagrana was accompanying Pettigrew at an annual motorcycle rally in Reno-Sparks that attracted both gangs to the hotel-casino where the melee broke out. Prosecutors said they have security video of Villagrana shooting a Vagos member in the leg.David Chesnoff, Villagrana’s lead lawyer, told reporters after the judge accepted the plea deal that Villagrana was “sorry things turned out the way they did.”“He wasn’t intending having these events occur,” Chesnoff told KRNV-TV. “He lost his best friend, and that’s a big deal to him.”Another Vagos member who police blamed for starting the fight that led to the killing pleaded guilty in March to second-degree murder. Sentencing is set for Aug. 22 for Gary Rudnick, former vice president of the Vagos’ chapter in Los Angeles.In court Monday, 65 five jurors were called only to be told they had to fill out an additional questionnaire regarding their background and opinions on certain things. Additional jurors later went through the same procedure and were told to return Tuesday when the lawyers would get a chance to question them in detail.The judge earlier granted the prosecution’s request to keep secret the names and other information about all potential jurors, referring to them only by their juror number.Hall said the extra precaution was needed because the suspects allegedly are members of “outlaw motorcycle gangs consisting of thousands of members worldwide.”“The potential for placing a juror or witness in danger is great,” he said."

They say Hernandez is entitled to a fair trial before a jury that hasn’t been “poisoned” by prejudicial information.Prosecutors deny the allegations and say no leaks have come from the investigative team.The two sides agree in principle on a gag order, but the judge asked them both to submit specific proposals.Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the June shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-professional football player."

When they looked out of their hotel window in the early morning hours of Sunday, they saw a group of six black men standing around his friend’s pickup truck. Leeper and his friend came down to ascertain what was going on because the two men had “thousands of dollars of welding equipment in the back of the truck.”There was also a magnetic Confederate flag decal stuck to the side of the truck.When Leeper and his friend approached the truck, the black men told him to move his truck out of their parking space, then appeared to sucker punch Leeper’s friend so hard that he collapsed to the ground, unconscious.Leeper was stuck in the position of defending himself as all six men appeared to take turns hitting him.WARNING: PROFANE LANGUAGE, DISTURBING VIOLENCESalt Lake City police say a witness was able to get a partial plate number from the suspects’ car as they sped off. The witness described the car “as a silver two-door car with the partial plate 9-7-S-20.” The plate was a temporary tag.Police say the suspects could be charged with a hate crime once the District Attorney reviews the evidence.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter:@AWRHawkins.

5308869031,http://www.breitbart.com/news/oxford-dictionaries-names-post-truth-word-of-the-year/,Oxford Dictionaries names ‘post-truth’ word of the year,"London (AFP) – Oxford Dictionaries chose “post-truth” as their word of the year on Wednesday, saying its use had spiked because of the Brexit vote in Britain and the rise of Donald Trump in the United States.“Post-truth has gone from being a peripheral term to being a mainstay in political commentary,” Oxford Dictionaries said in a statement, noting that usage had increased by 2,000 percent since last year.The publisher defined the word as “relating or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”.“It’s not surprising that our choice reflects a year dominated by highly-charged political and social discourse,” said Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Dictionaries.“Fuelled by the rise of social media as a news source and a growing distrust of facts offered up by the establishment, ‘post-truth’ as a concept has been finding its linguistic footing for some time.“We first saw the frequency really spike this year in June with buzz over the Brexit vote and again in July when Donald Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination.”The runners-up for words of the year included the British term “Brexiteer” used for anti-EU advocates.“Alt-right” also made the shortlist, defined as an ultra-conservative grouping in the United States “characterised by a rejection of mainstream politics and the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial content”.Trump’s appointment of anti-establishment media firebrand Steve Bannon, seen as a leader of the “alt-right” movement, as his chief of staff earlier this week has proved highly controversial.– Capturing the mood –Oxford Dictionaries said the word “post-truth” had become “overwhelmingly” associated with politics.Charlotte Buxton, associate editor at Oxford Dictionaries, said the term “caught the public imagination” in Britain and the US, with social networks playing a key role.“It’s tied in quite closely with the social media world now and how people are accessing their news,” she told AFP.“I think it reflects a trend of how emotion and individual reactions are becoming more and more important.“People are restricting their news consumption to sources that don’t claim to be neutral.”Social media networks, in particular Facebook, have come under fire since the US election for allowing “fake news” and misinformation to be widely shared.Google and Facebook responded to the criticism Tuesday by pledging to cut off advertising revenue to fake news sites which some claim influenced the US vote.The term “post-truth” is “reflective of the mood of the past 12 months,” said Buxton, but it has been around for some time.Oxford Dictionaries traced its first use to a 1992 essay by late Serbian-American playwright Steve Tesich in The Nation magazine about the Iran-Contra scandal and the Gulf War.“We, as a free people, have freely decided that we want to live in some post-truth world,” Tesich wrote.“There is evidence of the phrase ‘post-truth’ being used before Tesich’s article, but apparently with the transparent meaning ‘after the truth was known’ and not with the new implication that truth itself has become irrelevant,” Oxford Dictionaries said."

The Buccaneers sent a sixth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft to the Cardinals in exchange for a seventh-round selection and the rights to hire Arians as their next coach.“Bruce Arians is one of the NFL’s most well-respected coaches over the past two decades and we are excited to have him leading our team,” Buccaneers owner/co-chairman Bryan Glazer told Buccaneers.com.“Throughout this process, we focused on finding the right coach with a proven ability to elevate our players and lead our team forward.

7146240977,https://www.breitbart.com/news/powell-says-federal-reserve-will-have-patience-with-future-rates/,Powell says Federal Reserve will have patience with future rates,"Jan. 4 (UPI) — Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank will be more deliberate in its process of raising interest rates in 2019, after four hikes last year.Powell, the Fed chairman since February, made the remarks in a speech Friday during the annual meeting of the American Economic Association and Allied Social Science Association in Atlanta.“With muted inflation readings that we’ve seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,” he said.Powell’s remarks, which followed an optimistic jobs report Friday, helped spur the Dow Jones Industrial Average to rise 550 points in early trading.Sharing the stage with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, Powell cautioned that while there’s economic optimism, the market has plunged from its peak on fears of slowing global growth and the Trump administration’s trade fight with China — and said all factors will be considered when the Fed meets later this month to discuss interest rates.“We’re listening carefully to that and we’re going to be taking that downside risk into account,” he said.The chairman added that if its normalization plan becomes a problem, the central bank would not be slow to adjust.“We wouldn’t hesitate to make a change,” he said.The Federal Open Market Committee will meet again Jan. 29 and 30 to discuss potentially raising interest rates.Financial markets had fallen sharply and experienced some turbulence in 2018, climaxed by a rocky December that continued into the first days of January.In December, the Fed raised rates a quarter-point to 2.5 percent, drawing the ire of President Donald Trump. Overall, it was the ninth increase since the beginning of normalization of rates in December 2015.“It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory,” Trump wrote on Twitter after that rate hike.Powell said Friday that despite Trump’s criticism, he would not resign as Fed chair if the president asked him to."
9784094866,https://www.breitbart.com/news/iraqis-keep-up-koran-protests-after-book-burnings/,Iraqis keep up Koran protests after book burnings,"Iraqi security forces on Saturday dispersed about 1,000 supporters of Shiite Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr who tried to march to Baghdad’s Green Zone housing foreign embassies, believing a Koran had been desecrated in Denmark.The protesters were reacting to reports of an apparent desecration of the Muslim holy book for the third time within a month, with the first two in Sweden already raising diplomatic tensions.On its Facebook page, the extreme right group Danske Patrioter posted on Friday a video of a man burning what seemed to be a Koran and trampling an Iraqi flag.Copenhagen police deputy chief Trine Fisker told AFP that “not more than a handful” of protesters had gathered Friday across from the Iraqi embassy.“I can also confirm there was a book burnt. We do not know which book it was,” she said.Hours later, the Danish Refugee Council office in Iraq’s main southern city of Basra came under armed attack, its executive director for the Middle East, Lilu Thapa, said.“Our staff on the premises at the time were physically unharmed, but there has been damage to the property with structures set on fire.”Sadr, who has a following of millions among the country’s majority Shiite population and wields great influence over national politics, has urged action after Koran desecrations in Sweden.His followers gathered in the pre-dawn darkness in central Baghdad on Saturday, some carrying portraits of Sadr.“Yes, yes to the Koran!” shouted the protesters, mostly young men.Security forces blocked two bridges leading to the high-security Green Zone where governmental institutions and foreign embassies are located.The demonstrators tried to force their way through but dispersed several hours later, following scuffles, an interior ministry official told AFP, speaking anonymously because he was not allowed to brief the media.Another security source said officers used batons and tear gas to repel a small group of demonstrators who managed to break into the Green Zone in an attempt to reach the Danish embassy.Hundreds of Sadr supporters were already behind the storming of Sweden’s embassy in Baghdad early Thursday, over a planned burning by Iraqi refugee Salwan Momika of the Muslim holy book in Sweden, weeks after the same protester lit pages of the Koran.‘Words no longer enough’Later on Saturday, several hundred supporters of another mainly Shiite faction, the pro-Iranian Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) group, gathered on a central Baghdad street, brandishing copies of the Koran and Iraqi flags, an AFP correspondent reported.Iraq’s foreign ministry condemned “the desecration of the holy Koran and the Iraqi flag” in front of the embassy in Denmark.Iraqi President Abdel Latif Rashid called on Western governments to put a stop to the “provocations”.Neighbouring Iran called in Danish ambassador Jasper Vahr to protest, the foreign ministry said.“Book burning in Europe is a reminder of the dark atmosphere of the era of ignorance and the Middle Ages, which is the biggest threat to the freedom of thought in the West,” its Western Europe director general Majid Nili Ahmadabadi said.The Danish foreign ministry said it “condemns the burning of the Koran”.“Burning of holy texts and other religious symbols is a shameful act that disrespects the religion of others,” it said in a statement.The actions of Sweden-based Momika, whose book-burning protest had been permitted by Stockholm on free speech grounds, triggered condemnation across the Muslim world.Sadr said in a vague tweet on Saturday that “words are no longer enough” in defending religion.The chameleon-like figure, who has made several reversals of position over the years, had said in April that he was “freezing” his movement’s activities for a year, though the decision would not affect religious activities.Last August he said he was retiring from politics.Hamzeh Hadad, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said Sadr was indirectly challenging his rivals through the Swedish embassy attack.“This both allows him to show he still possesses force and challenge his rivals’ credibility among the international community,” Hadad wrote on Twitter.The cleric’s supporters had rallied by their hundreds in Baghdad’s Sadr City after Friday prayers, chanting support for the Koran. Protests also erupted in Iran and Lebanon.Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Momika’s protest in Sweden “dangerous”.“The severest punishment for the perpetrator of this crime is what all Islamic scholars agree upon,” Khamenei added, calling for Momika to stand trial in an Islamic country.burs/kir/hc"

I’ll turn it over to you.”“Well thank you very much, thank you for that” said Milo leading a round of applause, “We have an opportunity with England with the UK leaving Europe to do something interesting that is inspired by you guys! I mean we sort of invented you and then we forgot all the lessons we learned that we put into making America.

4599520629,http://www.breitbart.com/news/trial-set-for-videographer-arrested-covering-ferguson/,Trial set for videographer arrested covering Ferguson,"FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) — A video journalist arrested while covering the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown was fatally shot last summer plans to fight the charges at trial.St. Louis-based videographer Mary Moore said she wants her reputation, and her criminal record, cleared. Moore was among 13 people taken into custody during a demonstration outside Ferguson police headquarters in early October, and was charged with municipal violations.Protests have continued since Brown, who was black and unarmed, was shot and killed Aug. 9 by then-Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Moore is one of an estimated two dozen journalists from around the world and among the hundreds of people who’ve been arrested in Ferguson.Moore, whose videos have been used by The Associated Press, TV networks and other news organizations, is among the few journalists to actually go to court. She was charged with failure to comply, failure to disperse and resisting arrest. She said she was not part of the protest, but was simply documenting it on video.“There was no resisting,” she said in a phone interview. “I’m not an idiot.”Moore’s case was set for trial in late June at a brief hearing Tuesday morning in Ferguson’s municipal court — the same venue singled out in a withering U.S. Department of Justice report that found the St. Louis suburb operated a profit-driven system that heightened tensions among black residents for years before Brown’s death.The Missouri Supreme Court appointed a state appeals court judge to hear cases in Ferguson’s courtroom following the ouster of the private-practice attorney who previously presided there. Moore said she is considering whether to seek a change of venue to St. Louis County Circuit Court.The San Francisco-based Freedom of the Press Foundation tracked 19 journalist arrests in August — including two at a McDonald’s just days after Brown’s death — one in September, two in October and two in November. Trevor Timm, executive director of the foundation, said charges were not filed in most cases.Missouri’s online court reporting system does not show state charges against any of the arrested journalists, but Ferguson city charges would not appear there. A Ferguson spokesman did not return messages seeking comment.Timm said there are ample witnesses, along with plenty of video evidence, showing that most of the journalists arrested in Ferguson were simply trying to do their jobs.“The police were acting on a hair-trigger and weren’t respecting the First Amendment rights of both journalists and protesters,” Timm said.Police leaders did not respond to interview requests but have defended the arrests. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, in charge of security in Ferguson in the weeks after the shooting, said some journalists were repeatedly asked to return to sidewalks or safe areas for their own well-being. He said it was often difficult to discern media from protesters.Forty-eight media organizations, including the AP, sent a letter to Ferguson law enforcement officials in August, criticizing treatment of reporters.The only recent event that spurred more arrests of journalists was the Occupy movement in 2011 and 2012. Josh Stearns, director of journalism and sustainability for the New Jersey-based Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, reported that more than 90 journalists were arrested in 12 U.S. cities during Occupy protests.After her arrest, Moore and 12 protesters were taken to a jail in nearby St. Ann, forced to change into orange jail jumpsuits and kept overnight in a single cell with a few other people arrested for unrelated reasons, she said.Moore, who’s in her early 40s but declined to give her exact age, said the arrest has harmed her reputation and has been a source of stress.“There is nothing worse than being accused of something when you know you don’t represent that,” she said. “I take pride in being a civic person.

The manifesto lays out six key “Brexit tests”, which they say will guarantee the nation gets “what it voted for”.Last month, the party laid out its “integration agenda”, promising to ban Sharia courts and the Islamic face veil, to derision in the mainstream media. On Thursday, Mr. Nuttall said he “stood by” the policies and claimed the country was facing an “integration emergency”.The manifesto launch was postponed due to the terrorist attack in Manchester, a point highlighted by the minute silence which followed the event.Party spokesman and MEP (Eastern England) Patrick O’Flynn, party leader Paul Nuttall, London Assembly member Peter Whittall (Photo by Rachel Megawhat/Breitbart London)Mr. Nuttall accused other parties of political correctness and “cowardice” in their failure to name the “cancer” of “Islamic extremism” that was behind such attacks.“Expressing sympathy with those killed in Manchester is important, but it is not enough to light candles or signal our upset on social media”, he said, insisting “action is required on multiple fronts”.“When you are a leader of a political party, you have a duty to set out how you will protect the people of your country from a threat to their entire way of life,” he added.UKIP leader Paul Nuttall (Photo by Rachel Megawhat/Breitbart London)UKIP says it will push for “balanced” net migration of zero, as well as promising to deport extremists, strip returning jihadists of citizenship, and fight the “Islamisation” of schools and female genital mutilation (FGM).They also announced a “compatibility test” for migrants entering the UK, promising to not allow in those who were anti-Western and did not accept gay and female rights.A plan to ban Saudi Arabian funding of mosques, mentioned by Mr. Nuttall in past speeches, was not included in the manifesto, however, as they did not “have time” to research the issues before the snap election.A reporter from Channel 4 News accused UKIP of “blatantly exploiting” the Manchester attack by holding their manifesto launch now and talking tough on terror and immigration. Another report said Mr. Nuttall’s comments on candles could be insulting to those who had lit candles after that attack.However, Mr. Nuttall insisted that “it is the duty of democratic politics to confront the most serious issues of our time, and a general election campaign is the most appropriate moment for those issues to be debated.”Suzanne Evans, a chair and a champion (Photo by Rachel Megawhat/Breitbart London)Suzanne Evans, the party’s former deputy chairman who wrote the manifesto said that some of the blame for the Manchester attack lay with Prime Minister Theresa May.She said Mrs. May talked tough on security, but her “record” as home secretary suggested otherwise. Mrs. May had made cuts to the border force during the migrant crisis, presided over record levels of immigration, and cut the security forces when the threat level was rising."
7514706588,https://www.breitbart.com/news/conditions-in-syrias-al-hol-camp-apocalyptic-red-cross/,Conditions in Syria’s al-Hol camp ‘apocalyptic’: Red Cross,"Geneva (AFP) – The Red Cross warned Thursday that displaced people in and around Syria’s al-Hol camp were facing an “apocalyptic” conditions, urging countries to quickly repatriate family members of suspected foreign fighters.The International Committee of the Red Cross warned of the extreme difficulties facing those left behind after the last vestige of the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate collapsed in northeastern Syria in March.Around 100,000 people in al-Hol and surrounding camps, “are kept in a kind of legal limbo in an unstable place, in a disputed area”, Fabrizio Carboni, who heads the ICRC’s Near and Middle East operations, told reporters in Geneva.“One hundred thousand people who spent the last months, if not years, under the bombs, starved, wounded, sick, traumatised,” he said, adding: “It is just apocalyptic.”The Red Cross is one of the main humanitarian organisations providing assistance inside the overfilled al-Hol camp, which is housing more than 70,000 people, including more than 11,000 family members of suspected IS fighters from dozens of countries.– ‘Politically toxic’ –The issue of whether to repatriate nationals who are family members of suspected jihadists has been a thorny one for Western nations, which have experienced attacks by homegrown extremists and have little interest in seeing more return.Britain has gone so far as stripping IS members of citizenship, while France has said it will only repatriate children and evaluate cases individually.“Our position is to say to states ‘ take your nationals back’,” Carboni said, condemning the stigmatisation of people, especially children, and efforts to create “categories of good victims and bad victims”.“As if kids can be something else than just victims.”Carboni said two thirds of the residents in al-Hol were children, mainly under 12, insisting it was unconscionable to leave them there.“You don’t leave kids in the middle of nowhere exposed to extreme heat, extreme cold, violence,” he said.He warned that countries needed to recognise that “at one stage there will be a price to pay,” and that if they put off dealing with this issue, “it is going to be higher”.ICRC, which runs a field hospital in al-Hol, provides food, water and builds latrines, is doing its best to address the needs of the people stuck in a desperate situation in and around the camp, Carboni said.“But nobody should expect the ICRC to deal with 100,000… for the next 25-30 years,” he said. “This is states’ responsibility.”He acknowledged that for many countries, repatriating family members of suspected jihadists is “politically toxic”, but urged government to take responsibility.Some of the countries which today are reluctant to bring home children in al-Hol “have for decades defended (the principle) that kids are victims and cannot be considered as combatants”, he said.Their foot-dragging on the issue today, he said, “doesn’t look good”."

The prankster has been identified as a 24-year-old IT analyst named Samudera al Hakam Ralial, according toInternational Business Times,and he might end up in prison until he is 30.TheBBCreports that Indonesia’s motorists responded to the porn film much as Americans would have, by capturing the racy footage on their cellphones and uploading it to social media.“The suspect claims he worked alone, but we are still investigating whether he was working alone, whether he had a particular motive or whether he was just fooling around,” said Jakarta police chief Muhammad Iriawan, after the man was taken into custody at his office. He reportedly said he got the idea for his stunt after he saw the billboard display its own login credentials.“Access to pornographic websites is blocked in Muslim-majority Indonesia, which has in the past also banned popular websites such as Tumblr and Vimeo for adult content,” notes the BBC.This raises the possibility that the prank could have been intended as some sort of protest against the law. TheAssociated Pressadds that the steamy billboard show occurred shortly after Friday prayers at Muslim mosques.However, the suspect has evidently told police he did not realize the video to the billboard was pornographic in nature."

Everyone know that civilians are dying,” he screamed.“A four month old and a nine month old — as if we’re the Daesh of Afrin,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.The Observatory says the Turkish operation has left 67 civilians dead so far, 20 of them children.Turkey strongly rejects the figures, saying it is doing everything it can to avoid civilian casualties.Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli said on Tuesday that the Turkish army and its rebel allies “have not harmed any civilian” during the operation.– Turkish teen killed –On Wednesday, the Turkish army said it destroyed 22 YPG targets overnight.Since launching the assault, Turkey and rebel allies have captured 11 villages and the strategic Barsaya hill, according to the Observatory.Barsaya overlooks both the rebel-held Syrian town of Azaz, and Kilis across the border in Turkey.Advancing fighters were facing “fierce resistance from YPG fighters holed up in the mountains, in spite of Turkey’s massive firepower,” said Abdel Rahman.The Observatory said that 85 YPG fighters and 81 pro-Ankara rebels had been killed in the fighting so far.Turkey says seven of its soldiers have been killed.On Wednesday, rockets launched from Syria killed a 17-year-old girl and wounded another resident of a Turkish border town, officials said.The US and France have repeatedly expressed concern over the cross-border offensive, which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week threatened to expand.Erdogan has vowed to “clean up” the YPG-held city of Manbij east of Afrin, where the US has troops as part of its operations against IS.In response, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Tuesday that if the operation turned into an “occupation” of parts of Syria, it would be “totally reprehensible”."

The ban was presented as retaliation against Japan for sanctions it imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.“The administration of Fumio Kishida launched an unprecedented anti-Russian campaign, allowing unacceptable rhetoric against the Russian Federation, including slander and direct threats,” railed the Russian Foreign Ministry in itsstatementWednesday.The Foreign Ministry accused the Japanese government of being “completely biased” and tainted by “the attitudes of the West towards our country.”Other Japanese officials banned from entering RussiaincludedKishida’s cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, Foreign Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, Finance Minister Shun’ichi Suzuki, and Defense Minister Nobuo Kisi.Russia also banned some Japanese businessmen and media figures, including executives from the publisher of Japan’s top newspaper.Prime Minister Kishida, currentlymeetingwith Vatican officials and Pope Francis in Rome to discuss denuclearization,toldreporters the Russian travel ban was “unacceptable.”Kishida enraged Moscow in April byreferringto Russia’s slaughter of Ukrainian civilians as a “war crime” that left him in “deep shock.”“The aggression and war crimes should never be tolerated,” he said while announcing additional Japanese sanctions against Russia.Nikkei Asia— whose executives were among those banned from entering Russia on Wednesday —arguedMonday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should serve as a “wake-up call” for a previously indulgent Japan:When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the administration of then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe refrained from slapping serious sanctions on Moscow, breaking ranks with major Western powers. This time, the Japanese government has taken a clear and strong stance against Russia’s aggression, joining the U.S. and Europe in putting pressure on Moscow. This is undoubtedly a correct response to Russia’s egregious violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty.Nikkei Asia suggested Japan should learn from Ukraine’s experience by strengthening security ties with the U.S., Australia, and Europe, with particular emphasis on Japan’s indispensable alliance with America. Japan should also strengthen its defenses so it can hold out until American help arrives in the event of an attack, much as Ukraine’s remarkable resistance held the Russians at bay for a few crucial weeks."

Tom Garrett (R-VA-5) announced on Monday that he will not seek re-election to a second term in Congress because he is an alcoholic.The announcement came in atwo-minute videoreleased by his campaign and first published at theWashington Post, that featured an emotional Garrett explaining why he will not seek re-election.“The recent attacks on my family and myself are a series of half-truths and whole lies.  They’re driven more by Republicans than by Democrats,” Garrett said in the video.“There’s one area that I haven’t been honest,” he continued.“I am a good man and I am an alcoholic. This is the hardest statement that I have ever publicly made, by far. It’s also the truth. With this in mind, not for fear of losing, or for lack of love for our great nation, today I am announcing that I will not seek re-election,” he concluded.Last week, Politicoreportedthat “Garrett and his wife turned the congressman’s staff into personal servants, multiple former employees to the freshman Republican told POLITICO — assigning them tasks from grocery shopping to fetching the congressman’s clothes to caring for their pet dog, all during work hours.”Garrett made his announcement two weeks and one day before theJune 12 primaryto select the Republican nominee in which he was the only candidate on the ballot.Sources tell Breitbart News that the GOP nominee will likely now be selected by the 37-member executive committee of the Republican Party’s Fifth Congressional District Committee.Though there is no apparent front runner, Garrett’s long-time rival, Michael Del Rosso, may be seeking the nomination.Garrettdefeated Del Rosso and several other candidatesto win the 2016 GOP nominating convention held in the Fifth Congressional District. He went on to win the general election in the district that stretches from the North Carolina border to Northern Virgina, and is bound on the east by Richmond and the west by Lynchburg and includes Charlottesville, by a58 percent to 41 percent margin.Former journalist Leslie Cockburnwon the Democratic nominationin a Fifth Congressional District nominating convention earlier this month,  and party officials have hopes that her well-funded campaign could win the general election in November, forming part of the net gain of 23 seats needed to shift majority control of the House of Representatives from Republicans to Democrats.“Garrett’s chances for victory against the Democratic nominee were recently downgraded from “Likely Republican” to “Lean Republican” by nonpartisan electoral forecasting analysis firm The Cook Political Report,” theCavalier Dailyreportedafter Cockburn secured her party’s nomination.“Given Garrett’s decision — which came only days after a press conference where the congressman said he did plan to seek reelection — Sabato’s Crystal Ball associate editor Geoffrey Skelley predicts the Fifth District race could become closer between the eventual Republican nominee and Democratic nominee Leslie Cockburn,” theCavalier Dailyreportedlate Monday.Accordingto a list kept by the House Press Gallery, Garrett is now the 48th Republican member of the House of Representatives who will not be seeking re-election in 2018. Twenty Democrat members of the House will also not be seeking re-election."
5365520177,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/08/hundreds-police-officers-accused-sexually-exploiting-crime-victims/,Hundreds of Police Officers Accused of Sexually Exploiting Crime Victims,"More than 300 police officers have been accused of abusing their position to sexually exploit people, a report has found.The problem is said to be so widespread that Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has called the abuse of power for sexual gain the “most serious” form of corruption facing police in England and Wales, the BBC hasreported.Over the two years to the end of March 2016, the watchdog uncovered 436 allegations involving 306 officers, 20 PCSOs and eight police staff. All but one constabulary received at least one allegation.And while many of the victims were arrested persons, drug users, and alcohol users, astonishingly, almost 40 per cent of the allegations involved victims of domestic abuse.HM Inspector Mike Cunningham said: “It is at least possible, probably likely, that the problem is more serious than the numbers that have been reported back to us.“What can be worse than a guardian abusing the trust and confidence of an abused person? There can be no greater violation of public trust.”Fewer than half of the allegations were reported to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation, and the report found an “apparent disconnect” between the number of alleged cases and staff dismissals.Alarmingly, the report noted that police officers did not have “sufficiently clear understanding” of where the boundaries lay around pursuing relationships with vulnerable people.And the report found that nearly half the forces inspected were leaving themselves open to corruption with the ranks, as they had no ability to monitor or audit the use of IT systems and databases to identify whether staff had used them to seek out vulnerable victims.To compound the problem, some counter-corruption units, seeking to weed out corruption among police ranks, did not have the ability or capacity to seek information about potential cases.Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4’sTodayprogramme: “Make no mistake about it, the sexual exploitation of vulnerable women is corruption. It is using authority for personal gain, which is a definition of corruption.“It’s the most serious form of corruption. It is an exploitation of power where the guardian becomes an abuser. That is what we are seeing in these cases, and we’re seeing too many.”He added: “The allegations that we collected across the country are not closed allegations, they’re not confirmed or finalised allegations but nevertheless they are allegations.”The home secretary, Amber Rudd, called the report “shocking”, saying: “It undermines justice and public confidence and there is no place in the police for anyone guilty of this sort of abuse.”She added that she has met with the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the College of Policing to discuss what could be done to tackle the problem.Follow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter:Follow @Donna_R_Eor e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com"
1440766450,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA75UDEG0,It's complicated: Lots to sort out on gay marriage,"(AP) It’s complicated: Lots to sort out on gay marriageBy NANCY BENACAssociated PressWASHINGTONTwo landmark Supreme Court rulings that bolster gay marriage rights don’t remove all barriers to same-sex unions by a long shot. Where gay couples live still will have a lot to do with how they’re treated.Some questions and answers about Wednesday’s court rulings:Q: Can you boil down these two big rulings _ 104 pages in all _ to the basics?A: In one case, the court said legally married gay couples are entitled to the same federal benefits available to straight couples. In the other, it cleared the way for gay marriages to resume in California, where voters banned them in 2008.Q: What type of benefits are we talking about?A: More than you’d expect. There are more than 1,000 federal laws in which marital status matters, covering everything from income and inheritance taxes to health benefits and pensions. In states where gay marriage is legal, same-sex couples may actually be looking forward to filing their income taxes next April _ married, filing jointly.Q. Why does it matter where a gay couple lives?A: Even with Wednesday’s ruling, where legally married gay couples live still may affect the federal benefits they can obtain, at least for now. Social Security survivor benefits, for example, depend on where a couple is living when a spouse dies. If that happens in a state that bans or does not recognize the union, it’s not for sure that the surviving spouse will be entitled to the payments. Immigration law, meanwhile, only looks at where people were married, not where they live. It’s complicated.Q: What does the U.S. marriage map look like right now?A: It’s a patchwork. Same-sex marriage is legal in 12 states and the District of Columbia _ representing 18 percent of the U.S. population. When gay marriage resumes in California, the figure will jump to 30 percent. Twenty-nine other states have constitutional amendments that ban gay marriage. Six states have laws that ban it. Two states neither allow gay marriage nor ban it.Q: How many same-sex couples in the U.S. have been legally married?A: The numbers are squishy. The Pew Research Center estimates there have been at least 71,000 legal marriages since 2004, when Massachusetts became the first state to legalize them, but says there are almost certainly more. The Williams Institute, a UCLA-based think tank, says approximately 114,000 couples are legally married and more than 108,000 are in civil unions or registered domestic partnerships. In California alone, 18,000 same-sex couples were married during the 142-day period when gay unions were legal there in 2008.Q: What’s all this talk about DOMA?A: DOMA is the federal Defense of Marriage Act, enacted in 1996. The court on Wednesday struck down a section of that law that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. That’s what had denied legally married gay couples access to a host of federal benefits and programs that are available to straight couples.Q: Why all of the focus Wednesday on California?A: The second case that the court addressed related to a 2008 state ballot proposition that added a ban on gay marriage to the California Constitution. The court didn’t rule on the merits of that ballot proposal, but it left in place a trial court’s declaration that the proposition is unconstitutional. That means same-sex weddings could resume in California in about a month, although a federal appeals court there said it may continue to bar gay marriages even longer if proponents of Proposition 8 ask for a rehearing.Q: What more could the Supreme Court have done?A: Tons. It could have given gay Americans the same constitutional right to marry as heterosexuals. Instead, it sidestepped the looming question of whether banning gay marriage is unconstitutional.Q: What’s President Barack Obama’s take on all of this?A: He welcomed the ruling striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act and directed Attorney General Eric Holder to make sure federal laws are in sync with the ruling. (Obama, who endorsed gay marriage last year, broke with his Republican and Democratic predecessors and declined to defend the law in court.) Already, the Defense Department says it is beginning the process to extend health care, housing and other federal benefits to the same-sex spouses of members of the military.Q: How does the public feel about gay marriage?A: Public support has grown dramatically in the last few years, with a majority now favoring legal marriage for gay couples. There’s even broader support for extending to gay couples the same legal rights and benefits that are available to married straight couples. An Associated Press-National Constitution Center poll last fall found 63 percent favored granting gay couples the same legal benefits straight couples had. And 53 percent favored legal recognition of same-sex marriages.Q: What happens next?A: Supporters of gay marriage will keep pressing to legalize same-sex unions in all 50 states. That means more battles in individual states, and more visits to the Supreme Court.___Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/nbenac"

They decided to abort when their hiding spot was inadvertently discovered by three Afghan goat herders.The Americans allowed the shepherds to get away and set off on an arduous climb to what they hoped would be safety. Except they walked into a massive bombardment from insurgents.Three of the SEALs perished on the mountain and Luttrell was badly wounded. Sixteen other Special Forces, including eight SEALs, were killed when their rescue helicopter was shot down.The injured Luttrell, who managed to escape, was eventually found by an Afghan villager, who at great personal danger took him in until he could be recovered by US troops.A war movie that doesn’t shy away from the brutality of conflict, “Lone Survivor” focuses on the heroism, comradeship and sense of duty that binds SEALs together on the battlefield.Shot on location in New Mexico, the film was supported by the US military, which provided two MH-47 Chinooks and two AH-64 Apaches that were used for scenes at the SEALS’ base camp.It also shows the training and daily regimen of what are some of America’s most elite commandos who took part in the daring raid to kill Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.American public support for the war in Afghanistan has steadily declined, but Berg said he wanted to focus on the soldiers and not the politics.The film, he said, “gives an audience the chance to acknowledge what these guys are doing” and “divorce themselves from these politicians who are deciding where these guys go”.Luttrell, who forged a close relationship with both the director and Wahlberg, said he was delighted with the result.“I’m absolutely overjoyed for what he did. He did a great job,” Luttrell told reporters. “It’s a movie, it’s entertainment. In real life it’s war and there’s not entertainment,” he said.The Navy SEAL spirit is “forged in chaos, that is how you create a brotherhood through blood, pain and sweat,” he said.The actors, including Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana and Emile Hirsch, speak of the privilege of playing the fallen troops.They prepared for their roles by spending time with the men’s surviving friends and family. “I don’t like war, but I love soldiers,” said Wahlberg, who is also a producer of the film.He described Luttrell as a “very, very special individual” who had “inspired me to be a better man”.Asked if he could ever be a SEAL the 42-year-old, who has forged a solidly successful Hollywood career as both an actor and a producer, was honest.“I don’t want to sit on the bench, I want to be in the game. But I don’t know, I have no idea,” he said, referring to the highly selective training and psychological fitness of the commandos.“Lone Survivor” is released by Universal Pictures at selected cinemas on December 27 and goes on general US release January 10."
7276357889,https://www.breitbart.com/news/messi-expected-to-end-argentina-exile-despite-hamstring-trouble/,Messi expected to end Argentina exile despite hamstring trouble,"Buenos Aires (AFP) – Five-time world player of the year Lionel Messi is widely expected to end an eight-month exile and be called back into the Argentina squad ahead of the country’s last get-together before the Copa America.But the 31-year-old Barcelona star is suffering from a hamstring strain and even if he agrees to return, he may not be fit to play in friendlies later this month against Venezuela and Morocco.Interim coach Lionel Scaloni is due to name his squad for the friendlies on Thursday.Messi hasn’t pulled on the light blue and white national team jersey since Argentina were dumped out of the World Cup in June by eventual winners France.He’s also refused to comment on his international future in the last eight months.“I hope, want and believe Leo will come back to the national team,” said Scaloni last year.Messi has missed six friendlies since the World Cup in Russia but most experts believe he will be a part of the squad that travels to Brazil for the Copa America later this year.Whilst he’s built up an almost unprecedented collection of trophies at his club, Messi is running out of time to taste major international success with Argentina.He was on the losing side in major finals three years running from 2014-16 — first to Germany in the World Cup in Brazil, then twice to Chile on penalties in the Copa America, including the one-off Centenary edition of the competition.– Flattered to deceive –Despite nine Spanish La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns with Barcelona, Messi’s only success with Argentina was as part of the under-23 squad that won Olympic gold in Beijing in 2008.He and a generation that can boast Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero, Angel Di Maria of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea forward Gonzalo Higuain have consistently flattered to deceive on the highest stage for Argentina.Still, without Messi, their chances in Brazil would be severely damaged.“I know he can’t wait to come back, I know what he feels for this jersey,” said Argentina’s football federation (AFA) president Claudio Tapia three weeks ago.However, AFA’s new director of national teams, Cesar Menotti says Argentina must focus on the bigger picture rather than relying on Messi.“It’s much more important to build teams and strengthen players to become champions rather than dreaming about Messi’s return,” said Menotti, who guided Argentina to World Cup glory as a coach in 1978.“I don’t think it’s right and he doesn’t deserve the responsibility of winning the World Cup depending on him.”With 65 goals in 128 appearances, Messi is Argentina’s all-time top goalscorer. He’s also Barca’s top marksman ever with more than twice the number of goals as the next best.But he’s never managed to match his club form when operating on the international stage.Since Scaloni replaced Jorge Sampaoli, he has presided over four victories — albeit two of those against minnows Guatemala and Iraq — a draw and a 1-0 defeat to Brazil.He has used the opportunity to blood some young players while the leading lights sat out.But while Aguero, Higuain and Manchester United goalkeeper Sergio Romero are expected to be overlooked once again, Di Maria should return to the squad with the Copa America kick-off just over three months away.But that may just be to offset the potential absence of Mauro Icardi, who has missed the last five matches for club Inter Milan, with whom he is embroiled in a contract dispute.Argentina play Venezuela in Madrid on March 22 and then travel to Tangier four days later to tackle the hosts."

The title will not be awarded.”But Lazio president Claudio Lotito, whose club are second, one point behind Juventus as they chase their first title in two decades, has been keen to return.Juve are also leaning towards a return to action as they target a ninth consecutive ‘Scudetto’.Juve president Andrea Agnelli, as head of the European Club Association (ECA), issued a joint letter with UEFA and European Leagues, stating: “Any decision of abandoning domestic competitions is, at this stage, premature and not justified.”— Foreign players recalled —Italy’s sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora and Italian Football Federation (FIGC) chief Gabriele Gravina have already started to lay the groundwork for a return.Gravina met with members of the FIGC medical commission on Wednesday to analyse the situation and draw up a protocol for a resumption of activities.“If and when we have the green light for a gradual restart, the world of football must be ready,” said Gravina.“Given the role that football plays in Italian society, I am convinced that we can make an important contribution to the whole country.”The date, however, remains uncertain although Gravina has considered several options.At present May 24 seems to be the earliest and June 7 the latest, with 13 rounds of games in some cases to be played through to mid-July.With those dates in mind clubs have started to recall foreign players who had left Italy and need to respect the two weeks quarantine on their return.Inter Milan have seven players who fled the virus to be with their families including Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku and England defender Ashley Young.With at least three weeks of preparation needed, and the current ban running until April 13, training would resume at the end of the month.But some players remain sceptical.“We’re eager to go, but we know this is a global pandemic, some things are bigger and more important than football,” Roma’s England defender Chris Smalling said on Twitter.“We know there will be a lot of games to play in a short time, so we need to be ready for that.“We need two or three weeks training to get back up to full speed — and then it could be a busy run of games.”The final decision will depend on the virus, with 542 reported new deaths on Wednesday in Italy, and at least 140,000 people infected."

1799033441,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA922S4G2,US unemployment aid applications near 6-year low,"(AP) US unemployment aid applications near 6-year lowBy CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABERAP Economics WriterWASHINGTONThe number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell 5,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 305,000, the second-lowest level in six years. Steady declines in applications show that very few companies are laying off workers.The Labor Department said Thursday that the less volatile four-week average declined 7,000 to 308,000, the lowest since June 2007.All states reported their first-time applications on time, a department spokesman said. Applications plummeted three weeks ago because computer upgrades in California and Nevada prevented them from fully reporting their data. Those states have cleared their backlogs, the spokesman said.Applications are a proxy for layoffs. Fewer layoffs suggest employers are confident enough to maintain their staffing levels. But companies have been reluctant to take the next step and ramp up hiring.In fact, job gains have slowed in recent months. Employers have added an average of just 155,000 jobs a month since April. That’s down from an average of 205,000 for the first four months of the year.The unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August, from 7.4 percent in the previous month. But the drop mostly occurred because more Americans stopped working or looking for jobs. The government doesn’t count people as unemployed unless they are actively searching for work.The economy may be growing too slowly to generate stronger hiring. It expanded at a 2.5 percent annual pace from April to June, the Commerce Department reported today. That is up from a meager 1.1 percent annual rate from January through March. For the first six months of the year, the economy has grown at a rate of just 1.8 percent.Economists worry that growth is slowing to an annual rate of 2 percent or less in the current July-September quarter. If correct, that would mark the third quarter in the last four that the annual growth rate has fallen to 2 percent or below, an abnormally low level of economic growth.About 3.9 million Americans received unemployment aid in the week ended Sept. 7, about 23,000 more than the previous week. That total has fallen 32 percent in the past year. Some recipients likely found jobs, but many have simply used up all the unemployment benefits available to them."

Cypriot bank officials said that depositors can access all their money except the amount set by the levy.But that hardly assuaged people who continued to withdraw cash from ATMs until the machines ran out, unsure what or how much would be taxed. Officials said that withdrawing funds on Saturday would not reduce anyone’s levy.The country’s cooperative banks also shut their doors after depositors scurried in hopes of protecting their savings.Unlike commercial banks which remain closed on weekends, cooperative banks customarily open for business on Saturday.The cooperative banks, which represent about a fifth of the island’s banking sector, remained open only for a short time. However, people continued to have access to their funds through ATM machines.“Politicians and senior bank bosses have covered each other’s backs for years, now it’s ordinary people who are paying the price and are being punished,” said Christos Demetriades, 58, milling outside a shut Nicosia cooperative bank branch.One disgruntled customer at a branch in the southern coastal town of Limassol briefly parked his tractor in front of its shut doors in a show of frustration.Cyprus’ Finance Minister Michalis Sarris defended the decision to accept the levy, saying it was either that or a complete economic meltdown.“This was the least worst option,” he told state broadcaster CyBC. “We battled to prevent the country from completely going bankrupt.”News of the levy came as a shock to most people following strict assurances from Cyprus’ President Nicos Anastasiades that he would not accept a deal which required depositors to share in the losses.Cypriot and European officials feared that forcing depositors take a hit would undermine investors’ confidence in Cyprus and other weaker eurozone economies and even possibly lead to bank runs.Spain’s economic ministry said Saturday that the Cyprus deal would not set a pattern for other countries.“This is a specific agreement for Cyprus, with its complex situation and an oversized banking sector, which represents 80 percent of GDP, well above any other country in using the euro,” a ministry statement said. “Because of this, Cyprus’ situation and this agreement are not transferable to any other country in the eurozone.”Cyprus has become the fourth euro area country to get a rescue package to save its banks that took massive losses because of their exposure to toxic Greek debt.The levy stirred up a political firestorm on the tiny island of a million people, with some politicians accusing the government of leading the country to “a tragic dead end.”Government spokesman Christos Stylianides said Cypriot officials had resisted intense pressure to accept a deposit levy of a whopping 40 percent.Bank bosses are meeting with Central Bank officials to figure out their next steps, while Anastasiades, who returns to Cyprus Saturday evening has called for a meeting of party leaders to assess the unfolding situation."

1939539101,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA9SLJAG0,Jury: Arizona convict eligible for death penalty,"(AP) Jury: Arizona convict eligible for death penaltyALBUQUERQUE, N.M.A federal jury on Monday determined Arizona inmate John McCluskey is eligible for the death penalty for murdering an Oklahoma couple during his 2010 prison break.The jury in Albuquerque found McCluskey meets the necessary criteria for a death sentence for his conviction last month on capital murder, carjacking and other charges stemming from the kidnapping and murders of Gary and Linda Haas of Tecumseh, Okla. The couple was passing through New Mexico in August 2010 on an annual camping trip to Colorado.To spare McCluskey the possibility of execution, the defense called several neurological experts in support of their argument that he is incapable of controlling his impulses and making reasoned decisions. They cited brain abnormalities, emotional and physical abuse, and a long history of drug and alcohol abuse.To be eligible for the death penalty under federal law, a person must be at least 18 and have previous convictions for violent crimes. The jury also had to find that McCluskey, 48, willfully and intentionally killed more than one person.The jury now returns for what is expected to be weeks of additional testimony before deciding whether he should be executed or sentenced to life in prison without parole.During closing arguments in the first phase of the penalty trial, defense attorney Teri Duncan said jurors should spare McCluskey the death penalty not of out of sympathy, but out of understanding of how his brain works and because of his inability to control his impulses.Duncan also quoted one of her favorite childhood books, “Bless Me, Ultima,” where one of the characters teaches that “when you understand, you see it is not evil.”Prosecutor Michael Warbel, however, argued that McCluskey acted willfully.“We are talking about what he intended when he pointed that gun at Gary Haas and shot him in the head,” Warbel said. “We are talking about what he intended when he pointed that gun at Linda Haas and pulled the trigger twice.”The same jury on Oct. 7 convicted McCluskey of 20 counts of aggravated murder, carjacking and other charges.McCluskey was serving 15 years for attempted second-degree murder, aggravated assault and discharge of a firearm when he and two other prisoners escaped from a medium-security prison near Kingman, Ariz., in July 2010 with the help of his cousin and fiancee, Casslyn Welch.One inmate was quickly captured after a shootout with authorities in Colorado, while McCluskey, Welch and inmate Tracy Province headed to New Mexico.Testimony showed the trio, hot and cramped from three days in a small car without air conditioning, targeted the Haases at a rest stop near the New Mexico-Texas state line for their truck and travel trailer.Province and Welch pleaded guilty last year to charges of carjacking resulting in death, conspiracy, the use of a firearm during a violent crime and other charges. They both said McCluskey was the triggerman."
7675618370,https://www.breitbart.com/news/philippines-begins-mass-vaccinations-after-polio-returns/,Philippines begins mass vaccinations after polio returns,"Manila (AFP) – Parents lined up from sunrise holding sleeping infants as the Philippines launched a campaign on Monday to vaccinate millions of children against polio, which has re-emerged nearly two decades after the nation’s last cases.Years of falling vaccination rates, made worse by the botched rollout of a dengue vaccine, culminated in an outbreak of the preventable disease in September.“This is for the welfare of my child,” Ruth Miranda told AFP after the vaccine was squirted into her child’s mouth at the Manila slum they call home.Miranda’s child is among scores who are unprotected in the capital of about 13 million people, where vaccination rates of young children plunged from 77 percent in 2016 to a mere 24 percent in June.The atmosphere at the event in Manila was festive — with ice cream vendors and music — but the stakes for the campaign are high.Polio, which can cause paralysis and can be fatal in rare cases, has no cure and can only be prevented with several doses of oral and injectable vaccines.Two cases were detected in September, the first polio infections in the Philippines since 2001, adding to the woes of a country already hit by deadly measles and dengue epidemic.The risk of the disease spreading within the Philippines is high, according to World Health Organization, due to low immunisation coverage partly blamed to a dengue vaccine scandal.The Philippines was the first nation to use Dengvaxia in a mass programme in 2016, but a botched rollout led to claims that children had died after being vaccinated.A dramatic drop in vaccine confidence followed, with trust plunging from 93 percent in 2015 to 32 percent in 2018, according to a study led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.The Philippines polio outbreak has been traced back to the weakened form of the virus used in vaccines, which is excreted by people for a time after they receive it.According to the WHO, that form can mutate and spread in the surrounding community when immunisation rates get too low."

Lawmakers voted 418-0 to pass the bill Wednesday.The scandal came to light after it was discovered that sexually explicit photos of female and male Marines were being shared on a secret Facebook page.Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, the bill’s sponsor, says the “Neanderthals” who posted the photos aren’t emblematic of the vast majority of U.S. troops.

Ashraf Kabir.“We brought them together and asked them to go back by boat,” he said. “We asked them to head for Myanmar.

1371570426,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA6OGSJ00,Missouri man gets 20 years in triplet mom's death,"(AP) Missouri man gets 20 years in triplet mom’s deathBy ALAN SCHER ZAGIERAssociated PressJACKSON, Mo.A frustrated judge, begrudging prosecutors and chagrined family members all conceded Thursday that offering a plea deal to a southeast Missouri man accused of killing his estranged wife, a mother of 5-year-old triplets who was missing for almost two years before her body was found last week on an island in the nearby Mississippi River, was inadequate.But it was the best option available, they said, because 42-year-old James Clay Waller II was the only person who could lead authorities to Jacque Waller’s body, while ensuring a conviction and offering grieving family and friends closure for the 39-year-old mother who disappeared in 2011.Clay Waller was given a 20-year prison sentence Thursday after pleading guilty to second-degree murder and admitting in a barely audible voice _ inside a packed Cape Girardeau County courthouse _ that he’d murdered the triplet’s mom. The shaken inmate struggled to admit choking his wife to death before dumping her body on an island on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River nearly two years ago.Before being sentenced, Clay Walker also listened to his 7-year-old son publicly disown him for life, calling his father a “big, fat jerk.”“You killed our mom,” the child said in a taped statement. “I thought you were a good guy. Now I know you’re not … I wish you weren’t my dad.”Few left the courthouse satisfied with the outcome. Both Jacque Waller’s sister and Circuit Judge Benjamin Lewis said they weren’t happy with the lighter sentence, but had few options. The plea was conditional on Clay Waller II leading investigators to his wife’s body and his confession in court. Her body wasn’t found until May 29 in Alexander County, Ill., and Clay Waller continued to share details about the killing with investigators earlier this week.“I did not want this deal,” said Waller’s sister, Cheryl Brenneke, who has custody of the triplets and plans to adopt the two girls and one boy. “My mother and father and these children deserved to bury her, though.”Lewis acknowledged that “there will be a number of people critical of this plea agreement. However none of those critics could provide the body of Jacque Waller.”“That is not what you deserve, but it will have to do,” he said in handing down the 20-year sentence. Under the original charge, Waller could have faced the death penalty or life in prison without parole.Clay Waller is serving a five-year term in federal prison for threatening Brenneke over the Internet. His sentence in the murder case will run concurrent with the federal case, officials said. Under Missouri law, he must serve at least 85 percent of his sentence _ or 17 years _ minus time served.He was originally charged with first-degree murder and arrested in April 2012 even though her body had not yet been found. He had faced a September trial in Cape Girardeau County Circuit Court.“It’s bitter, because Jacque Waller was sentenced to death, and her family was sentenced to life without Jacque,” said Cape Girardeau Sheriff John Jordan.Prosecutors said they insisted on at least a 20-year sentence, though Waller’s public defenders tried to negotiate a more favorable deal. County prosecutor Chris Limbaugh said he expects Waller to serve the entire 20 years.“It was decided that it was more important to get Jacque back,” he said.Jacque Waller had been missing since June 1, 2011, the same day the couple met with a divorce lawyer and argued over money after living apart for the previous three months.Her Honda Pilot was found along Interstate 55 a day after she disappeared, its tires slashed, after the car had been seen the day before at Clay Waller’s home. Several searches since then turned up sporadic leads, including the discovery of her purse near where the car was found.The FBI said last year that Clay Waller suggested to his father that he had broken Jacque Waller’s neck and buried her in a hole that he had dug in advance. But Clay Waller had previously not made any confession to police, and his father died before he could testify.Waller spoke softly as he admitted guilt, his voice barely audible in the packed Jackson courtroom. He kept his back turned as Brenneke spoke, facing the judge but glancing downward while fidgeting in place.“We got in an argument,” he said, describing an assault on his wife at the Jackson home he was living in after the couple split. “I lost my temper.”But investigators said Waller already had planned to kill his wife, digging a 6-foot hole in the sand the previous day and scouting out the burial location via helicopter. Jordan said Clay Waller lured his wife to his home by convincing her that their son was there. Instead, the child was with Clay Waller’s girlfriend.Jordan said Waller was motivated in part by jealousy. Before her death, Jacque Waller had again found love with a new boyfriend, and the couple planned to move in together, her sister said Thursday.Brenekke spoke to Waller with rage and contempt, her voice quavering.“To someone who has always considered himself the smartest guy in the room, you just look like a skinny, washed up, murdering con man to everyone in this room,” she said. “I knew immediately that you killed my sister.”After Brenneke spoke, Waller heard the taped statement by his son in which the child said, “I never want to see you again for my entire life.”Stan Rawson, Jacque Waller’s father, said the family accepted the plea deal in order to remove the uncertainty over their daughter’s fate. He said Jacque Waller was a long-time victim of domestic abuse, and blamed himself for not taking his daughter’s warnings about Clay Waller’s temper seriously.“She thought she could control him,” Rawson said. “Needless to say, she couldn’t.”___Follow Alan Scher Zagier on Twitter at http://twitter.com/azagier"

7050762278,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2014/12/21/msnbcs-al-sharpton-releases-statement-on-murders-of-2-ny-policemen/,MSNBC’s Al Sharpton Releases Statement on Murders of 2 NY Policemen,"Just before 3PM on Saturday, two New York police officers were ambushed and assassinated by a single gunman as they sat in their marked cruiser in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Despite weeks of inciting protests, almost immediately MSNBC’s Al Sharpton put out a statementdenouncingthe murders.Killed were officers Wenjian Liu, 32, a seven-year veteran, and Rafael Ramos, 40, who had been with the department since 2012.The murderer, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, has been identified as a member of the Black Guerilla Family, an offshoot of the Black Panthers, a group he joined when he was in prison in California. Police revealed that Brinsley had posted several entries on social media warning that he was about to take actions in retaliation for the death of New Yorker Eric Garner, the man who died as police were attempting to arrest him in July. On the heels of the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, the non-indictment for Garner’s death sparked massive protests against police.Despite presiding over many of these anti-police protests where he touted the chant “No Justice, No Peace,” Sharpton said in astatementthat he was “outraged” by the murderous attack on the two officers.I have spoken to the Garner family and we are outraged by the early reports of the police killed in Brooklyn today… Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown in connection with any violence or killing of police is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases.We have stressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown. We have been criticized at National Action Network for not allowing rhetoric or chanting of violence and would abruptly denounce it at all of our gatherings. The Garner family and I have always stressed that we do not believe that all police are bad, in fact we have stressed that most police are not bad.We plan to hold a press conference in the morning to express our outrage and our condolences to the families and the police department. Details to follow.Sharpton followed that up with an even more strongly-worded statement onTwitter.“I am outraged at the killing of 2 police officers in Brooklyn. That is why we stress non violence as the only way to fight for justice,” Sharptontweeted. “An eye for an [eye] leaves the whole world blind. We all at NAN express our prayers and condolences to the families of the 2 NYC officers.”The platitudes did not satisfy retired NYPD detective Harry Houck whoappeared on CNNto discuss the murders. He denounced Sharpton’s ubiquitous protests as being “predicated on lies.” He went on to say, “We have two dead police officers, and I guess Al Sharpton got what he wanted.”Also on Saturday, despite repeatedlysiding with protesters over the policeand announcingsupport for those who oppose police, Obama Attorney General Eric Holder came out with his own statement denouncing the murders.I condemn this afternoon’s senseless shooting of two New York City police officers in the strongest possible terms. This was an unspeakable act of barbarism, and I was deeply saddened to hear of the loss of these two brave officers in the line of duty.On behalf of all those who serve in the United States Department of Justice, I want to express my heartfelt condolences to the officers’ loved ones and colleagues. I will make available all of the resources of the Department to aid the NYPD in investigating this tragedy.This cowardly attack underscores the dangers that are routinely faced by those who protect and serve their fellow citizens. As a nation we must not forget this as we discuss the events of the recent past. These courageous men and women routinely incur tremendous personal risks, and place their lives on the line each and every day, in order to preserve public safety. We are forever in their debt.Our nation must always honor the valor — and the sacrifices — of all law enforcement officers with a steadfast commitment to keeping them safe. This means forging closer bonds between officers and the communities they serve, so that public safety is not a cause that is served by a courageous few, but a promise that’s fulfilled by police officials and citizens working side by side.Finally, on Saturday afternoon New York Mayor Bill de Blasio held a press conference denouncing the murders. Butde Blasio has also sidedwith forces aligned against his own officers evoking the ire of New York’s finest.Police have been at odds with the mayor over his many anti-police statements, so much so that only days ago New York City’s police union warned the mayor thathe is unwelcome at any funerals of police officers. And as de Blasio made his way to his press conference about today’s shooting,dozens of policemen turned their backs on himas he walked down the hall.That same night the city’s police union chief also condemned de Blasio and those who have been attacking his fellow officers.“There is blood on many hands tonight–those that incited violence on the streets under the guise of protest, that tried to tear down what New York police officers did every day,” NYPD union presidentPat Lynch saidon Saturday night. “That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor.”Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthustonor email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com."
7513950293,https://www.breitbart.com/news/christine-lagarde-continues-to-break-glass-ceilings-2/,Christine Lagarde continues to break glass ceilings,"Washington (AFP) – Christine Lagarde has made a career out of breaking glass ceilings in the halls of international finance and is now poised to break one more, leading the European Central Bank.The former lawyer was the first woman to serve as finance minister from any Group of Seven nation and then the first to lead the International Monetary Fund.The silver-haired Lagarde, 63, took the helm in 2011 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and is credited with steering the Washington-based IMF through turbulent economic waters, including handling of the Greek economic collapse.Her second five-year term as managing director of the global crisis lender ends in two years, which makes her the second leader of a global financial institution to leave early to move to another position, following Jim Yong Kim’s decision early this year to step down as president of the World Bank.But as she prepares for an eight-year term leading the ECB in November, she will be in a familiar place as trailblazer at a difficult time, accustomed to being the only woman in the room.She was the first female chairman of a major global law firm — the US-based Baker and McKenzie — and was France’s first woman economy minister when named by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007.She speaks openly about the sexism she has faced in her career, difficulties she faced having a family and a career, and is a fierce advocate for advancing women worldwide.– Fierce advocate for women –She makes a strong economic case for having more women in positions of power, including saying the financial crisis may not have happened if Lehman Brothers had instead been “Lehman Sisters.”“Greater emphasis on women in organizations leads to better governance and decision-making. I maintain that women have a different approach to risk than men,” she told Elle magazine earlier this year.“Our studies have shown that, by removing barriers to women’s participation in the labor market, GDP could increase significantly,” and productivity would rise, increasing wages for men and women.However, she is not an economist which means she will be another first: the first ECB president who did not lead a national central bank. This could make her a target for criticism, especially if the management of the economic slowdown in Europe goes wrong, amid Brexit and rising trade tensions.But one former IMF official, said her leadership of the fund, with its 189 members, makes her “is exceptionally qualified” to run the ECB.And another associate, who asked not to be identified, said “She knew how to impose the calm without posing as morally superior,” instead displaying “a touch of humanity.”The stamina of the former synchronized swimmer, who represented France as a youth, is legendary. She still exercises everyday — sometimes in her seat during meetings — has not eaten meat in 40 years, and told Elle of her skills in pretending to drink wine at working dinners.Born to middle-class teacher parents, she went to school in the northern port city of Le Havre and at a prestigious girls boarding school outside of Washington before going on to study at universities in France.– Praise and Blemish –There are many fans of Lagarde in financial and diplomatic circles.“Christine Lagarde can take credit for bequeathing an IMF that has become the premier international financial institution,” said Masood Ahmed, a former IMF official who now leads the Center for Global Development, an anti-poverty think tank.“She brought a rare combination of political sensitivity, personal empathy and tough but loyal leadership for her institution at a trying time for the world economy. She will be a hard act to follow,” Ahmed told AFP.She has been adamant that trade tensions are the “principal threat” to the global economy but acknowledges the strains of globalization and digitalization of the economy, which have left some workers behind and helped to fuel the rise of populism.Despite a stellar career, her record suffered one significant blemish, when she was convicted in a French court in 2016 for failing to challenge a 404-million-euro ($422 million) award to flamboyant French businessman Bernard Tapie in 2008 over the sale of sportswear brand Adidas.However, the court did not impose a fine or jail sentence, as had been the case for some of her predecessors.Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister like Lagarde, resigned in disgrace in 2011 after being accused of attempted rape in a New York hotel.And Rodrigo Rato, a former Spanish economy minister who ran the IMF from 2004-2007, is in prison for embezzlement.burs-hs/dg"
1352532809,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2010/09/12/Bashing-Bush-and-Boehner-Wont-Work--Obamanomics-Is-the-Problem,Bashing Bush and Boehner Won't Work: Obamanomics Is the Problem,"Under pressure from a barrage of bad midterm-election polls, President Obama has gone on the campaign trail to blame Pres. George W. Bush for all our economic problems, and to bash House Republican leader John Boehner as nothing more than a Bush retread.In Friday’s dreary news conference, Obama acknowledged that economic progress is “painfully slow,” and that voters may blame him for the economy. Yet he nonetheless continued to finger Bush “for policies that cut taxes, especially for millionaires and billionaires, cut regulations for corporations and for special interests, and left everyone else pretty much fending for themselves.”“Millionaires and billionaires” has become Obama’s favorite phrase as he calls for tax hikes on the wealthy and renews his attacks on Bush. In Cleveland last week, Obama actually blamed the Bush tax cuts for the financial meltdown and severe recession. Now that’s a reach. A big reach.While Mr. Bush made plenty of economic mistakes, his 2003 reductions of marginal tax rates led to more than 8 million new jobs in the next four and a half years. Under Bush, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.6 percent.And almost all economists agree that the 2007-08 financial meltdown was a housing-bubble and credit event. It had nothing at all to do with cutting taxes.Regarding John Boehner, Obama slammed the GOP leader eight times in Cleveland. He claimed “no new policies from Mr. Boehner,” saying the Republican leader’s philosophy “led to this mess in the first place: cut more taxes for millionaires and cut more rules for corporations.”Well, none of this is going to work come November 2.Take a good look at the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC poll. It is very revealing on these points.Voters were asked, if Republicans win control of Congress, will they return to the economic policies of George W. Bush, or will they have different ideas to deal with the economy? The response: 58 percent said different ideas, 35 percent said the policies of George W. Bush. Voters were then asked, if Democrats maintain control of Congress, will they continue with the economic policies of Barack Obama, or will they have different ideas on the economy? The response: 62 percent said the policies of Obama, 32 percent said different ideas.The poll also found that 56 percent of voters disapprove of Obama’s handling of the economy while 39 percent approve; that 71 percent disapprove of the job Congress is doing; and that 62 percent think it better that different parties control Congress and the White House. Overall, on the generic congressional vote, likely voters favor Republicans over Democrats 49 to 40 percent.Clearly, Obama is barking up the wrong tree with his assaults on Bush and Boehner.It’s the Obama agenda, especially on the economy, that has voters agitated. It’s a couple trillion dollars worth of big-government spending stimulus. It’s add-ons like cash for clunkers, cash for caulkers, and homebuyer tax credits. It’s the never-ending mortgage-default assistance. It’s two years of unemployment benefits. It’s more government-union bailouts for the states. It’s GM, Fannie, and Freddie. And of course, it’s Obamacare, which remains hugely unpopular.Folks simply don’t think they got much for their money. And now they want to get their money back. They even want strict constitutional limits on the size, scope, spending, and taxing of the federal government, which has just made the biggest power grab they’ve ever seen.The point is, your average Joe the Plumber in all those flyover states has probably barely even heard of John Boehner. This Boehner attack reminds me of the GOP’s futile attempt to demonize Nancy Pelosi in the autumn of 2006. Back then, nobody had much heard of Pelosi. But people voted the Republicans out because of overspending, bridges to nowhere, corruption, and the Iraq War.Today, while the GOP is developing a platform that is expected out at the end of the month, voters seem to know that a nearly united Republican party opposes Bailout Nation, big spending and borrowing, Obamacare, and a new national energy tax. Republicans are far from perfect. But they have slowly developed a good message: Freeze spending, keep tax rates down, hold back the redistributionist government tide, help entrepreneurs, reward success, and create jobs and economic growth through the traditional American route of private-sector business, not government planning.In the next seven weeks, if Republicans can stay on this message, they will win big."

6741194831,http://www.breitbart.com/news/north-koreas-kim-meets-chinas-xi-following-trump-summit/,North Korea’s Kim meets China’s Xi following Trump summit,"Beijing (AFP) – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met his Chinese President Xi Jinping  in Beijing Tuesday to brief his sole major ally on his unprecedented summit with US President Donald Trump.Kim’s third trip to China since March comes as Beijing tries to strengthen its role as a mediator between the US and North Korea, where it claims compelling security and economic interests.The North’s leader, who is believed to have landed in the Chinese capital Tuesday morning, met Xi at Beijing’s ornate Great Hall of the People, according to state broadcaster CCTV.The young autocrat was given a full ceremonial welcome, including a military revue and a gaggle of adoring children shouting out welcomes.During the meeting, the two leaders discussed the prospects for denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula as well as the potential for developing the North’s economy, CCTV reported.The United States relies on China to enforce UN sanctions against the North, giving Beijing potential leverage in a looming trade war with Washington.Kim will be in Beijing through Wednesday, state media previously reported.“We hope this visit will help deepen the China-DPRK (North Korea) relations and strengthen our strategic communication on major issues to promote regional peace and stability,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular press briefing.The visit is Kim’s third to China since March, when he made his inaugural foreign trip as leader.Previous trips had been kept secret until Kim returned home. It was not clear why Chinese state media broke with the precedent.In addition to discussing last week’s Singapore summit, Kim is expected to ask China for help in easing economic sanctions in return for his pledge to denuclearise, according to Wang Dong, an international relations expert at Peking University.“The Chinese and North Korean leaders are carrying out consultations on how to jointly move the Korean nuclear issue forward,” Wang said.Following the historic summit on June 12, China suggested the UN Security Council could consider easing the economic restrictions on its Cold War-era ally.China may not have been at the table for the historic summit in Singapore but it retains strong influence behind the scenes, Wang said.The visit shows that China is “key” to the talks, the analyst added. “It reflects that China is indispensible to the entire Korean nuclear issue.”– ‘Differences ahead’ –In a joint statement with Trump following the Singapore summit, Kim pledged to “work toward the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula”.Trump hailed this as a concession but critics said the stock phrase long used by Pyongyang stopped short of longstanding US demands for North Korea to give up its atomic arsenal in a “verifiable” and “irreversible” way.It is now urgent for Xi and Kim to discuss how North Korea will work towards meeting US demands, said Beijing-based international relations commentator Hua Po.“There may be differences ahead between the DPRK and the US in regards to denuclearisation, because the US wants irreversible and verifiable denuclearisation. It may be difficult for Kim Jong Un to accept,” Hua told AFP.“Therefore, both China and the DPRK want to strengthen communication and form an overall strategy to deal with the United States going forward,” Hua added.In return for the denuclearisation pledge, Trump made the shock announcement that he would stop joint military drills with South Korea, long seen as a provocation by Pyongyang and Beijing.Analysts saw this as a clear sign of Beijing’s influence.Beijing has repeatedly called for a “suspension for suspension” approach where the North would stop its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the US and South Korea halting military exercises.Washington had previously rebuffed the proposal. But on Tuesday, the US and South Korean militaries confirmed they have called off a scheduled major joint exercise following Trump’s order.Trump had raised eyebrows by describing the exercises as “provocative” — a term used by the North.jch-mis-ric-rld-dly/lth/sm"
7300608942,https://www.breitbart.com/news/mourners-pay-tribute-to-victims-of-new-zealand-shootings/,Mourners pay tribute to victims of New Zealand shootings,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — A steady stream of mourners paid tribute Sunday at a makeshift memorial to the 50 people slain by a gunman at two mosques in Christchurch, while dozens of Muslims stood by to bury the dead when authorities finally release the victims’ bodies.Hundreds of flowers were piled up amid candles, balloons and notes of grief and love outside the Al Noor mosque. As a light rain fell, people clutched each other and wept quietly.“We wish we knew your name to write upon your heart. We wish we knew your favorite song, what makes you smile, what makes you cry,” read one of the tributes, which contained cut-out paper hearts under a nearby tree. “We made a heart for you. 50 hearts for 50 lives.”Two days after Friday’s attack, New Zealand’s deadliest shooting in modern history, relatives were still waiting for authorities to release the bodies. Islamic law calls for bodies to be cleansed and buried as soon as possible after death, usually within 24 hours.Supporters arrived from across the country to help with the burials in Christchurch and authorities sent in backhoes to dig graves in a site that was newly fenced off and blocked from view with white netting.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said authorities hoped to release all the bodies by Wednesday, and Police Commissioner Mike Bush said authorities were working with pathologists and coroners to complete the task as soon as they could.“We have to be absolutely clear on the cause of death and confirm their identity before that can happen,” Bush said. “But we are so aware of the cultural and religious needs. So we are doing that as quickly and as sensitively as possible.”Police said they had released a preliminary list of the victims to families, which has helped give closure to some who were waiting for any news.The suspect in the shootings, 28-year-old white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant, appeared in court Saturday amid strict security, shackled and wearing all-white prison garb, and showed no emotion when the judge read one murder charge and said more would likely follow.Tarrant had posted a jumbled 74-page anti-immigrant manifesto online before the attacks and apparently used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live video of the slaughter.Ardern said the gunman had sent the manifesto to her office email about nine minutes before the attacks, although she hadn’t gotten the email directly herself. She said her office was one of about 30 recipients and had forwarded the email to parliamentary security within a couple of minutes of receiving it.Bush said at a news conference that another body had been found at Al Noor mosque as they finished removing the victims, bringing the number of people killed there to 42. Another seven people were killed at Linwood mosque and one more person died later at Christchurch Hospital.Thirty-four wounded remained at the hospital, where officials said 12 were in critical condition. A 4-year-old girl at a children’s hospital in Auckland was also listed as critical.Dozens of Muslim supporters gathered at a center set up for victims, families and friends across the road from the hospital, where many had flown in from around New Zealand to offer support. About two dozen men received instructions on their duties Sunday, which included Muslim burial customs.Abdul Hakim, 56, of Auckland, was among many who had flown in to help.“As soon as people die, we must bury them as soon as possible,” Hakim said. “We are all here to help them in washing the body, putting them in the grave.”Javed Dadabhai, who flew from Auckland after learning about the death of his 35-year-old cousin, Junaid Mortara, said the Muslim community was being patient.“The family understands that it’s a crime scene. It’s going to be a criminal charge against the guy who’s done this, so they need to be pretty thorough,” he said.Still, it was hard, he said, because the grieving process wouldn’t really begin until he could bury his cousin.People across the country were still trying to come to terms with the massacre that Ardern described as “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”At the Vatican, Pope Francis offered prayers for “our Muslim brothers” killed in the attack. At his traditional Sunday prayer, Francis renewed “an invitation to unite in prayer and gestures of peace to oppose hatred and violence.”The gunman livestreamed 17 minutes of the rampage at the Al Noor mosque, where he sprayed worshippers with bullets. Facebook, Twitter and Google scrambled to take down the video, which was widely available on social media for hours after the bloodbath.The second attack took place at the Linwood mosque about 5 kilometers (3 miles) away.Ardern has said Tarrant was a licensed gun owner who legally bought the five guns he used.At a news conference, the prime minister reiterated her promise that there will be changes to the country’s gun laws. She said her Cabinet will discuss the policy details Monday.Arden used some of her strongest language yet about gun control, saying that laws need to change and “they will change.”Neighboring Australia has virtually banned semi-automatic rifles from private ownership since a lone gunman killed 35 people with assault rifles in 1996.Before Friday’s attack, New Zealand’s deadliest shooting in modern history took place in 1990 in the small town of Aramoana, where a gunman killed 13 people following a dispute with a neighbor.___Associated Press writers Kristen Gelineau and Stephen Wright in Christchurch, and Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, contributed."

Chancellor Hammond has been reported in theBritish pressas leading a faction within the government pushing for a second Brexit referendum, a move thought of by some as intended to prevent Brexit going ahead at all.Conservative MP and remain-supporter Margot James rebuked Francois for his comments, taking to Twitter and saying “so awful to hear the vindictive and insulting language used by Mark Francois about the Chancellor who is doing a good job in government”.This is not the first time Mark Francois has been openly critical of government ministers on Brexit. On Monday he told talkRadio that “up themselves” politicians, including those in his own party, were plotting to try and disrupt or cancel Brexit. He singled out Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve,saying of them“It’s a coup against the British people. The bottom line is to try and destroy Brexit. These men are utterly determined and know exactly what they’re doing.”Francois isn’t the only MP to have been outspoken about Brexit failings, with leave supporter and Conservative MP Henry Smithwritingwith evident frustration “Enough of this bullshit, the British people by the largest majority in UK poll history voted to leave the EU – just do it and move in to a better future…”Despite the fact that 80% of MP’s ran on manifestos pledging to leave the EU, the house has failed to agree on any way forward so far. They have, though, rejected the possibility of a World Trade Organisation (no deal) Brexit, despite arecent pollshowing that 57 per cent of the public now supports voting to leave on WTO terms.Following the failure of all the indicative votes in Parliament, it is possible that Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement will be brought back to the commons for a fourth time this week."

Out of the 523,000 – who were monitored at least seven days after receiving the second dose – 544 were infected with COVID-19. Of those 15 needed hospitalization with four in severe condition.“Anyone who has not been vaccinated so far, please hurry up and make an appointment as soon as possible,” she said. “Protect yourself from a serious illness and, God forbid, death as well as the possibility that you will infect and endanger others.”Last month, the HMO revealed hospitalizations had begun to decrease dramatically in the over-60s 18 days after receiving the first shot. Maccabi monitored more than 50,000 members.Among the general population, around 0.65 percent are infected in a given week,The Times of Israelreported citing a top immunologist, a stark contrast to the 0.015 percent infected after becoming fully vaccinated."

That’s in addition to the 49,100 whichReuters reportshave signed up in 12 states with their own individual exchange websites.The official numbers for the federal site will be released sometime this week by the Department of Health and Human Services. If the new estimates are accurate, the numbers reported by CBS, the WSJ and Reuters demonstrate that the administration is far behind expected enrollment numbers.The AP revealed more thanthree weeks agothat the administration’s target figure for the month of October was half-a-million people. This was considered a slow roll out, one which allowed for a ramp up as the enrollment period progressed into next year. Now it appears the actual total may be just 20 percent of that.There have been reports from insurers forseveral weeksthat the numbers enrolling through the site were low. The White House seemed to be trying to damp down such talk. Some insurers evenindicatedthat the White House called and asked them not to release any numbers in apparent effort to keep the enrollment failure off the front pages.The administration has put a private company in charge of fixing the problems with the website and has promised it will be up and running by November 30th. This date is already a full week past what some outside experts said was thedrop-dead datefor fixing the site, i.e. Thanksgiving. Assuming it is fixed by the end of the month that would leave just two weeks (until Dec. 15th) for people to sign up for coverage beginning January 1, 2014.Even more worrisome for the administration, there are some indications that the number of problems hampering the site is not decreasing yet.

And we will deliver free of charge 1.24 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines that have been produced in Japan.”Taiwan’s foreign ministry welcomed the move, pointedly emphasising that Taipei and Tokyo “share the universal values of freedom and democracy”.Its health minister Chen Shih-chung later confirmed the jabs had arrived.“This is the largest batch of vaccines we have received and I believe it will be very helpful for our overall pandemic prevention,” he said.Beijing accused Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of “placing political manipulations above people’s lives” by rejecting Chinese vaccines, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.President Tsai Ing-wen has accused China of having “interfered” with efforts to secure Pfizer doses, which are distributed in the Greater China region by a Shanghai-based pharmaceutical company.Tsai said in televised remarks that her government will keep negotiating with countries to ensure sufficient and steady vaccine supplies.“It’s not just us, all governments are fighting to get hold of vaccines. Due to Taiwan’s very difficult international situation, there could still be variables before the vaccines are being loaded onto an airplane.”Beijing has stepped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taipei since Tsai entered office five years ago, as she refuses to acknowledge its stance that the island is part of “one China”.Taiwan is currently locked out by China from the World Health Organization.The donation comes as Taiwan battles a sudden surge of cases, after having one of the world’s best pandemic responses.Infections have jumped in recent weeks to more than 10,000, with 187 deaths.Taiwan wants to roll out mass inoculations in the next few months by setting up thousands of community vaccination stations to administer one million shots weekly, but it is struggling to secure enough doses.The island of 23.5 million has pre-order deals for around 30 million shots, but had received just 726,600 AstraZeneca doses and 150,000 Moderna shots before the Japanese donation.Taiwan is also included in plans outlined by Washington this week to distribute 80 million doses globally."

But nestled between Serbia, Macedonia and Kosovo, the valley remains on edge, stricken by high unemployment and closely monitored by Serbian security services.Although there are no official figures, hundreds of soldiers and police operate in the valley.The big companies of the Yugoslav era have disappeared, such as plastics plant “July 7”, printing factory “Grafofleks”, trading firm “Buducnost” and a tobacco sorting plant.Unemployment is around 70 percent, official figures show.– Exodus –The dilapidated facades of Presevo testify to the misery. The average monthly salary reaches barely 100 euros ($117).In the valley’s other town, Bujanovac, where the Heba mineral water plant provides jobs, the average wage amounts to 200 euros — still only half Serbia’s national average.“Without the prospect of work, we will all end up leaving,” Jonuz Kamberi, a 24-year-old ethnic Albanian, told AFP.The unemployed metal worker had little to say about a territory swap.“Anyway, they will not ask me for my opinion,” he said.A territory swap would be “stupidity”, said Bratislav Trajkovic, a 64-year-old Serb from the multi-ethnic village of Reljan.“What we really need is work. And everyone (Serbs and Albanians) thinks the same,” said Trajkovic, a civil servant.Both sides are under pressure from Brussels to conclude a deal.Serbia is negotiating to join the European Union. Kosovo would like to open membership talks with the bloc and also join the United Nations.In another town, Slavujevac, all 500 inhabitants are Serbs.Fifty-five-year-old Stojan Nedeljkovic said he believed a new border line would “not solve any problems, neither for the Serbs nor for the Albanians”.The main concern is that people do not have the means to make a living, added Nedeljkovic, an unemployed father of five daughters.– Factory would change everything –“A factory would change everything,” said his friend, Nenad Djordjevic, a 55-year-old metal worker.But if nothing changes “all the children will leave”, added Djordjevic, who works at a factory operated by an ethnic Albanian.Out of 130 houses in Slavujevac, some 40 lie empty while others are mainly occupied by the elderly, he said.Armend Aliu, the 40-year-old ethnic Albanian deputy mayor of Presevo, said the Serbian state “ignored simple demands” such as an industrial zone to attract investors, a new border crossing with Macedonia and school books in Albanian.Belgrade’s inaction could boost nationalist aspirations, he said.But, national feeling hardly moves Fadil, an ethnic Albanian in his 60s, who came to Bujanovac for shopping.“My pension in Serbia is 300 euros and I was told that in Kosovo it would be around 50 euros,” said Fadil, who refused to give his family name.Some hundred kilometres to the northwest, in Kosovo, Nazmi Aliu, a retired 71-year-old firefighter, also feared moving the border would put him under Belgrade’s rule.Aliu lives in Suhodoll, an Albanian village in the north Mitrovica region.The predominantly Serbian enclave has one thing in common with Presevo: grinding poverty.“Large private sector investment is missing in the region,” according to a rare 2015 economic report by the Pristina-based institute RIINVEST.“Noteworthy assistance comes mainly from international donors and governmental agencies.”Adnan Jusufi, an unemployed 42-year-old, said a territorial exchange would make the situation worse.He doubts Serbia would show much concern for ethnic Albanians in northern Mitrovica.Albanians from northern Mitrovica “have no work, no schools” and depend on the “government’s care”, he said."

9319436262,https://www.breitbart.com/news/pfizer-seeks-ok-of-updated-covid-vaccine-booster-for-fall/,Pfizer seeks OK of updated COVID vaccine booster for fall,"Pfizer has asked U.S. regulators to authorize its combination COVID-19 vaccine that adds protection against the newest omicron relativesPfizer seeks OK of updated COVID vaccine booster for fallBy LAURAN NEERGAARDAP Medical WriterThe Associated PressPfizer asked U.S. regulators Monday to authorize its combination COVID-19 vaccine that adds protection against the newest omicron relatives — a key step toward opening a fall booster campaign.The Food and Drug Administration ordered vaccine makers to tweak their shotsto target BA.4 and BA.5 that are better than ever at dodging immunity from earlier vaccination or infection.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech aim to offer updated boosters to people 12 and older, and shots could begin within weeks if the FDA quickly clears the modified vaccine — a step not expected to require waiting on new studies.Moderna is expected to file a similar application soon for updated boosters for adults. The U.S. has a contract to buy 105 million of the Pfizer doses and 66 million Moderna ones, assuming FDA gives the green light.“It’s going to be really important that people this fall and winter get the new shots. It’s designed for the virus that’s out there,” White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said last week.For now at least. BA.5 currently is causing nearly all COVID-19 infections in the U.S. and much of the world. There’s no way to know if it still will be a threat this winter — or if another mutant will have replaced it.The vaccines currently used in the U.S. still offer strong protection against severe disease and death, especially if people have gotten their recommended boosters. But those vaccines target the coronavirus strain that spread in early 2020 and their effectiveness against infection has dropped markedly as new mutants came along, particularly the super-contagious omicron family.How would combo shots work? Sort of like a second-generation vaccine. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain the genetic instructions for the spike protein that coats the coronavirus, to train the immune system to recognize the real virus. The new combo doses will contain instructions for both the original spike target and the spike mutations carried by BA.4 and BA.5.The news comes after Britain a week agobecame the first in the world to authorize a different update to Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines — shots that add protection against the original omicron that struck last winter.European regulators also are considering the original omicron versions by Moderna and Pfizer. The U.S. opted not to use that earlier tweak — setting up a fall where different countries will be using different versions of booster shots to rev up protection against another possible winter surge.In the U.S., the FDA will be relying heavily on scientific testing of prior tweaks to the vaccine recipe — rather than a study of the newest boosters that could take months — to decide whether to fast-track updated shots for fall.Pfizer previously announced results from a study that found its earlier omicron tweak significantly revved up antibodies capable of fighting the first omicron version, called BA.1, and to a lesser degree the genetically distinct BA.4 and BA.5 omicron relatives. Its application to the FDA contains that data plus animal testing of the newest recipe update.It’s similar to how flu vaccines are updated every year without having to undergo large studies.Pfizer and BioNTech expect to start a trial using the BA.4 and BA.5 boosters in the coming weeks, to shed additional light on how well tweaked shots work. Moderna has begun a similar study although full results wouldn’t be available before a fall booster campaign.“It’s clear that none of these vaccines are going to completely prevent infection,” said Dr. Rachel Presti of Washington University in St. Louis, a researcher with the Moderna trial.But prior studies of variant booster candidates show “you still get a broader immune response giving a variant booster than giving the same booster” again, which should be helpful even if a newer omicron relative emerges, she added.Pfizer and Moderna don’t make the only U.S. vaccine options. Novavax makes a more traditional, protein-based shot — and U.S. health authorities just expanded its use for people as young as 12. Novavax also plans to offer a variant update later in the year.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

4631969284,http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/03/buchanan-attacking-trump-for-short-run-gains-may-terminate-the-political-career-of-rubio/,Buchanan: Attacking Trump for ‘Short Run’ Gains ‘May Terminate the Political Career’ of Rubio,"Wednesday on the Fox News Channel, conservative commentator expressed his skepticism of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a candidate for the 2016 GOP nomination, for his aggressive attacks on party front-runner Donald Trump.In an interview with “Hannity” host Sean Hannity, Buchanan argued that while this may win Rubio short-term successes with the media and political establishment, in the long run, it will hurt his political career.Partial transcript as follows:HANNITY: So are Rubio’s attacks turning into a suicide mission? And could it actually ruin his career and destroy and hurt the Republican Party? Here to answer that question, author of the book “The Greatest Comeback,” the original insurgent himself, Patrick J. Buchanan.Sir, how are you?PAT BUCHANAN, “THE GREATEST COMEBACK” AUTHOR: Doing fine, Sean.HANNITY: So I watched Marco in two interviews last night. And I want to be very clear here. For the record, I’ve always liked him. It’s very hard not to like Marco Rubio.I get the sense that he couldn’t get out the word “con artist,” “fraud,” supporting the KKK, hiring illegal immigrants, Trump University over and over enough, probably a preview of tomorrow’s debate. Here’s my question. Do you agree with me that probably this is — that this is not Marco we’ve known, and B, that he’s probably being influenced and he’s the hired gun now to take out the insurgency?BUCHANAN: I think he’s made a calculated decision that he’s going to be the — he’s getting the applause of the media establishment. He’s getting the applause of the establishment. He’s tearing down Donald Trump. The establishment wants him destroyed. Marco has volunteered to be the instrument of destruction.I agree with you in the longer run, Marco is not going to be the nominee. I don’t think the Trump people at the convention would ever support Marco Rubio after these kinds of attacks. But in the short run, Sean,there’s no doubt about it. It is an effective tactic. It’s got Marco tremendous amounts of attention he never otherwise got.Let me just tell you about the strategy they had in Virginia. They ran all these savage attack ads on Trump again and again and again. That’s where I live. Marco is calling him a scam artist, a con artist. And Marco closed the gap there. That’s the strategy between now and the ides of March.HANNITY: OK. But if you look, Pat, you know, he got the votes — most of his votes in northern Virginia. That is not an area where any Republican is going to really do well on — in the general election, same in Minnesota. I mean, he’s looking in Minneapolis/St. Paul, not exactly Republican-friendly territory here.So what is his goal here? In other words, is his goal…BUCHANAN: This is not…HANNITY: … to win or is his goal to prevent Trump or Cruz from getting 1,237 delegates?BUCHANAN: His goal — this is not a — you’re right. This is not a general election strategy. It’s not even a good nomination strategy. But it is a good strategy if the objective of you and your supporters is to bring down Trump, no matter how you have to do it, because we can’t accept him. And there’s a lot in the media, there are a lot here in the establishment in Washington, there are a lot of folks in the party who would be delighted to see Donald Trump taken down.HANNITY: But that’s what — and you don’t think there’s been back door meetings and closed door meetings and smoke-filled rooms and he’s not and he’s not getting support and being offered money to do all this? Maybe it’s my conspiratorial mind. I think this is orchestrated, well funded and well organized.BUCHANAN: Right. I think this helps Marco in the short run. In the long run, I agree with you. I think it may terminate the political career. And what I don’t understand is if they manage to destroy Donald Trump, who do they think’s going to get the nomination, Marco?HANNITY: Ted Cruz.BUCHANAN: Well, the likelihood is Ted Cruz, and the establishment doesn’t like him anymore than…HANNITY: They hate him, too.BUCHANAN: … they like…(CROSSTALK)HANNITY: They hate them both, and they hate you, also, Pat.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter@jeff_poor"

The company maintains a job listing on Indeed.com for its Zacatecas, Mexico plant that pays employees the equivalent of “$260 a month for a 50-hour per week job.”While serving as President and CEO of The Education Fund in 2018, Gupta made a moral case to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.“Raising wages is a moral question: do we value the people who are the engine of our economy or not? The answer must be yes,” she said.“The majority of people who would benefit from the policy changes we recommend are women, especially women of color, who are overrepresented in the low-wage workforce,” Gupta continued. “The first-hand stories in this report capture the day-to-day struggles of minimum wage life while underscoring the importance of providing better opportunities for low-income communities.”Aptiv’s business priorities seem to fail the nominee’s own example of paying “women of color” an honest wage. According to the report, “Other positions currently advertised by the company include a full-time general operator job thatpays$290 a month and a production line operator position thatpays$274 a month.”In addition to compensating its Mexican labor force below what Gupta believes is a “livable wage,” the corporation alsoadvertises“a major manufacturing base and strong customer relationships” in China, according to SECfilings. The SEC filings also reveal Gupta’s family companypaida “3 percent effective tax rate last year.”Former President Trump signed legislation that marked thecurrentcorporate tax rate at 21 percent by comparison.As the Senate is scheduled to vote on Gupta’s nomination Thursday morning, reactions to the news rocked Twitter. Arthur Schwartz, the composer and film producer, said, “Whether it’s Believe All Women!™ or Fight for Fifteen!, you’ll always find a hypocrite hiding behind the slogan.”Breitbart NewsreportedMarch 11 that Vanita Gupta also owns between $11 million and $55 million of stock in her father’s company which sold acetic anhydride to Mexican cartels, a chemical used to make “high-grade ‘china white’ heroin and methamphetamine.” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) hassubmittedquestions for the record to Gupta regarding her stake in the enterprise."
918039926,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA2DE1480,Pot votes in 2 states challenge US drug war,"(AP) Pot votes in 2 states challenge US drug warBy KRISTEN WYATTAssociated PressDENVERFirst came marijuana as medicine. Now comes legal pot for the people.Those who have argued for decades that legalizing and taxing weed would be better than a costly, failed U.S. drug war have their chance to prove it, as Colorado and Washington became the first states to allow pot for recreational use.While the measures earned support from broad swaths of the electorate in both states Tuesday, they are likely to face resistance from federal drug warriors. As of Wednesday, authorities did not say whether they would challenge the new laws.Pot advocates say a fight is exactly what they want.“I think we are at a tipping point on marijuana policy,” said Brian Vicente, co-author of Colorado’s marijuana measure. “We are going to see whether marijuana prohibition survives, or whether we should try a new and more sensible approach.”Soon after the measures passed, cheering people poured out of bars in Denver, the tangy scent of pot filling the air, and others in Seattle lit up in celebration.Authorities in Colorado, however, urged caution. “Federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don’t break out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly,” said Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who opposed the measure.As the initial celebration dies down and the process to implement the laws progresses over the next year, other states and countries will be watching to see if the measures can both help reduce money going to drug cartels and raise it for governments.Governments in Latin America where drugs are produced for the U.S. market were largely quiet about the measures, but the main adviser to Mexico’s president-elect said the new laws will force the U.S. and his country to reassess how they fight cross-border pot smuggling.Analysts said that there would likely be an impact on cartels in Mexico that send pot to the U.S., but differed on how soon and how much.Both measures call for the drug to be heavily taxed, with the profits headed to state coffers. Colorado would devote the potential tax revenue first to school construction, while Washington’s sends pot taxes to an array of health programs.Estimates vary widely on how much they would raise. Colorado officials anticipate somewhere between $5 million and $22 million a year. Washington analysts estimated legal pot could produce nearly $2 billion over five years.Both state estimates came with big caveats: The current illegal marijuana market is hard to gauge and any revenue would be contingent upon federal authorities allowing commercial pot sales in the first place, something that is very much still in question.Both measures remove criminal penalties for adults over 21 possessing small amounts of the drug _ the boldest rejection of pot prohibition laws passed across the country in the 1930s.Pot has come a long way since. In the 1960s, it was a counterculture fixture. In 1971, President Richard Nixon declared the War on Drugs. Twenty-five years later, California approved medical marijuana. Now, 17 states and Washington, D.C., allow it.Meanwhile, many more cities either took pot possession crimes off the books or directed officers to make marijuana arrests a low priority.On Tuesday night, broad sections of the electorate in Colorado and Washington backed the measures, some because they thought the drug war had failed and others because they viewed potential revenue as a boon for their states in lean times.“People think little old ladies with glaucoma should be able to use marijuana. This is different. This is a step further than anything we have seen to date,” said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor who has studied the history of pot prohibition.The Justice Department says it is evaluating the measures. When California was considering legalization in 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder said it would be a “significant impediment” to joint federal and local efforts to combat drug traffickers.Federal agents have cracked down on medical pot dispensaries in states where it is legal, including California and Washington. Individual pot users may not be immediately impacted, as authorities have long focused on dismantling trafficking operations.Peter Bensinger, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration from 1976 to 1981, and other former DEA heads urged Holder to make more noise this year about the pot votes. Colorado was a critical state for President Barack Obama’s re-election.Now, he said, “I can’t see the Justice Department doing anything other than enforce the law. There’s no other out.”Brian Smith of the Washington State Liquor Control Board, which will implement the new law, said officials are waiting anxiously to find out what federal law enforcement authorities plan to do. “They have been silent,” Smith said.Both states will have about a year to come up with rules for their legal pot systems.In Mexico, which produces much of the pot that gets into the U.S. and where cartels and the government are embroiled in a yearslong deadly battle, the man in charge of Enrique Pena Nieto’s presidential transition said the administration opposed legalization.“These important modifications change somewhat the rules of the games in the relationship with the United States,” Luis Videgaray told Radio Formula.A former high-ranking official in the country’s internal intelligence service who has studied the potential effects of legalization said he was optimistic that the measures would damage the cartels, possibly cutting profits from $6 billion to $4.6 billion.Alejandro Hope, now an analyst at the think tank Mexican Competitiveness Institute, said among the complicating factors could be whether a strong U.S. crackdown on legal pot could negate all but the smallest effects on the cartels.In Seattle, John Davis, a medical marijuana provider, called passage of the state’s measure “a significant movement in the right direction.” But he said he expected some confrontation with federal authorities.“This law does not prevent conflicts,” he said, adding that its passage “will highlight the necessity to find some kind of resolution between state and federal laws.”___Associated Press reporters Nicholas K.

4981498692,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/07/12/obama-administration-claims-islamic-state-twitter-traffic-45/,Report: Islamic State Twitter Traffic Down 45% as Encrypted App Popularity Rises,"It’s a sign of our curious times that the Obama administration is touting how much ground ISIS has lost on Twitter.The Islamic State’s social media operation is often credited for their success at recruiting both foot soldiers in the Middle East and “lone wolf” jihadis around the world, so a dramatic reduction of their online footprint would be good news, if that is indeed what’s happening.TheAssociated Pressrelays administration reports that ISIS Twitter traffic has “plunged 45 percent in the past two years,” allegedly thanks to American and allied efforts to “counter messages of jihadi glorification with a flood of online images and statements about suffering and enslavement at the hands of the extremist organization.”The AP describes some of those counter-jihad online images:A teddy bear with Arabic writing and messages saying ISIS “slaughters childhood,” “kills innocence,” “lashes purity” or “humiliates children.” A male hand covering a female’s mouth, saying ISIS “deprives woman her voice.” A woman in a black niqab (veil), bloody tears coming from a bruised eye, and the caption: “Women under ISIS. Enslaved. Battered. Beaten. Humiliated. Flogged.”Some of that sounds suspiciously similar topro-ISIS online propaganda, but credit is also given to the growing sophistication of the counter-jihad media campaign, which is now better at writing messages in Arabic instead of English, using credible third parties to disseminate its messages, and studying how ISIS recruits new members.The follower counts for pro-ISIS Twitter accounts have declined steeply, and a growing number of those accounts have been banned by Twitter administrators. Anti-Islamic State online content is now said to outweigh pro-ISIS messages by a factor of 6 to 1.“The U.S. messages attempt to undermine many of ISIS’ most oft-cited claims. These include the group’s supposed invincibility on the battlefield or that its caliphate is good for Muslims. American partners have flooded social media with messages highlighting the group’s territorial loses and inability to effectively govern or provide basic services to areas under its control,” writes the Associated Press.C/NETalso gives some credit to private-sector crackdowns on terrorist chatter, including Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and YouTube signing on to the European Union’s new rules against “hate speech and terrorist propaganda.”Engadgetspeculates that the Islamic State’s defeats on the battlefield might have played a role in reducing its online presence as its reputation for savage invincibility is shattered, causing online fans to become disillusioned.TheWashington Postmentions another energetic private campaign against ISIS online: hackers with the “Anonymous” group have been waging war against the Islamic State. In the wake of the Orlando massacre, the hackers kicked things up a notch by spamming hundreds of ISIS Twitter accounts with pornography.The hacker spearheading this effort, “Wauchula Ghost,” was not terribly impressed with the official government campaign against ISIS online. “The government really hasn’t been doing enough, especially on social media. You see beheading images everywhere. Kids get online and shouldn’t see these images,” he told theWashington Post,without delving into the relative merits of showing those kids pornography instead.According to Wauchula Ghost, the salutary effect of the porn spam is that it drives Islamic fundamentalists away from the hacked accountsand sometimes prompts Twitter administrators to shut the accounts down for good.The Associated Press report on declining Twitter traffic for ISIS does not mention the possibility that users are moving to other platforms, particularly secure messaging applications like Telegram.Such platforms wouldn’t have as broad an appeal as highly accessible mainstream services like Twitter or Facebook, but it’s hard to say whether “casual” consumers of Islamic State propaganda are integral to its success. We really need to know more about the 45 percent of followers who have reputedly drifted away from online extremism and about the 55 percent who remain."

It is the cross. It is ordered in Sharia that you should break it and eliminate it,” he said.Taliban authorities have not imposed any dress rules on men since taking over in August 2021, but women must cover up with a hijab when out in public.Afghan Taliban officials almost all dress the same — shalwar kameez, a waistcoat, and turban.Casual Western clothes became less common after the Taliban takeover but some professionals — as well as newsreaders on TV channels — still don a collar and tie.The tie is widely believed to have emerged in the 17th century and was made a fashion staple by the French.Previous Afghan administrations have also tried to impose dress regulations on the population, or on officials at least.During the decade-long Soviet occupation starting in 1979, government workers were discouraged from wearing traditional attire and told to wear suits.Former president Ashraf Ghani — who fled the country as the Taliban took over in 2021 — favoured Western suits when abroad and traditional attire at home.During their two-decade insurgency the Taliban’s fighters wore shalwar kameez, but since taking power have introduced modern military uniforms for the armed services."
2492980281,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/03/23/Obamacare-Anniversary-Are-You-and-the-Constitution-Better-Off-than-Four-Years-Ago,Obamacare Anniversary: Are You (and the Constitution) Better Off than Four Years Ago?,"Today marks four years since President Barack Obama signed Obamacare into law. Although the impact on healthcare has been extensive, what he’s done since that day implicates every area of government and our national life. It’s time to shift our focus from rhetoric to results, and ask Ronald Reagan’s immortal question: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? And is the Constitution?Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law on Mar. 23, 2010. It is 2,700 pages long, authorizes tens of thousands of pages worth of regulations that carry the force of law (with countless more coming), and effectuates a massive overhaul of one sixth of the U.S. economy. Its twin goals–as found in Section 1501 of the statute–are to ensure “near-universal” healthcare coverage and to lower costs. The president has repeatedly claimed it would reduce average family costs by $2,500 per year.First, the facts today. As the first person actually to live in the White House, John Adams, once said, “Facts are stubborn things.” And they tell a story that’s markedly different from the story we get from the current occupant of the White House.Most of Obamacare’s major provisions went into effect on Jan. 1, 2014, so we’re only now starting to see the wide-ranging impact of this statute. First, the costs. When the ACA was enacted, healthcare was just over $2.6 trillion per year. Now it’s over $2.8 trillion, an increase of four percent. Even with U.S. population growth of nine million in the past two years, that’s an increase of $500 to $8,900 per person–which comes to over $22,000 for an average family. That’s an increase, not a $2,500 decrease.Then there is the number of uninsured. There are perhaps 35 million uninsured Americans. (Some say 50 million; they are rounding up the number 47 million, which includes at least twelve million illegal aliens. When specifically referring to the number of uninsured citizens, it’s 35 million.) Studies show approximately nine million of those have always been eligible for Medicaid and have never signed up, and most of the remaining millions either lack insurance for 90 days or less as they transition to a new job or new plan, or make over $80,000 a year and choose not to get insurance. The number of long-term uninsured who cannot obtain insurance is five to ten million.There are conflicting reports on the enrollment numbers under Obamacare. It seems millions of sign-ups have been for Medicaid, and the number includes those who normally sign up at the same rate as before the ACA. Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services have issued reliable numbers about how many are signing up because of Obamacare. Also, since Medicaid is a government healthcare program paid for by all taxpayers, those enrollees draw resources out of the national healthcare system; they don’t reflect anyone who’s actually paying money into the system.Further, we haven’t been given reliable numbers on (1) how many people have purchased health insurance or (2) how many of those people have paid their premiums. We have been told that (3) only about 25 percent of those people are younger people, which is an enormous problem, because even the ACA’s supporters admit that 40 percent or so of those who join must be young and healthy in order for the system to have enough money to stay afloat. And even that 40 percent figure is wildly optimistic.The lack of hard numbers suggests that the emerging facts are very troublesome for the administration. We have no choice but to wait a few more months until those numbers are confirmed before reaching conclusions.One thing that is clear is that many of the newer policies have much higher deductibles–such as $5,000 for an individual or $12,000 for a family–before enrollees start receiving major benefits. Those policies are no better than catastrophic coverage; the average family cannot afford that kind of massive out-of-pocket cost, nor will they consume that much in healthcare in any given year. And their monthly premiums are increasing at an alarming rate. Calling those people “insured” to subtract them from the 35 million is grossly misleading–a politician’s spin with semantic head-fakes, not any meaningful benefit to the American people.That’s just in the first three months of the ACA’s being fully in effect. Then the White House used a reporting gimmick so that the new, higher premiums for many people will not be announced until this November–after the midterm elections. Expect massive sticker shock, with numbers far higher than are being admitted now.The net result should be unavoidable. Costs will increase, and consequently the number of people without meaningful insurance will grow. The ACA will fail in both of its stated goals (near-universal coverage and decreased costs).Then we have the implementation. The president has unilaterally refused to implement over 30 of the provisions in the ACA. Obamacare has 450 sections, some of which give discretion to the executive branch in terms of how to implement. But the provisions Obama has refused to put into effect–such as the employer mandate for one year, or the IRS corporate reporting system for one year, or suspending provisions on essential benefits to be included in every insurance policy–are all mandatory provisions of the law. Only Congress can make those changes. If the president does it, he’s breaking the law.This is where the conversation shifts from healthcare to the Constitution. Ignoring provisions of federal law has become an alarming trend of this president. He has likewise refused to enforce certain provisions of federal laws regarding immigration, drugs, campaign finance, and racial discrimination, when they conflict with his political agenda. He refused to defend the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act in court for the same reason.And he violated the Recess Appointments Clause of the Constitution by declaring the U.S. Senate to be in recess when it was actually in session, filling several top government posts with nominees that the Senate refused to confirm. (Breitbart Newsreportedon this case when it was argued before the Supreme Court on Jan. 13, 2014. The Court seems poised to strike down these appointments and rebuke the president. A decision is expected by June.)As I explain with my coauthor in a scholarly legal work that will be in print this April in theHarvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, the Take Care Clause was specifically inserted into Article II of the Constitution to guarantee that no president could ever ignore the words of the Constitution or of federal law. Breitbart News haspreviously reportedon why Obama’s actions are unconstitutional, and how the mediais coveringfor him.Speaking about Obamacare at CPAC earlier this month, national conservative leader Ken Blackwell posited that the root problem with the ACA is that it embodies a belief in the role of government vis-à-vis the American people that conflicts with the vision of the Founding Fathers, reflected both in the Declaration of Independence and then later in the Constitution.Our national philosophy “celebrates the primacy of the individual and the supremacy of God,” in contrast to the Far Left’s ideology, which asserts the “primacy of the collective good” and the “supremacy of the central government,” Blackwelltoldthe assembled crowd. “Our fundamental rights are gifts from God, not grants from government,” Blackwell declared.Obamacare went before the Supreme Court in 2012. Part of it was invalidated for violating the Constitution’s Spending Clause. The ACA’s individual mandate was sustained by a 5-4 vote, in which Chief Justice Roberts wrote that it was unconstitutional as written (as a regulation of interstate commerce), but that he would vote to sustain it as an optional tax: you can either buy insurance, or pay a tax. Matt Drudge was completely accurate in calling this a “Liberty Tax” that Americans are paying right now.Looking at the big picture, all of this goes to American exceptionalism. What Blackwell described is part of what makes America an exceptional nation. American exceptionalism also arises from our Constitution’s system of the division of power between federal and state governments, the separation of powers between Congress, the president, and the courts, and the checks and balances that each branch has against the others.Obama has thrown into disarray these structural protections, which exist to safeguard the liberty of every American in every generation regardless of his political beliefs or personal circumstances. It also impacts our long-term prosperity, as a central aspect of why America is a great place to do business is that we are a nation under the rule of law. Obama’s illegal actions have undermined the stability of the rule of law, which will negatively impact our economy.America is at a fork in the road, and must make a decision as to the kind of nation we want to be, and what relationship we want between each individual and the federal government. So on Obamacare’s fourth anniversary, there’s a question worth asking, and publicly debating through the 2014 midterms and into the 2016 presidential election. Whether talking about healthcare or the nation as a whole: Are you and the Constitution better off than you were four years ago?Ken Klukowski is senior legal analyst for Breitbart News.

6731795623,http://www.breitbart.com/news/russia-impress-as-world-cup-kicks-off/,Russia impress as World Cup kicks off,"Moscow (AFP) – Russia kicked off their World Cup in style on Thursday, scoring early against Saudi Arabia in front of an ecstatic crowd in Moscow after President Vladimir Putin officially declared the tournament open.After a performance from British pop star Robbie Williams, Putin told the 80,000 crowd at the Luzhniki Stadium: “I congratulate all of you at the start of the most important championship in the world.”“Love for football unites the entire world in one team, regardless of people’s language or ideology,” Putin said to thunderous cheers from the capacity crowd.Then, to the delight of the home fans, Iury Gazinsky headed Russia in front in the 12th minute after a cross from Aleksandr Golovin. Substitute Denis Cheryshev rifled home a second goal shortly before half-time.Russia, ranked a lowly 70th in the world — three places below Saudi Arabia — know victory in their first match is vital, with tougher games against Egypt and Uruguay to come.Russia is spending more than $13 billion (11 billion euros) on hosting football’s showpiece, the most important event in the country since the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics.The buildup to the tournament has been dogged by controversy and diplomatic scandals and has shone a light on the challenges facing the country.On the day of the curtainraiser, Russia freed the main opposition figure to Putin, Alexei Navalny, from jail after he served a 30-day sentence for organising an illegal protest.But British gay rights activist Peter Tatchell was arrested for holding a one-man protest against the country’s record on gay rights, hours before kick-off.The World Cup favourites — Germany, Spain, France, Brazil — enter the fray from Friday onwards.Brazil and their superstar Neymar are seeking a sixth global crown while Germany, who won their fourth World Cup in Brazil four years ago, will be determined to draw level with the Brazilians.France boast possibly the most talented squad while Lionel Messi is desperate to make amends for Argentina’s defeat in the 2014 final.The preparations of 2010 winners Spain are in tatters after coach Julen Lopetegui was sacked just two days before their opening game on Friday against Portugal. He had angered his federation by taking the job of Real Madrid manager.Neymar, the world’s most expensive player, has recovered from a broken bone in his foot in time.Egypt’s coach said prolific striker Mohamed Salah is “almost 100 percent” to play in their opening match against Uruguay on Friday after he had intensive treatment on the shoulder injury he suffered playing for Liverpool against Real Madrid in the Champions League final.– Hearts and minds –The money lavished on the tournament will boost Putin’s already sky-high prestige at home by giving many of the 11 host cities their first facelifts in generations.Cities such as Saransk were sleepy outposts with decaying buildings until the World Cup reconstruction put them firmly in the 21st century.The tournament also offers Putin a chance to project Russia as a global player that is accepted and respected even while being at odds with the United States.He is attempting to do so despite Russia being hit by international sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014.Moscow’s military backing of the Syrian regime and alleged meddling in the 2016 US election on President Donald Trump’s behalf only deepened its worst rift with the West since the Cold War.Putin hopes the most-watched event on the planet provides Russia with the “soft power” needed to capture a sceptical world’s hearts and minds.– Racism and riots –Russian authorities have gone to great lengths to ensure nothing soils the country’s image.The bloody beating English fans took from nearly 200 Russian thugs at Euro 2016 in France has influenced preparations as much as any diplomatic dispute.Neo-Nazi hooligans who organise mass fights in forests and chant racist slurs at players have been a feature of Russian stadiums for years.The anti-discrimination network Fare said Russia’s football federation was making matters worse by punishing those who reacted to racist abuse “while ignoring the perpetrators”.Security services have either locked up or restricted the movements of hundreds to make sure they do nothing to tarnish Russia’s image."

She was herself intimidated and physically abused by security forces for making her forbidden recordings.“The government’s way of managing this city has just been intimidation and threats. This is truly the tragedy of this country,” she said in her last video report.This March 7, 2020, photo shows a medical staff member (C) holding a newborn in Xiehe hospital in Wuhan in China’s central Hubei province. (STR/AFP via Getty Images)In May 2020, the Chinese government “disappeared” Zhang. After seven months of arbitrary detention, they tried her on the all-purpose charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” andsentencedher to four years in prison in December 2020. She refused to plead guilty, which in China usually means a longer, harsher sentence.Zhang launched a hunger strike soon after her arrest. She appeared at her closed-door 2020 trial in a wheelchair and was barely able to speak, according to her lawyers. The lawyers also said Zhang’s captors have been force-feeding her through nasal tubes.Zhang’s mother toldRadio Free Asia(RFA) on Tuesday that she wept when she saw how much Zhang’s health had deteriorated during an October 28 video call.“She can’t walk unassisted now, and her head keeps drooping as she speaks. She will be in huge danger if they don’t release her on medical parole,” Zhang’s mother said.“Zhan is 177cm tall, now she has less than 40 kg wt. She may not survive the coming cold winter. I hope the world remembers how she used to be,” her brother Zhang Ju said on social media this week.“In her heart, it seems there is only God and her beliefs, with no care for anything else,” Jusaid.News of her physical condition prompted Amnesty International (AI) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) to demand Zhang’s immediate release.“Zhang Zhan, who should never have been jailed in the first place, now appears to be at grave risk of dying in prison,”saidAI’s Gwen Lee on Thursday. “The Chinese authorities must release her immediately so that she can end her hunger strike and receive the appropriate medical treatment she desperately needs.”“The Chinese government’s prosecution of Zhang Zhan, simply because she tried to uncover what was happening in Wuhan amid huge government secrecy about the pandemic, is a shameful attack on human rights,” Lee said.“Pending her release, she must have regular, unrestricted access to her family and lawyers of her choice, and not be subjected further to any ill-treatment. If Zhang Zhan dies in prison, her blood will be on the Chinese government’s hands,” she warned.AI added that reports Zhang was restrained for force-feeding, and shackled for over three months as punishment for her hunger strike, indicate clear human rights violations.“The Chinese government needs to be held to account for allowing yet another peaceful critic to fall gravely ill while unjustly imprisoned,”HRW’s senior China researcher Yaqiu Wangsaid. “Governments should call for Zhang Zhan’s urgent release to prevent an already terrible situation from becoming a tragic one.”“Unjust sentences handed down against activists in China frequently end up being death sentences,” Wang noted.“I think it would be very meaningful if we could save Zhang Zhan, because she will never give up her hunger strike while she’s in prison. In these very dark times, she won’t try to protect herself, she won’t compromise, and she won’t bow down to power,”Wang Jianhong of the U.S.-based Humanitarian China told RFA. “She has always been that way; she has always wanted to conquer fear.”A source close to the Zhangs toldAFPthe family asked for permission to meet with her at the Shanghai prison where she is held, but the Chinese government never responded to the request. The prison did not answer when AFP asked for comment.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbindismissedcalls for Zhang’s release as “anti-China political manipulation” on Friday.“China is a country with rule of law. Anyone who breaks the law must be punished in accordance with the law,” Wang stated."
4563609728,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/02/08/dhs-whistleblower-obama-administration-ordered-destruction-of-intelligence-needed-to-keep-americans-safe/,Whistleblower Claims Obama Admin Destroyed Intel ‘Needed to Keep Americans Safe’,"A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whistleblower accused the Obama administration of engaging in a “bureaucratic effort to destroy” intelligence records of hundreds of Muslims with ties to terrorism that are “needed to keep Americans safe.”Philip Haney, the former DHS employee turned whistleblower, added that the administration’s order to wipe out records of Muslim terrorists from travel and national security databases has made it “vastly more difficult” to prevent future attacks.He made those comments in an article he authored forThe Hill, detailing his experience at the federal anti-terror department, which he noted has been hindered by political correctness employed by the Obama administration.“We knew his administration had been engaged in a bureaucratic effort to destroy the raw material—the actual intelligence we had collected for years, and erase those dots,” he wrote. “The dots constitute the intelligence needed to keep Americans safe, and the Obama administration was ordering they be wiped away.”“After leaving my 15 year career at DHS, I can no longer be silent about the dangerous state of America’s counter-terror strategy, our leaders’ willingness to compromise the security of citizens for the ideological rigidity of political correctness—and, consequently, our vulnerability to devastating, mass-casualty attack,” he added.The whistleblower indicated that the Obama administration hindered the intelligence community’s ability to prevent Nigerian MuslimUmar Farouk Abdulmutallabfrom getting close to bombing Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day in 2009 with explosives he was carrying in his underwear, which malfunctioned, and brave passengers subdued him until his arrest.Prior to the attack, in early November 2009, Haney revealed that his superiors at DHS ordered him to wipe out or modify the intelligence records of individuals linked to jihadist groups that had been entered in a federal database known as theTreasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS).“These types of records are the basis for any ability to ‘connect dots.’  Every day, DHS Customs and Border Protection [CBP] officers watch entering and exiting many individuals associated with known terrorist affiliations, then look for patterns,” he explained. “Enforcing a political scrubbing of records of Muslims greatly affected our ability to do that. Even worse, going forward, my colleagues and I were prohibited from entering pertinent information into the database.”“A few weeks later, in my office at the Port of Atlanta, the television hummed with the inevitable Congressional hearings that follow any terrorist attack,” he added. “While members of Congress grilled Obama administration officials, demanding why their subordinates were still failing to understand the intelligence they had gathered, I was being forced to delete and scrub the records. And I was well aware that, as a result, it was going to be vastly more difficult to ‘connect the dots’ in the future—especially before an attack occurs.”He noted that President Obama’s comments condemning the intelligence community in the wake of the attempted Christmas Day bombing in 2009 made an “enormous damage” to morale at DHS.The president accused the intelligence community of failing to “connect the dots,” adding, “This was not a failure to collect intelligence, it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had.”The type of information that the Obama administration ordered destroyed could have prevented subsequent Islamist terrorist attacks carried out or attempted on the homeland, according to the whistleblower.Such attacks include the ones carried by the perpetrator behind the foiled Time Square bombing attempt,Faisal Shahzad (May 2010); Detroit “honor killing” perpetratorRahim A. Alfetlawi (2011);Amine El Khalifi, who plotted to blow up the U.S. Capitol (2012);Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev,who conducted the Boston Marathon bombing (2013); Oklahoma beheading suspectAlton Nolen(2014); orMuhammed Yusuf Abdulazeez, who opened fire on two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, (2015),” he wrote.Haney, in an interview with “Breitbart News Daily,” also accused the Obama administration of shutting down an investigation that may have prevented the December 2015 San Bernardino, California, massacre because they wanted to protect the “civil liberties” of jihadist supporters.The former DHS employee added that the administration has prevented DHS from trackingTablighi Jamaat (TJ), an Islamist movement whose members have been linked to various terrorist groups including al-Qaeda. TJ has strong presence in the United States, according to Haney and the FBI.Haney was a founding member of thePassenger Analysis Unit (PAU)under CBP, which is charged with “vetting, investigating, finding addresses, making connections, and putting the dots together” on persons entering the United States who may be security threats. He spent his final days at CBP, a component of DHS, working as a subject matter expert (Islamist terrorism) for the agency’sNational Targeting Center."

Weinstein expressed concern over the way the Council was formed, mainly that it was designed without an opportunity for a large chunk of faculty to voice their own opinions.“Professor Bret Weinstein objected to the lack of discussion, and carefully acknowledged the danger of challenging the wisdom of such a resolution in the current climate,” Weinstein’s lawyers wrote in a document included in the suit.Weinstein also explained that opposing a proposal centered on the concept of “equity” put its detractors at risk of being labeled a bigot by faculty. According to the document, Weinstein “went on to explain that he was afraid that speaking against an ‘equity’ resolution might result in others portraying him as a white person self-servingly acting to protect unearned privilege.”A central figure at Evergreen that stood in opposition to Weinstein was Professor Naomi Lowe. “If you think faculty autonomy is being targeted, you’re right,” Lowe allegedly told Weinstein, according to an exchange described in one of the documents in the suit. “I am sick and tired of asking our students of color to articulate the experiences of racism that they have faced. We have an obligation to simply accept what they say.”On April 12, Evergreen held its Day of Absence event as scheduled. After news of Weinstein’s opposition to the event spread around campus, tensions heightened and a group of 50 angry students stormed Weinstein’s classroom on the morning of May 23, demanding his resignation.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTNoFGIRt1M"
8130099934,https://www.breitbart.com/news/us-housing-starts-jump-17-3-in-june-government/,US housing starts jump 17.3% in June: government,"Washington (AFP) – US home construction surged 17.3 percent in June, the Commerce Department said Friday, as the sector continued to gain ground following the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The rebound in housing starts compared to May saw the northeast — home to the worst initial outbreak of COVID-19 — spike 114.3 percent and the midwest and south also grow, though starts were down 7.5 percent in the west.Construction was at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.186 million, above analysts’ forecasts, however it was down 4.0 percent from June 2019, according to the monthly data report.The sector had started recovering in May after a steep decline in April, the first full month of business shutdowns to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Growth in June was seen both in single-family housing starts, which were up 17.2 percent, and in units of five or more, which rose 18.6 percent.Permits, a sign of demand in the pipeline, grew 2.1 percent from May fueled by single-family authorizations, which rose 11.8 percent while multi-unit permits decline.However, the number was 2.5 percent below the same month in 2019.The data “is only a bare, partial recovery,” chief economist of the National Association of Realtors Lawrence Yun said in statement, adding that the United States needs at least 1.5 million new units to satisfy increased demand.“The housing market is hot. Homebuyers have swiftly moved into the market to take advantage of the unimaginably low mortgage rates. But inventory is lacking with a sizable backlog of buyers getting outbid by others,” Yun said.However Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics noted the average for both starts and permits was weaker in the first quarter than the second.“Beyond a near-term bounce that reflects demand for more space as more and more people work from home, a desire to live in less densely populated areas as well as low mortgage rates, the outlook for housing is likely weak as job and income losses curtail activity,” she said in a note."

5768377566,http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2017/04/28/john-bolton-if-north-korea-gets-nuclear-missiles-iran-could-have-that-capability-the-next-day-by-writing-a-check/,"John Bolton: If North Korea Gets Nuclear Missiles, ‘Iran Could Have That Capability the Next Day by Writing a Check’","On Friday’sBreitbart News Daily,former U.N. ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow for a look at President Trump’s first hundred days from a foreign policy and national security perspective.Bolton said Trump’s record has been “mixed, depending on what area of the world, what particular crisis you look at, and really what point during the hundred days that you take.”“I think in many respects the campaign rhetoric – which was very, very tough on things like the Iran nuclear deal and the North Korean nuclear threat, much of which continued into the first hundred days – is very much at risk of being subverted by the bureaucracy that the administration has not yet tamed,” he cautioned.“There’s a significant risk that both because of some of the appointees that the president has named, and the appointees hehasn’tnamed – the people in the lower ranks who are the president’s eyes and ears and implementers out in the bureaucracy, particularly at the State Department, which is expert at capturing political appointees, especially from Republican administrations. If the president’s not careful, he will see his foreign policy – despite what I think his own views are – captured by the same bureaucracy that for eight years implemented the Obama foreign policy,” he elaborated.“That’s the danger that I see. I don’t think the president has moved on some of these key national security issues as far as the press would like you to believe, or as far as the bureaucracy would like you to believe. It remains to be seen how many people in the administration can remember what they said during the campaign on some of these issues,  particularly terrorism and nuclear proliferation, as the bureaucracy nibbles away at them,” said Bolton.“I think the president needs to be more of a disciplinarian with his subordinates and their bureaucracy,” he advised.“I think that may be contrary to his natural instincts. I think he is an open, optimistic kind of man, and I think in the Trump Organization it was small enough that that kind of approach worked. But in the sprawling federal government, where different departments and agencies have their own cultures and their own agendas, especially in national security where they’re not friendly to Republican administrations, he needs to be tougher out there. I’m worried about what we’re going to do on Iran. I’m worried about what we’re going to do on North Korea,” Bolton said.He warned there is “a whole range of issues where there is a real risk of creeping back to the Obama administration policy – as the poem goes, ‘not with a bang but with a whimper.’”“Now, in other areas, I think he’s pretty much holding the line, which is why I say overall I think the performance in the first hundred days is mixed,” Bolton concluded.Focusing on the Iran nuclear deal, Bolton recalled the State Department’s letter to Congress last week which “certified that Iran was in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal.”“That is simply not true, in terms of their refusal to let the International Atomic Energy Agency visit key military sites, their excessive production of heavy water, their excessive enrichment of uranium, their gross disregard of the Security Council resolution and the part of the agreement dealing with ballistic missiles,” he asserted. “And those are just some of the things we know publicly. These are plain violations of the agreement. And that doesn’t count the provisions of the agreement that are so ambiguous, so poorly drafted, so open to interpretations favorable to Iran that lawyers could end up debating them for decades into the future.”“What’s even worse is, if you read the congressional statute carefully, the reporting obligation does not require the president to make a binary decision – yes Iran is in compliance, or no Iran is not in compliance. By the statute’s own terms, it allows the president to say, ‘I am not able to certify that Iran is in compliance,’ which he would have been perfectly legitimate within his rights to do, especially given the newness of the administration,” he noted.“Now, where did that certification come from? It came from the State Department bureaucracy. It came from the same people who negotiated the deal that was finally agreed to in the summer of 2015, and who have been protecting it, nurturing it, sheltering it for a year and a half since then. This may sound like a small point, but I’ll tell you, the proponents of the deal have taken that certification in just one week and said, ‘See, even the Trump administration says that the good old ayatollahs in Iran are complying with the deal,’” Bolton said.“The negative implication of that, as the Trump administration then goes on to say Iran’s behavior in most material respects, as the president himself said, violates the spirit of the deal. Well, it goes beyond that. It violates the letter of the deal as well,” he contended.“I’ve heard different stories, frankly, about whether the White House cleared that document or not, or whether – as is often the case with the bureaucracy – they come running in and say, ‘This is due on Capitol Hill at 5 P.M.! We’ve got to send it! We’ve got to send it, or we’ll be in default, we’ll be delinquent, we’ll be subject to criticism!’ So people say well, all right, I guess we’ve got to send it, and they don’t have time to think through the implications,” he said.“This is to me a kind of textbook example, in the case of Iran, how a very strong and pro-American foreign policy just gets whittled away. It may seem like water eroding rock. It doesn’t happen in dramatic moments. But I’m just telling you, this is the way bureaucracy works, and it works to undercut especially conservative and Republican presidents,” Bolton lamented.Breitbart News National Security Editor Frances Martel joined the conversation to ask Bolton about the deep relationship between the nuclear issues in Iran and North Korea, which are generally treated as entirely separate matters in media coverage.“The media don’t get the connection, and that in part is because the national security bureaucracy doesn’t get, or doesn’t want to talk about, the connection,” Bolton replied, portraying it as “a classic bureaucratic example of what they call silos.”“You’ve got the people dealing with Iran there in one silo, you’ve got the people dealing with North Korea in another silo. They might as well be on different planets,” he explained.“But the fact is, again, from publicly available information going back 30 years, we know that the North Koreans and the Iranians have been in close cooperation on the development of ballistic missiles for that entire period. North Korea sold Iran the first SCUD missiles that were the basis for the Iranian missile program. They’ve cooperated in multiple ways since then. It makes perfectly good sense for that to happen. They’re both using the same Soviet-era SCUD missile technology for their missile programs, so they’ve got a common scientific and engineering base. Their objectives for the missile programs are exactly the same. It’s to deliver nuclear weapons, not launch communications or weather satellites. On that score, it’s just absolutely clear,” Bolton said.“It is less clear in terms of publicly available evidence on the nuclear side, but I think there is substantial reason to believe there’s close cooperation there as well,” he continued. “The reactor that Israel destroyed in Syria in September of 2007 was being built by North Koreans. It was a clone of the North Korean Yongbyon reactor. Most people don’t think Syria had the financial wherewithal to pay for building that kind of reactor, and the North Koreans don’t do anything for free, so where did the money come from? I think it probably came from Iran.”“I think there are a lot of other connections that have been noted, the Iranian scientists in North Korea and vice versa. Forget the Iran nuclear deal for a minute – it’s entirely foreseeable that the day North Korea gets the capability to drop a nuclear warhead on the United States via ballistic missile, Iran could have that capability the next day by writing a check in the right amount of money, so this relationship is extremely important,” he warned.“On North Korea itself, the administration started off again with a very tough line on this – and yet yesterday, in an interview with Fox News, Secretary Tillerson said he’d be willing to have bilateral discussions with North Korea. This is after saying that the Obama ‘strategic patience’ doctrine was being rejected, after saying correctly we’ve negotiated with North Korea for 25 years and it hasn’t produced anything. Now we’re back to negotiating with North Korea and pressuring China to pressure North Korea. This is like Year 26 of the same failed policy,” Bolton complained.“Now, I don’t want to overstate that, the secretary might have misstated what he implied by that, and certainly China has done a few things in the past couple of weeks that look encouraging. But I’ve been around that track before. When the heat gets too great, the Chinese pat the North Koreans on the fanny and say, ‘bad boys!’ They take some steps that appear to put pressure on North Korea, and then they hope that Americans with our famously short attention spans turn away, and the heat goes off, and then they quietly go back to business as before the particular crisis,” he said.Bolton urged policymakers to remember that North Korea sees nuclear weapons as a tool for implementing a dangerous long-term policy agenda, which they would not abandon even if their nuclear aspirations were decisively thwarted.“I think the same is true for the ayatollahs in Iran,” he added. “So when you say to Kim Jong-un and his generals, ‘Give up your nuclear weapons,’ what they hear is ‘give up up your regime, and maybe give up your lives, while we’re on the subject.’ They’re not going to do it.”“We have tried diplomacy, persuasion. We have tried sanctions, coercion, in differing measures, different combinations, for 26 years. It just hasn’t worked,” he said.“That’s why I think the only long-term solution is reunifying the two Koreas,” Bolton offered. “I think we could explain to China why that’s in their best interest. The Chinese say they don’t want North Korea to have a nuclear weapon because it would be destabilizing in East Asia. That’s code for saying they’re afraid Japan is going to get nuclear weapons. But they have not taken the steps necessary in the past to pressure North Korea to give up the weapons because they understand just how frail that regime really is, and they’re worried it will collapse in an uncontrolled fashion that will cause them all kinds of problems.”“I think there’s a deal here. I think it’s complicated and difficult to negotiate. I wish we had started 15 years ago. But we’re in a race now, because the factor that’s changed from the last 25 years to today is, North Korea this time is really very close to having the capability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon, put it under the nose cone of an ICBM, and launch the ICBM towards the United States. That’s what’s really driving people,” Bolton observed.“Obama just watched it all happen for eight years. He’s dumped this problem on the Trump administration. But it’s also why we need a policy change. If you try in Year 26 to keep doing what you’ve done and failed to accomplish your objective, for the last 25 years – who has any reason to believe that in Year 26 you’re going to get a different result?” he asked.Marlow asked what South Koreans thought of his unification idea.“Many of them are not wild about it, because they look at the example of German reunification, they saw it was very costly to the West Germans,” Bolton conceded. “I think there are real differences between the two circumstances. I think in fact for South Korea this is a huge economic opportunity, to be perfectly crass about it. You’ve got a wage base in North Korea of roughly zero, so that by putting manufacturing and other facilities up there, eventually the wages in North Korea will be the same as the wages in South Korea, but not in the immediate future.”“It is something that’s going to come anyway,” he predicted. “The division of the Korean peninsula is unnatural, just as the division of Germany was. It was always intended to be temporary until the Cold War intervened. Therewillbe reunification one day. The issue remains, will it be accomplished in a restrained and careful fashion that works out in our interests, and maybe in the interests of China as well, or will it occur catastrophically?”“If the United States at some point has to strike preemptively against North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, there’s every prospect that that could ignite a broader conflict on the peninsula that would be devastating all around, and would almost certainly produce the collapse of the North Korean regime. I would say to China, ‘Look, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. Which would you rather do?’” he advised.“That’s why I think the larger objective of reunification has to be really the policy objective because we tried to stop the nuclear program in North Korea for 25 years and we have failed. We have failed because persuasion has failed. We have failed because coercion has failed. We have failed because the combination of coercion and persuasion has failed. So now we’re going to try it again? I just hope that’s not where the State Department is going,” said Bolton.Marlow suggested it might be difficult to reconcile the intense amount of diplomacy and economic involvement required to achieve Korean unification with President Trump’s campaign promise of an “America First” foreign policy.“The detonation of a nuclear weapon on a major American city can really concentrate your attention,” Bolton replied. “Thisisputting America first. We are a global power. That’s a reality. Therefore, our interests are worldwide. South Korea and Japan are two of our biggest trading partners, and they are threatened by this erratic, irrational regime in North Korea. We are on the verge of being threatened in the United States ourselves. We’ve got inadequate defense capabilities.”“Barack Obama gutted the national missile defense program that George Bush had started. We’d be in much better shape if we could defend ourselves against North Korean or Iranian missile launches, but we have a wholly inadequate capability at the moment. So there are a lot of challenges that the president has to face, even though – like most presidents, I suppose – he’d rather focus on domestic issues,” Bolton observed.John Bolton is a senior fellow at theAmerican Enterprise Instituteand president of his own political action committee,BoltonPAC.Breitbart News Dailyairs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern."
5326996433,http://www.breitbart.com/news/brexit-and-dollar-buffet-london-stocks/,Brexit and dollar buffet London stocks,"London (AFP) – A sharp slowdown in British growth due to Brexit and a rebounding dollar delivered a jolt to London stocks on Wednesday, while the Dow continued to push higher into record territory.While the benchmark FTSE 100 index rose modestly ahead of the presentation of Britain’s first budget update since the Brexit vote, those gains disappeared after finance minister Philip Hammond told parliament Wednesday that gross domestic product was expected to grow by only 1.4 percent next year — sharply down from the prior estimate of 2.2 percent given in March.“Markets in Europe have again struggled to keep track of record breaking US markets, rolling over into the afternoon session on the back of a selloff in bond markets and a sharp rise in the US dollar,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.A late rally helped the FTSE 100 close practically flat.“It would appear that bond investors are starting to price in the prospect of higher inflation expectations as he announced extra spending on rail, telecoms and housing as he pushed back plans to balance the books by the end of the parliament,” added Hewson.The rate of return to investors on 10-year British government bonds rose by 0.1 percentage point to 1.466 percent.A spike in the value of the dollar also cut short early gains in mining companies listed in London, as a strong greenback depresses sales of dollar-denominated commodities.The dollar shot higher following the release of data showing new orders for US manufactured durable goods rose by a sharp 4.8 in October, driven almost entirely by transportation equipment and far surpassing expectations.Meanwhile US unemployment claims remained at a relatively low level.The euro lost nearly a cent in European trading, to stand at $1.0548 in afternoon trading.The dollar spiked to a near 8-month high of 112.97 yen.– ‘Mind boggling’ –The dollar has been trading around 14-year heights as markets expect the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at their next meeting in December.FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga said “speculation of a December rate hike reached mind boggling levels” with markets having “priced in a surreal 100 percent probability of the Federal Reserve taking action before year end”.The Fed is due later Wednesday to release minutes of its most recent policy meeting.“With US interest rate increase almost a done deal next month, most may be paying attention to clues on interest rate timings for 2017,” said Otunga.The Dow added modestly to its record level, pushing 0.1 percent higher approaching midday.New York’s Dow Jones Industrial Average finished Tuesday above 19,000 for the first time ahead of this week’s US Thanksgiving holiday.The post-election rally has been propelled by expectations of pro-growth policies from President-elect Donald Trump.Investors expect Trump’s administration will cut taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and slash regulations, all of which would likely fan inflation — in turn putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise rates.Most Asian markets rose again Wednesday, tracking the record close on Wall Street, while the dollar held onto its gains against the yen on expectations of a US interest rate rise.– Key figures around 1630 GMT –London – FTSE 100: DOWN 0.03 percent at 6,817.71 points (close)Frankfurt – DAX 30: DOWN 0.5 percent at 10,622.44 (close)Paris – CAC 40: DOWN 0.4 percent at 4,529.21 (close)EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.2 percent at 3,037.63New York – Dow:  UP 0.1 percent at 19,048.49Hong Kong – Hang Seng: DOWN 0.01 percent at 22,676.69 (close)Shanghai – Composite: DOWN 0.2 percent at 3,241.14 (close)Tokyo – Nikkei 225: Closed for holidayEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0548 from $1.0627 TuesdayDollar/yen: UP at 112.75 yen from 111.05 yenPound/dollar: UP at $1.2432 from $1.2420Oil – West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 2 cents at $48.01 per barrelOil – Brent North Sea: DOWN 12 cents at $49.00"

1800567599,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA92DCAO1,Jolts and unexpected turns hit Paris' catwalks,"(AP) Jolts and unexpected turns hit Paris’ catwalksBy THOMAS ADAMSONAP Fashion WriterPARISJolts and unexpected turns marked the third day of Paris’ spring-summer 2014 shows — though some were intentional, others were not.First, there were designer Rick Owens’ unconventional models. The unrelenting fashion showman threw tradition to the wind and flew in a troupe of nearly all-black college students from the U.S. to model his ready-to-wear clothes Thursday.With curvy bodies and wild hair the 40 energetic students modeled the looks by dance, moving in a style that crossed rapper Missy Elliott’s moves with those of pom-pom bearing cheerleaders. Gone were the 6-foot (2-meter) blond and usually white beauties who fashion insiders expect to parade down the podium. Nonetheless, it had one normally sober English fashion editor nodding head and tapping his foot to the beat. Spring is, after all, a season for change.The biggest shock of the day came at the otherwise calm and gentle Nina Ricci show, when two topless activists from feminist group Femen crashed the podium. Grabbing a startled model making her way down the catwalk, they screamed “fashion fascism,” with words decrying the sexualization of the modeling industry written in make-up across their naked torsos.The rest of the day seemed quite mute in comparison, with Balmain continuing its opulent ornamentation, Barbara Bui revamping denim and Lanvin’s ode to liquid glamor.RICK OWENSIt was young, gifted and black all the way during Rick Owens’ spirited and derailed presentation.Young student-models appeared as if out of the heavens from a door at the top of a 50-foot (10-meter) metal scaffold.They glared at the front row with angry expressions, producing an energy in the room that even topped Owens’ last show, which featured live, swinging acrobats.There was one down side: The speed of the spectacle, and the fact that some of the models didn’t quite fit into the clothes made it hard to judge the collection clearly.Still, there were certainly some interesting looks among the creations, which were divided into monochrome black, beige, gray and white sections.The black looks, which featured sporty zippers and tight, structured leather paneling on tops, had some great details. One was a skirt made of baubles below a swirling, 3-D fabric panel.The white section, too, with loose clean panels of fabric, had a sporty and futuristic vibe that matched the surreally oversized Adidas pumps.The other ensembles, with beige nun-like fabric head-pieces and toga-styles, didn’t fare as well.LANVINAs if licked by a divine sheen, Alber Elbaz’s shimmering collection for Lanvin seemed to ooze liquid metal.Opening with a sensual ultramarine knee-length satin skirt and a top sporting the word “dream,” the 48-look-strong collection had a hazy, ephemeral quality that was as hard to pin down as it was beautiful.There is always a vintage quality to Lanvin’s shows _ here it’s thanks to dull shine materials used in most of the looks, rendered in the subtle hues of ruddy bronze, golden yellow and dark gray.It’s Elbaz’s nostalgia-laden interpretation of the metallics craze that’s hit catwalks this season.But the show remained light.Bows at the hip, heel and neck combined with recurring stars and love-hearts to give a girly lift.Some ensembles, like a knee-length pleated green sparkling skirt, cream blouse and long dark gray jacket eluded definition and were just plain delightful.If this spring-summer collection didn’t feel very summery _ it’s one of the darkest shows seen this week _ the amount of reflective fabric, satin and lame used in the show is sure to light up even the darkest corner of a room.BALMAINBalmain’s collection could have done with a softer touch.Designer Olivier Rousteing continued with his luxuriant explorations with sumptuous thick fabrics, gold ornamentation and blown up patterning.But the overall coherence in this for spring-summer presentation fell short of his normally stellar standard — a standard which has seen the age-old house revamped under his creative tenure.The looks in which the silhouette was neat and the checkered or houndstooth patterns delivered in softer tones worked stylishly. One soft blue mini dress with a crisscross metallic chain skirt worked to perfection thanks to the large houndstooth pattern being tamed by the look’s tight silhouette.Elsewhere, however, a visual cacophony was produced in some ensembles by the heavy ornamentation, thick quilted fabrics, and patterning with divergent lines that ended up feeling busy on the less structured silhouettes.The show had some great moments, but less would certainly have been more.NINA RICCIThough Nina Ricci’s safe spring-summer show broke no molds, there were some subtle surprises.The ultra-feminine display from designer Peter Copping in sheer whites and pale blues — and a great, bright peacock blue – drew its inspiration in historic tailoring for men.The back column of a waistcoat was to be found placed on the front of a pale striped, fitted jacket.Elsewhere, 18th century men’s riding coats appeared as a great sequined tweed number in a shimmering feminine beige.A nice detail was the reinvention of the classic men’s shirt, transformed in various looks into a dress or skirt. However, the clever effect was somewhat lost since the chosen white hue made detail hard to see.A bit of color never hurt anyone.BARBARA BUIIs there such as thing as denim rock couture? Barbara Bui seems to think so, with the French-Vietnamese designer offering collection high-wasted pants, oversize strong shouldered jackets and lots and lots of blue denim. There were plenty of hits but also some misses.The cleaner of the 37 looks worked well — with denim-effect micro shorts pairing with a T-shirt with oversize sleeves to create a nice imbalance. Elsewhere, pleated menswear 1970s trousers were subverted nicely with a sporty, and in-vogue ultra-mini crop top. Menswear Oxford shoes – in a sporty white and with silver bands — continued this subversion.The message got lost in the busy, shredded denim detailing, however, which didn’t feel very luxurious and could well have been seen on the high-street.___Thomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP"

Gov. Mike Pence said Friday the campaign would “reserve the right” to do so if that were the case.“As Donald Trump said … of course we will accept a clear election result,” he said. “But we also reserve the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of questionable results.”"

It follows anannouncementby National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan that the U.S. was ending its support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen on behalf of the legitimate government.The Houthis launched the war in 2014. Iran backs the rebels, partly because control of Yemen gives Iran a strategic position across the Bab el Mandeb Strait from U.S. forces that are stationed in Djibouti on the Red Sea. Both sides in the civil war havecommittedatrocities.The move is Biden’s latest slap to U.S. allies in the region — and an apparent attempt to appease Iran, which the Biden administration hopes to entice back to the negotiating table.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) accused Biden of appeasement in astatementSaturday:The Houthi rebels are armed and trained by Iran’s overseas terror corps, the IRGC and Hezbollah. They fire missiles at civilians and American sailors while chanting ‘Death to America.’ And they’ve plunged Yemen into a protracted war that has immiserated the Yemeni people. If that’s not terrorism, I don’t know what is. President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken may foolishly believe that a gesture of goodwill toward the Houthis will lead to peace, but the rebels have ignored the peace process for years while refusing to honor ceasefires. The Biden administration is repeating the deadly errors of the Obama administration by appeasing Iran and refusing to call terrorists by their name.The Obama administration backed Saudi intervention in Yemen, but Democrats began to oppose the war once President Donald Trump came into office and began improving relations with Saudi Arabia. Trump listed the Houthis as a terror group in his last weeks in office.Joel B.

Ralph Northam (R-VA) was hit with two wowser scandals, his support with Virginia Democrats only dropped from 70 percent to 50 percent.That 20 point drop represents a slip of just 29 percent.Yep, a full 50 percent of Democrats still support Governor Blackface Baby-Killer.It gets worse… Only 25 percent of Democratsdisapproveof Governor Blackface Baby-Killer, while 24 percent aren’t sure. They’re still mulling it over.With Independents, support for Northam crashed by more than half, from 42 percent to just 20 percent.Same with Republicans, whose support slipped from 31 percent to just 15 percent.But even after Northam exposed himself as someone who believes a woman’s right to abort her child extends to after the baby is born, even after Northam admitted to performing in blackface as a grown man of 24 in 1984, his support with Democrats holds at 50 percent.Here is Northam just five days ago expressing his views onfourth trimesterabortions:When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician—more than one physician, by the way—and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s non-viable… If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. So I think this was really blown out of proportion. We want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.To recap: The child has been born. The child is dying. But before the child can be saved, it will be made “comfortable” and then the participants in the birth will convene to decide if a helpless newborn — that is dying in front a doctor trained to save its life — should have its life saved.That is what Northam wants to legalize, and 50 percent of Democrats are, like,Yeah, so? Orange Man Bad.But that’s not all…On Friday, Northam admitted he participated in a racist photo featuring one person in full Ku Klux Klan uniform standing with a guy in full blackface.Then on Saturday he said it was his “belief” that was not him in the photo, and he had a doozy of an alibi… You see, he couldn’t have posed in the blackface/KKK photo because he was out somewhere else putting on blackface to imitate Michael Jackson.No, he actuallysaid that:My belief that I did not wear that costume or attend that party stems, in part, by my clear memory of other mistakes I made in the same period of my life. That same year, I did participate in a dance contest in San Antonio in which I darkened my face as part of a Michael Jackson costume.You see, officer, I couldn’t have killed my mother-in-law because I remember killing my wife.And then, as a means to prove his alibi, the 59-year-old offered to moonwalk for reporters. Seriously.Fer’ real..Mr. and Mrs. Virginia Democrat: You’ve just learned that your governor is in favor of allowing babies to be left to die, enjoyed the nickname “Coonman” in college, wore blackface as an adult, and has no idea whatsoever how in the world that blackface/KKK photo ended up on his own personal yearbook page.

This did not placate the staffers, so they sent for campus police.The students dropped their signs and linked arms as a result.The police warned Maldonado directly, and the students moved their protest to the lawn to avoid further incident.The ASU administration released the following statement when asked about the protest:As an institution of higher education and an environment that promotes academic freedom, Arizona State University supports the free exchange and expression of ideas. All individuals and groups on campus have the right to express their opinions, whatever those opinions may be, as long as they do not violate student code of conduct and student organization policies and do not infringe on another student’s individual rights. This policy applies to all students.Maldonado has been involved in protests throughout Arizona before. According to heruniversity profile, the Mexican-born professor has participated “in the immigrant rights movement in Arizona” and has “spent many hours organizing protests against Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio.”"

Around 3,700 migrants are living in a camp on the outskirts of the city, nicknamed the “Jungle”, hoping to smuggle themselves across the Channel to Britain on lorries or trains.Anti-Islamic group Pegida, which began as a movement in Germany in mid-2014 and has since spread to France and other European countries, has called on members and sympathisers across Europe to join marches on Saturday.Ahead of the protest, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve on Wednesday called on authorities in Calais to prevent all demonstrations “regardless of the organisers”.He said the ban particularly covered “all these groups that create tensions, division and violence” and would last as long as necessary.Pegida, an acronym for “Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident,” has said it expects demonstrations to take place in 14 European countries.Also on Saturday, in a relatively rare attempt to reach England by sea, four migrants were rescued from their sinking boat in the Channel thanks to a fifth migrant who made it to shore and alerted rescuers."
1340375875,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA6JQIQG1,More charges may come in case involving Haslams,"(AP) More charges may come in case involving HaslamsBy SHEILA BURKEAssociated PressNASHVILLE, Tenn.Sudden guilty pleas by a pair of mid-level executives show the investigation into the truck stop chain controlled by the family of Tennessee’s governor and the Cleveland Browns’ owner is picking up steam, with prosecutors likely setting their sights on higher-ups at the company, experts say.The guilty pleas entered Wednesday were the first stemming from a two-year investigation of a rebate program at Pilot Flying J, the company controlled by the family of Gov. Bill Haslam and Browns owner Jimmy Haslam. The charges were filed weeks after a raid of the company’s Knoxville headquarters and other locations. The fruits of that raid, along with secret recordings and at least three key cooperating witnesses, point to more charges to come.“The government is not going to offer what appears to be attractive plea bargains to people unless they fully intend to prosecute perhaps the company or perhaps higher-ups in the company,” said Nashville attorney David Raybin, who is not involved in the case. “These two people are not their ultimate targets. The targets are the company and the higher-ups at the company.”Court documents don’t make clear exactly which executives _ or how high-ranking they were _ may have known about the alleged fraud. But the two who pleaded guilty appear to be key players in terms of knowledge and information and could prove valuable witnesses, Raybin said.One former federal prosecutor said the government can offer powerful incentives to get employees in a corporate fraud case to implicate their co-workers.“Usually people lower-level have information, and in my experience the government is going to want that information to see whether they can go up the chain,” said Ty Howard, who is a former assistant U.S. attorney in Nashville who now defends people accused of white-collar crimes. He is not involved in the Pilot Flying J case.Employees implicating their superiors is not unheard of. Earlier this year, a longtime subordinate implicated former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship in the case of a mine explosion that killed 29 miners in West Virginia. David C. Hughart, the former president of Massey’s White Buck Coal Co., said Blankenship ordered his employees to warn miners of surprise federal inspections.The subordinate pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges, but an attorney for Blankenship has denied his client did anything wrong. Blankenship has not been charged.Court documents say sales employees were trained on how to defraud trucking companies of discounts and rebates owed to them by being loyal customers of Pilot Flying J.Court papers outlining the plea deals say regional sales director Arnold Ralenkotter and regional accounts representative Ashley Smith Judd _ the employees who pleaded guilty _ were part of the conspiracy to boost profits and pad commissions.Pilot Flying J, the country’s largest diesel retailer with annual revenues of $31 billion, was founded by the Haslams’ father. Forbes listed the truck stop chain as the 6th largest privately owned company in America.Jimmy Haslam has denied any wrongdoing and has suspended several members of the sales team, but he has declined to identify exactly who has been suspended. An affidavit unsealed last month shows that a Pilot employee was secretly recorded saying Jimmy Haslam knew what sales people were doing.The company has launched its own internal investigation, and Jimmy Haslam has said that the review suggested about 5 percent of the company’s customers received less rebate money because of manual adjustments by Pilot employees.A spokesman for the company said the guilty pleas were “disappointing” but not surprising given what Pilot’s own internal investigation has revealed.“We want to assure our customers that we are taking every step to correct any wrongdoing that has occurred and to make certain that it does not happen again,” Pilot Flying J spokesman Tom Ingram said in a statement.Jimmy Haslam’s brother, Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, has no role in running the company but has a significant financial stake in the business. He has insisted he has “faith and confidence” in his brother’s ability to deal with the situation.Court documents in Ralenkotter’s and Judd’s cases show that fraud was well-known among sales staff and that Pilot’s national account sales director taught employees how to defraud trucking companies out of rebate money without getting caught.Court records say it was often difficult for trucking companies to track how much money they were entitled to in Pilot rebates and discounts because there were so many variables in the company’s diesel price discount program.Documents indicate people both higher and lower than Ralenkotter were aware of the fraud. Ralenkotter even threatened to take a customer account away from a subordinate if the worker did not go along with the deception, court documents say.Raybin, the outside attorney, said the general rule is that the first person to make a deal with the prosecutor is the first to get out of jail. By dividing and conquering, prosecutors can move up the chain by using information given by the two employees who pleaded guilty to get others, he said.An affidavit released in April showed that the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service have been investigating the company for about two years, and that they had secret recordings of company officials discussing the rebate scheme.However, Howard cautioned that bosses are not necessarily complicit in crimes committed by lower-level employees.“Even in a corporate fraud context, you could certainly have a rogue employee who committed some crime but the higher-ups are not criminally culpable,” he said."
6717329627,http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/06/07/uk-supreme-court-rejects-legal-challenge-to-northern-ireland-abortion-laws/,UK Supreme Court Rejects Legal Challenge to Northern Ireland Abortion Laws,"LONDON (AP) – Britain’s Supreme Court on Thursday criticized Northern Ireland’s strict anti-abortion laws but dismissed a legal challenge.A majority of the court decided that the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which initiated the case, did not have the standing to bring the challenge to the abortion law. The court dismissed the case without taking action.The justices went on to say, however, that a majority finds Northern Ireland’s abortion prohibitions “disproportionate” and that they violate European human rights laws.That part of the ruling gave hope to abortion rights activists seeking to liberalize Northern Ireland’s laws.Strict Northern Ireland laws that prohibit abortions in cases of pregnancy as a result of incest or rape, and in cases when the fetus has a likely fatal abnormality, have drawn scrutiny since the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in May to repeal its own strict laws.When Ireland replaces the constitutional ban with more liberal legislation after a debate in parliament, Northern Ireland will be the only remaining region in Britain and Ireland to outlaw the procedure.Rosa Curling, from the law firm Leigh Day that helped bring the legal challenge, called the court’s ruling “a momentous day for women in Northern Ireland” and said it is now up to British Prime Minister Theresa May to take action to ease the laws.She said May has an obligation to make sure the U.K. government is “now longer acting unlawfully by breaching the human rights of women across Northern Ireland.”However, the fact that the Supreme Court dismissed the case because of doubts about the Human Rights Commission’s right to bring it means the judges’ views on the anti-abortion laws do not have legal force, which is reassuring for abortion foes.Laurence Wilkinson, legal counsel for ADF International, a group that advocates the right to live according to religious belief, said it welcomes the dismissal of the case, asserting that “at least 100,000 people in Northern Ireland are alive today” because of the decision not to liberalize laws in 1967, when Wales, England and Scotland eased restrictions.He said the divisions among Supreme Court justices on the Northern Ireland laws revealed a “complete lack of consensus” on the matter.The issue is further clouded by the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a power-sharing regional government set up by the 1998 Good Friday accord."

There’s still good senators. But there’s a lot that just want to keep it the way it is.”"
7879094156,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/19/ann-coulter-honey-we-molested-the-kids/,"Ann Coulter: Honey, We Molested the Kids!","I wonder if any liberals are re-thinking their insistence that the Boy Scouts allow gay men to take 13-year-old boys on overnight camping trips.HEADLINE:Boy Scouts Files Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the Face of Thousands of Child Abuse AllegationsThe Boy Scouts of America (BSA) have long been on the left’s hate list. Any organization that has the temerity to train young men in the virtues of integrity, patriotism, and self-reliance is putting itself on the fighting side of liberals!At the 2000 Democratic National Convention, a little group of Boy Scouts took the stage as part of the opening ceremony — and were promptly booed by the delegates.For decades, the BSA has fended off lawsuits demanding that they embrace the holy trinity of G’s: girls, gays, and godless atheists. (If only it had occurred to the plaintiffs to start their own organizations! They could have given them names like “The Girl Scouts.”)Why would any liberal want to join an organization that was, according to them, sexist, Bible-thumping, and bigoted? They didn’t. The lawsuits were kill shots.For the left, what’s not to hate about the Boy Scouts? Their oath is: “On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.”Nearly 200 NASA astronauts were Boy Scouts. The great outdoorsman, Teddy Roosevelt, was such a BSA booster than he was made the one and only “Chief Scout Citizen,” a scout for life.A Louis Harris & Associates study in 1996 found that men who had been scouts placed a higher value on honesty than those who had not.But now the lawsuits have killed them. Congratulations, Democrats, theNew York Times, and corporate America. (I hope all their future employees steal from them, after being raised on “Grand Theft Auto” instead of the Boy Scout oath.)From the beginning, BSA has had to deal with child molesters eagerly signing up to go camping with 13-year-old boys in isolated areas away from all observation.Within a decade of its 1910 founding, the BSA began keeping internal files on “ineligible” scouting volunteers, known as “the perversion files.”Scout leaders were not to be alone with boys and, starting in 1988, all adult applicants were subjected to aggressive background screening. The organization promptly removed any scout leaders based on mere suspicion and alerted law enforcement in about a third of the cases.Nonetheless, between 1970 and 1991, up to .04 percent of Boy Scouts may have been molested. That’s about 2,000 out of several million boys.Given all of this, what sort of escaped mental patient would demand that the Boy Scouts admit openly gay scout leaders?Yes, we know most gays aren’t child molesters. How could we not? It’s part of our secular catechism, along with the one about most Muslims not being terrorists and most immigrants not being criminals.But men who molest boys are a small slice — infinitesimal really! — within a larger category known as “gay.” It’s not two totally different things, like an architect and a dentist. Some men like blondes. Some like brunettes. But they’re all within the category of “heterosexual.”No parent is going to send their young sons camping alone in the woods with an openly gay man for the same reason they wouldn’t send their adolescent daughters to be alone in the woods with an openly heterosexual man.And now the BSA has been whiplashed into bankruptcy by liberals demanding, on one hand, that the scouts allow gays to be troop leaders and, on the other hand, filing lawsuits accusing the scouts of not taking strong enough measures to prevent gay troop leaders from molesting boys.Couldn’t liberals get together and decide for themselves whether the Boy Scouts should have been more aggressive in preventing child molestation — or less?For their defense witnesses, the Boy Scouts should callNew York Timeseditors, Democratic politicians, and corporate CEOs.Back in 1980, when a gay guy lost his lawsuit against BSA for dropping him as a scout leader, Wells Fargo, the United Way of San Francisco, Levi Strauss, and the Bank of America cut off funding to the organization. San Francisco and Oakland schools prohibited the scouts from using their facilities on weekdays.After the Supreme Court’s disturbingly narrow 5-4 decision in 2000 holding that the Boy Scouts could not be forced to admit gay scout leaders, theTimesdenounced the decision in an editorial, calling the court’s ruling “one of its lowest moments of the term.”The following month, theTimes’“ethicist,” Randy Cohen, advised a reader to pull her son out of the Cub Scouts, saying it was “the ethical thing to do.” The “ethicist” explained: “Just as one is honor bound to quit an organization that excludes African-Americans, so you should withdraw from scouting as long as it rejects homosexuals.”Also in response to the Supreme Court’s decision, Chase Manhattan Bank, Textron Inc., and dozens more United Way chapters withdrew millions of dollars in contributions. More cities dropped their support of the Boy Scouts.In his pre-Super Bowl TV interview in 2013, President Barack Obama was still harping on the Boy Scouts’ refusal to allow gay scoutmasters: “Gays and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybody else does.”On CNN, host Carol Costello haughtily informed a guest opposed to gay scoutmasters, “Well, I’ll just say that the American Psychological Association has studied the issue that you just mentioned. Homosexuals aren’t any more likely to molest kids than straight men.”The defense rests.Throughout the left’s 30-year assault on the Boy Scouts for discriminating against gays, the Catholic Church was embroiled in its own molestation crisis. More than 80 percent of the molester priests were accused of victimizing teenage boys.Instead of saying, “Oh — I see what the Boy Scouts are doing,” liberals responded to the gay sex-abuse crisis in the priesthood by blaming … celibacy!Isn’t it a thought crime to question whether sexual preference is determined at birth? But liberals not only believed gayness was the result of an adult lifestyle choice — celibacy — but they knew how to “cure” it: Allow priests to marry!Since the one thing we know is that men molesting boys has nothing to do with being gay, I guess this time it’s camping that causes sodomy."
5476946243,http://www.breitbart.com/news/company-that-hhs-pick-invested-in-faced-criminal-penalty/,Company that HHS pick invested in faced criminal penalty,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A medical device company in which Rep. Tom Price purchased stock last year has faced years of legal problems and agreed in December to a $17 million Justice Department criminal penalty in a foreign bribery case.Democrats this week challenged the Georgia Republican, who is President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for health secretary, on his investments and potential conflict of interest.Among the companies at the center of the controversy is Zimmer Biomet, a major manufacturer of orthopedic and dental implant devices.The Indiana-based company agreed to pay $17.4 million to resolve allegations that it had schemed to bribe Mexican government officials through a third-party distributor in Brazil. Federal prosecutors said the misconduct occurred even though the company in 2012 had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department arising from separate foreign bribery allegations. The payments were intended to allow a Mexican subsidiary of the company to import contraband dental implants into Mexico, prosecutors said.As part of an agreement with the Justice Department, the company was charged with failing to implement accounting controls and agreed to have a monitor for three years.Trump transition spokesman Phillip Blando said Thursday that “any effort to link Dr. Price’s investment portfolio to a company’s legal troubles is nonsensical, absurd, and insulting.”Price’s acquisition of Zimmer Biomet stock, which became a contentious issue in a Senate confirmation hearing this week, came around the same time Price introduced legislation to suspend Medicare rules seen as problematic for such companies.Blando said Price had been working on the legislation for months, that the stock purchase was made as part of a broader rebalancing of his portfolio and that the purchase was made by his stockbroker, though Price at his hearing did say that he had directed his broker to purchase shares in another company, Innate Immunotherapeutics.At his hearing, Price sparred with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, over his involvement in the Zimmer Biomet purchase. Price at one point noted that the stocks were brought by a broker and that he was not making the decisions, but he acknowledged that the transactions were made on his behalf.“Let’s just be clear: This is not just a stockbroker, someone you pay to handle the paperwork,” Warren said. “This is someone who buys stock at your direction, this is someone who buys and sells the stock you want them to buy and sell?”“Not true. That’s not true, Senator,” Price said.“Because you decide not to tell them — wink, wink, nod, nod — and we’re all just supposed to believe that,” Warren said.___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP"

4746027219,http://www.breitbart.com/news/us-reveals-joint-patrols-in-south-china-sea-with-philippines/,US reveals joint patrols in South China Sea with Philippines,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The United States on Thursday revealed for the first time that American ships have started conducting joint patrols with the Philippines in the South China Sea, a somewhat rare move not done with many other partners in the region.At the same time, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced at a joint news conference with Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmi that the United States will be keeping nearly 300 troops, including Air Force commandos armed with combat aircraft and helicopters, in the Philippines through the end of the month. It’s part of a military build-up sure to inflame tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea.The U.S. will also begin sending forces on increased rotations into the Philippines, it was disclosed, to beef up training and to support increased military operations in the region.The increase in military support comes just days after a Philippine diplomat asked that the U.S. help convince China not to build in the nearby Scarborough Shoal, which is viewed as important to Filipino fishermen. Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Cuisia Jr. said the Philippines is not capable of stopping China from constructing there. China has built man-made islands in other contested spots in the South China Sea.According to the Pentagon, the U.S. forces that will remain here are already in the Philippines participating in the Balikatan or shoulder-to-shoulder combat exercises which will end Friday. About 200 airmen, including special operations forces will remain at Clark Air Base, along with three of their Pave Hawk attack helicopters, an MC-130H Combat Talon II special mission aircraft and five A-10 combat aircraft.This initial contingent will provide training to increase the two militaries’ ability to work together, laying the groundwork for forces to do joint air patrols as well as the ship movements.Also, up to 75 Marines will stay at Camp Aguinaldo to support increased U.S. and Philippine combined military operations in the region.The troops and aircraft are expected to leave at the end of the month, but other U.S. forces and aircraft would do similar rotations into the Philippines in the future. A defense official would not say how frequently those rotations would happen, but said the size schedule and makeup would fluctuate. The official was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.The increased troop presence is part of a broader U.S. campaign to expand its assistance to the Philippines, as America shores up its allies in the Asia Pacific. And it comes as territorial disputes with China, including Beijing’s increasing effort to build manmade islands in the South China Sea, roils nations across the region.The U.S. and others have consistently said the military exercises and assistance packages are not aimed at China but represent America’s continued support for its allies in the region. But China views any increased U.S. military presence and activities in the region as a threat.Last week the Pentagon announced that the U.S. will send about $40 million in military assistance to the Philippines to beef up intelligence sharing, surveillance and naval patrols. Carter said the aid will include an enhanced information network for classified communications, sensors for patrol vessels and an unmanned aerostat reconnaissance airship.The patrol sensors and surveillance equipment will help the Philippines keep a watch over its territory, including areas where there are overlapping claims in the South China Sea.Officials also recently announced that the U.S. will get access to five Philippine military bases to house American forces that will rotate in and out of the country for training and other missions.Scarborough Shoal is at the center of a case that Manila filed with the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an international panel, in January 2013 after Chinese coast guard ships took effective control of the disputed land following a tense standoff with Filipino ships.The shoal sits about 145 miles (230 kilometers) west of the Philippines, and 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the Chinese coast.The court has agreed to take the case and is expected to rule in the coming months. Beijing has objected, saying the panel has no jurisdiction in the matter.Cuisia said that a senior U.S. Navy official reported spotting a suspected Chinese survey ship in the Scarborough Shoal a few weeks ago  The Philippine military checked but found nothing, possibly because the Chinese ship later left the shoal, he said. Philippine officials worry that China is eyeing the vast atoll as its next target for island building.China has said it has completed construction work to turn seven reefs into islands in the disputed Spratlys archipelago in the South China Sea, a move condemned by the U.S. and other partners in the region. Officials have also seen runways, fighter jets and other weapons on some of the islands.Beijing says it owns the Spratlys, which it calls the Nansha Islands, and has a right to build there."

The other teams have games in hand but they play each other.“My belief was always strong and still is. I’m confident we will do it.”Wenger’s belief in Arsenal’s ability to cope with the stresses and strains of the run-in hasn’t been dented despite Everton knocking them out of their stride with an overtly aggressive game plan.The Frenchman felt Everton sent out to ruffle his team, but he claimed their tactics would have been scuppered if midfielder Darron Gibson had been sent off for a series of crunching challenges in the first half.Gibson was booked after crunching into Jack Wilshere but escaped a second yellow card following a crude barge into Theo Walcott.“Yes I think Gibson should have been sent off. He should have had a yellow card even before his first booking,” Wenger said.“It was a game of huge intensity, they decided to make it physical to disturb our game.“I don’t blame Everton for that. To say we needed protecting is a big word, we just want the referee to make the right decisions.“I don’t think the referee dealt well with the intimidating physical challenges in the first half.”Wenger refused to be drawn on reports that England star Wilshere had become embroiled in a tunnel bust-up with Everton’s Kevin Mirallas at half-time, adding: “I don’t know about that but I will find out. The dressing room was quiet after.”While Wenger is confident of his side’s top-four ambitions, Everton manager David Moyes was willing to admit his team’s hopes of gatecrashing the Champions League party were starting to fade.Everton are four points behind Chelsea and Moyes said: “I’m pleased with the performance, I don’t think you are ever disappointed to take a point at the Emirates.“I’m not sure what a point does for us. Are we really going to overhaul Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea?“The players knew tonight what was at stake, it was a big chance to go and do it.“I would take the Europa League. I think that’s realistic but to be in with a shout of the Champions League at this stage of the season is good for Everton.”Moyes also insisted there was nothing wrong with Everton’s no-holds-barred approach.“We weren’t going to let Arsenal stroke the ball around with 500 passes,” he said.“We were committed and made some tackles. Believe it or not that’s allowed in football. Some teams from up north do that kind of thing.”Asked about the tunnel row between Mirallas and Wilshere, Moyes made a pointed reference to Wenger as he added: “I didn’t see it, and I know someone who says that quite a lot!”"
7069829092,https://www.breitbart.com/blog/2013/01/24/the-weakness-of-a-constituency-system/,One possible weakness of a constituency system,"Alexis de Tocqueville wrote inDemocracy in Americathat democracies are weak when it comes to foreign policy. The Senate’s failure to hold Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama himself accountable for the Benghazi disaster is a case in point. But the Clinton hearing, and the confirmation hearing of her successor, Sen. John Kerry (D-MA), the day after, revealed an additional weakness of our system.Proponents of a parliamentary, proportional system or representation, as opposed to our winner-takes-all constituency system, argue (correctly) that parliamentary systems do a better job of representing political minorities. The advantage of our constituency-based system is that representatives are directly accountable to the people, not to distant party bosses–at least in theory, and certainly more so than in parliamentary models.But constituency-based systems seem to do a poor job when they must defend the legislative branch as a whole against an onslaught from the executive. That is especially the case when the head of government is not chosen by the legislature. There are simply too many divided interests to present a united front except in rare cases.In interviewing Clinton, for example, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would have been far more effective if it had chosen a few Senators to lead questioning, rather than chopping up the opportunities among the different Senators, each of whom only had a short period of time to speak. There was little time to develop lines of questioning that led anywhere–and the Senators, eager to place their remarks on the record for public consumption back home, wasted much of their time bloviating instead of confronting the Secretary of State.There was a need for united opposition precisely because the administration has defied the Senate–most vividly in Clinton’s outburst: “What difference does it make?” She should have been rebuked for that, and should not have been allowed to escape Sen. Ron Johnson’s line of question, but the microphone simply passed to another Senator shortly thereafter. We do not need (nor should we want) proportional representation, but better coordination among legislators would go a long way toward reducing an inherent vulnerability."
5065078009,http://www.breitbart.com/news/dozens-dead-as-warplanes-pound-rebel-held-north-syria/,Dozens dead as warplanes pound rebel-held north Syria,"Beirut (AFP) – Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria, killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo.The strikes, which began on Saturday and were continuing on Sunday, killed at least 45 civilians in Aleppo and west of the city and 22 more in neighbouring Idlib province, a monitoring group said.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes were targeting areas held by the Army of Conquest, an alliance of rebel, Islamist and jihadist forces that has mounted a major offensive to seize Aleppo.“The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest,” the head of the Britain-based Observatory, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP.An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa, seized by rebel fighters earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo on Saturday, the Observatory said.Aleppo, Syria’s former economic hub and a focal point of the country’s five-year civil war, has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012.– Intensifying battle –Fighting for the city has intensified this summer, after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July.After a nearly three-week siege, rebel forces took Ramussa on August 6, linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods.Emboldened by the win, the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo, which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syria’s conflict.The increased fighting has raised deep concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo, including some 250,000 in rebel-controlled areas.The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city, which has suffered from severe shortages of food, water and medical supplies.Russia launched air strikes last September in support of Assad, helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory.The defence ministry in Moscow said Sunday that six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor, a stronghold of the Islamic State group in Syria.IS controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of oil-rich Deir Ezzor province in the east of the country — part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that the group seized in mid-2014.The ministry said in a statement that the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids to the southwest, east and northeast of the city, wiping out two command posts, six arms depots, IS vehicles and “a large number of fighters”.IS emerged amid the chaos of Syria’s conflict, a complex and multi-front war that has left more than 290,000 dead and forced millions from their homes since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011.– Girl evacuated –A US-led coalition is also battling IS in Syria and Iraq, with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces, an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance, which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after an IS retreat.The jihadists took some 2,000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear.Kurdish television showed footage of jubilant civilians in Manbij, including smiling mothers who had shed their veils and men who had lived for weeks under a shaving ban cutting their beards.In rare good news from the conflict, a 10-year-old girl who was shot in the besieged town of Madaya was evacuated to a Damascus hospital where she was in a stable condition, the Observatory and a Syrian security source said.Ghina Quwayder’s leg was shattered when she was shot by a government sniper at a checkpoint in the southwestern town earlier this month while buying medicine for her mother, according to Amnesty International.The rights group had launched a campaign urging help for the girl to be evacuated. The Syrian Red Crescent was able to bring Ghina and her mother Sahar to Damascus after midnight on Sunday."

Approves China-Backed Internet Convention, Alarming Rights Advocates","(AFP) — The United Nations on Friday approved a Russian-led bid that aims to create a new convention on cybercrime, alarming rights groups and Western powers that fear a bid to restrict online freedom.The General Assembly approved the resolution sponsored by Russia and backed by China, which would set up a committee of international experts in 2020.The panel will work to set up “a comprehensive international convention on countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes,” the resolution said.The United States, European powers and rights groups fear that the language is code for legitimizing crackdowns on expression, with numerous countries defining criticism of the government as “criminal.”China heavily restricts internet searches to avoid topics sensitive to its communist leadership, as well as news sites with critical coverage.A number of countries have increasingly tried to turn off the internet, with India cutting off access in Kashmir in August after it stripped autonomy to the Muslim-majority region and Iran taking much of the country offline as it cracked down on protests in November.“It is precisely our fear that (a new convention) would allow the codification at an international and global level of these types of controls that’s driving our opposition and our concerns about this resolution,” a US official said.Any new UN treaty that spells out internet controls would be “inimical to the United States’ interests because that doesn’t tally with the fundamental freedoms we see as necessary across the globe,” he said.Human Rights Watch called the UN resolution’s list of sponsors “a rogue’s gallery of some of the earth’s most repressive governments.”“If the plan is to develop a convention that gives countries legal cover for internet blackouts and censorship, while creating the potential for criminalizing free speech, then it’s a bad idea,” said Human Rights Watch’s Louis Charbonneau.The United States argues that the world should instead expand its sole existing accord on cybercrime, the 2001 Budapest Convention, which spells out international cooperation to curb copyright violations, fraud and child pornography.Russia has opposed the Budapest Convention, arguing that giving investigators access to computer data across borders violates national sovereignty.The Budapest Convention was drafted by the Council of Europe, but other countries have joined, including the United States and Japan.A new UN treaty on cybercrime could render the Budapest Convention obsolete, further alarming rights groups."

Chidambaram told the Economic Times newspaper.“I accepted, so now we are in search mode,” Chidambaram said.Subbarao had indicated that he wanted to leave on time in September, but media speculated the Congress-led government would prefer not to make changes until after national elections due in May.The RBI has been in crisis management mode in recent weeks as it attempts to steady the ailing local currency, which hit a record low against the dollar this month.The bank is also under pressure from business to cut interest rates to spur economic growth, which is running at a decade low of five percent.Subbarao issued his last monetary policy statement as governor on Tuesday, when he held interest rates steady as the bank focuses on trying to keep the rupee stable rather than pushing for growth.The bank also lowered India’s growth forecast from 5.7 percent to 5.5 percent, as the government struggles to kickstart the economy.Subbarao, 63, an economist and civil official, was appointed RBI head in 2008 during the global financial crisis. He was given a two-year extension in September 2011.Under his watch India’s economy has gone through a tough phase, hit by decade-low growth, high inflation, a record low for the Indian currency and a steep current account deficit.An independent thinker, Subbarao, in recent years has faced criticism from business leaders and the government for not easing monetary policy to spur growth.The government’s chief economic advisor, Raghuram Rajan, India’s economic affairs secretary Arvind Mayaram and Planning Commission member Saumitra Chaudhary are contenders to succeed Subbarao, the newspaper said."

Spicer also pointed out that sending federal money to cities that choose to not cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement is unfair to taxpayers.According tothe Washington Post, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement compliance report obtained by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center showed that, in the 168 counties across America where most of the USA’s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants live, 69 counties refuse federal requests to hold arrestees in jail due to their immigration status.In his effort to force cities to cooperate with federal law enforcement and protect American sovieegntry, President Trump may have allies at the state level, asUSA Todayreports:Help won’t be hard to find. Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Duncan Hunter of California and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, have tried in recent years to pass laws establishing those kinds of cuts, but they always faced a veto threat from Obama. Republicans filed similar bills this week, and those have a far better chance of becoming law now that Republicans control both Congress and the White House.Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA, which favors lower immigration levels, said it’s impossible to know how nasty the fight will get over sanctuary cities given the raw emotions on both sides. “I’m not going to rule anything out,” she said.AsBreitbart News has reported, mayors of major cities such as New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago have vowed to keep their sanctuary city policies intact.Follow Breitbart News investigative reporter andCitizen JournalismSchool founder Lee Stranahan on Twitter at@Stranahan."

5704849708,http://www.breitbart.com/news/masters-leader-hoffman-tees-off-with-top-rivals-on-his-heels/,Masters leader Hoffman tees off with top rivals on his heels,"Augusta (United States) (AFP) – Unheralded American Charley Hoffman teed off Friday with a three-stroke lead in the second round of the Masters while his nearest rivals were already making a morning charge.The second round of the year’s first major championship opened in cool and breezy conditions at 7,435-yard Augusta National, brisk winds likely to play havoc with top shotmakers as they did for most on day one.“I’ll try to make pars but I’m looking for more out there,” Hoffman said Friday.“This game is put yourself in position — attack when you can, but when you get out of position, be conservative.”Hoffman birdied five of the last seven holes, including four in a row starting at the par-4 14th, in windy conditions to shoot a seven-under par 65 in Thursday’s opening round.That gave him a four-stroke edge on fellow American McGirt, the largest 18-hole lead at the Masters since Jack Burke’s four-shot margin over Julius Boros in 1955.McGirt, playing in his first Masters, went off in Friday’s first group and was one-under through nine holes while England’s 43-year-old Lee Westwood, third after an opening 70, and Spain’s Sergio Garcia, who began on 71, teed off directly after Hoffman’s group.“It’s good to know I handled the conditions well yesterday,” Westwood said. “It’s going to be similar, just another day of grinding and patience. One-under is an excellent score.”McGirt opened Friday with a bogey but answered with birdies at the par-5 second and par-3 fourth on his way to making the turn four-under for the tournament and one-under on the round.Hoffman, who booked his fourth Masters start by winning last year’s PGA Texas Open, shared ninth at Augusta National in 2015 for his best showing in 22 major starts.“I look forward to the challenge the next three days,” Hoffman said. “The putter is going my way now and hopefully I’ll keep it going.”Westwood, trying to capture his first major title after 75 prior attempts, and Garcia, in his 74th major start without a triumph, hope for a breakthrough title this weekend.– Rose, Mickelson start late –Late afternoon starters in the pack on 71 included England’s Justin Rose, the reigning Olympic champion and 2013 US Open winner, and Phil Mickelson, a five-time major champion. At two months shy of his 47th birthday, the US left-hander would become the oldest winner in Masters history if he captures a fourth green jacket on Sunday.Big names had their issues on a blustery first day at Augusta, the most stunning being top-ranked Dustin Johnson withdrawing due to a back injury suffered in a Wednesday fall down stairs in a rented home.Second-ranked Rory McIlroy, a four-time major winner seeking a Masters victory to complete a career grand slam, made bogeys on two of his first three holes on day one but birdied three of four holes starting at the par-5 13th to open on 72.Jordan Spieth, the 2015 Masters champion and two-time Masters runner-up, soared to a 75 Thursday for his worst Augusta National round. He parred the par-3 12th, where a quadruple bogey nightmare in last year’s final round doomed his title repeat hopes, but then made quadruple bogey at the par-5 15th.– Woeful start for Willett –Defending champion Danny Willett of England opened Friday’s round with a quadruple bogey at the par-4 first, tumbling down the leaderboard to five-over for the tournament.Four-time major champion Ernie Els of South Africa and Rio Olympic bronze medalist Matt Kuchar of the United States made bogey-birdie starts after opening 72s to stay seven back as Hoffman’s round began.World number three Jason Day of Australia, who will be the final player to take to the course Friday, opened on 74.The cut will be made to the 60 lowest scores and ties and any player within 10 strokes of the lead after Friday’s second round.Among those in jeopardy of not reaching the weekend were Japan’s fourth-ranked Hideki Matsuyama, who opened on 76, and reigning British Open champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden, who began on 77."

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) claims that the riot started after prisoners demanded “fair trials” and to “see their families.”Inmates “tried to break down the walls and doors of the prison” resulting in “casualties,” SOHR reports.According to Rudaw, “SDF-affiliated news agency NPA shared footageof military reinforcements arriving at the prison to control the scene.” SOHR reports that “U.S.-led coalition helicopters” were seen flying over the city at “low altitude.”Surveillance aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition are stationed around the prison toprovideintelligence to the SDF, according to American military newspaperStars and Stripes.Monday’s riot was the latest in a string of disturbances at Hasakah’s prison in recent months.

Additional riots took place in May, Rudaw reports.An estimated 3,000-5000 prisoners of roughly 50 nationalities are held in the Hasakah prison.

Manila and Jakarta were also higher.But Seoul shed 0.8 percent, Sydney was flat and Singapore eased 0.1 percent. Mumbai dropped 0.7 percent and Bangkok fell 0.6 percent.London opened 0.2 percent higher, Paris added 0.3 percent and Frankfurt was flat.In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was lower against most other currencies after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting showed it was growing concerned about the impact of Trump’s trade war.The central bank is expected to cut interest rates for a third time when the board meets again later this month.The minutes “revealed greater concerns over downside risk from slowing global growth and trade tensions with subdued inflation also seen as a reason to cut”, said Rodrigo Catril at National Australia Bank.But he pointed out that “a few officials saw the need to push back against market Fed rate cut expectations”.Oil prices extended Wednesday’s losses following data showing a bigger-than-forecast pick-up in US inventories that reinforced worries about the impact on demand from a global slowdown and trade frictions.The data reversed a rally of more than one percent in the commodity that came after Turkey launched an offensive against Kurdish militants in northern Syria.

She’s super proficient at it and super smart and everything else falls by the wayside. We get to see her stumble around and make mistakes.""Wright is a tough criminal court judge by day, but spends her off-time partying and being reckless. The character is involved in a casual relationship with psychiatrist and expert witness Gary Boyd, portrayed by Ryan Hansen.""There’s also a real fantasy element to [the series] in the sense that she kind of dispenses vigilante justice,"" Walsh continued. ""I think it’s really satisfying and funny for the audience to see, well, what would you do if you were a judge and you had that badge and you were in traffic and somebody’s annoying you, what could you get away with? If you could dispense any kind of sentencing that you want, what would you do if you got creative?""Bad Judge premiered Oct. 2, and airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC."

But since the announcement nearly a month ago, the NFL still hasn’t given a penny to the hotline.TMZ Sportslooked intothe announced partnership between the NFL and the National Domestic Violence Hotline and discovered the lack of funding.On September 19, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell made the announcement that the league had entered into “long-term partnerships to provide financial, operational and promotional support” for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center and the National Domestic Violence Hotline.But now, 25 days later, not a penny has been transferred from the NFL to the anti-violence organization.The CEO of the anti-violence group, Katie Ray-Jones, says that things are still moving forward in “good faith.” But it was also noted that the organization already hired 20 new employees expecting the money from the NFL to float their salaries.Clearly if the money doesn’t start rolling in soon, these people will lose their new jobs.The NFL has been mired in a wave of bad publicity with several players ending up being accused of beating up their wives or girlfriends. The most notorious case was that of Ravens player Ray Rice, who was eventuallycut from the teamand banned indefinitely from the NFL after video showed him hitting and knocking his then girlfriend unconscious in a New Jersey casino.But Rice isn’t the only player facing charges of violence. San Francisco 49ers playerRay McDonaldalso faces such charges. Others who face or have faces such charges include Greg Hardy (Panthers), A.J. Jefferson (Vikings), and Dez Bryant (Cowboys).Still, by some estimates, the problem with violence in the NFL isactually lowerthan that in the general population.Despite that finding, the NFL has been fighting this bad publicity for a month, publicity that its partnership with the anti-violence hotline was supposed to mitigate. The lag in fulfilling its promised donations are not helping the situation.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthustonor email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com"

7010936280,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/08/30/the-tide-of-history-is-with-brexit/,"Delingpole: Brexit Is Going to Happen, Whatever the Experts Say…","Remainer Conservatives like Anna Soubry are worried that the party is being infiltrated by right-wing entryists from UKIP and elsewhere and that this may lead to Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister and Britain securing full Brexit.Yes.That is the point, you pillocks.That is exactly what the majority of people want.If democracy means anything at all in Britain, then Theresa May must deliver on the promise made by her predecessor David Cameron and honour the decision made by 17.4 million people in the EU Referendum.That means: no Customs Union; no Single Market; no freedom of movement; no lunatic judicial interference from semi-literate Euro judges; no blood money; no Frenchmen nicking our fish — and absolute freedom to do whatever the hell we like politically and economically thereafter.But obviously she is not going to, as even her former handler Nick Timothy quietly concedes in hisDaily Telegraphcolumn.Nick Timothy is the senior prime ministerial advisor responsible for the extended suicide note — aka the last Conservative manifesto — that saw Theresa May lose her working majority in the last General Election. If even he has lost faith in her ability to deliver an effective Brexit — and clearly he has — then the writing must surely be on the wall for her tenure as Prime Minister.First, Timothy indicates why May’s useless Chequers Plan, sell-out though it is, is never going to find favour with the EU negotiators:But Chequers was never going to be acceptable to the EU, because it drives a coach and horses through its core principles. It seeks to cherry pick the rights ministers have decided they want – so far, de facto membership of the single market in goods – without accepting corresponding obligations, such as the free movement of people.Then, he indicates — albeit more politely than I’m about to — why the thick, stubborn, unimaginative May is completely lacking in the skills to extricate herself from this mess.The danger is that the PM,having expended so much political capital on Chequers, will feel unable to diverge from the course she has set. But even if she does, Remainers in the Cabinet, notably the Chancellor, will try to impose further compromises. If that happens, Britain’s negotiating position will be well understood in Brussels: any deal, we will be saying, is better than no deal.So what next?Timothy bores on, as so many political types do, about his preferred option. His is something called Canada Plus.But do we care?I don’t. Perhaps this makes me a bad person – or at least an unsophisticated person who doesn’t understand all the key issues or the electoral arithmetic or any of the other reasons regularly advanced by “experts” as to why we can’t get the Brexit for which we voted.It seems to me, though, that in my thinking I am much closer than these “experts” are to where the majority of people in Britain are.That is, we’ve been presented with this Gordian Knot which all the “experts” tell us is impossible to undo. And what we’re all thinking is: “Well sod that, then. Let’s just cut it!”Part of the problem, I think, is that the political class really haven’t learned the lesson we tried to teach them on June 24, 2016. Mentally they are still stuck in thestatus quo ante –that nannying, Social Democratic mindset which has dominated Western politics since the war whereby the political elite goes ahead and acts in its own interests while wearing the fig-leaf of democracy.What they haven’t understood is that we live in revolutionary times. See if you can spot what’s missing from the opening paragraphs of Nick Timothy’s piece:Remainers might not have noticed, but the European Union is suffering from a sickness that has grown worse since the Brexit vote two years ago. Hungary and Poland are governed by illiberal populists. The far-Right sits in governing coalitions in Austria and Italy.In 10 days, Right-wing populists are expected to surge in the Swedish elections. Nationalists have prospered in elections across Europe including the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands. And the trend is likely to continue this year and next in elections to national parliaments and the European Parliament.What’s absent, I think, is an understanding of the whereabouts of the right and wrong sides of history.Timothy, like so many in the Westminster bubble (see also the DC swamp), is on the wrong side.He views with abhorrence the “populist” revolutions taking place across Europe — and, by implication, the one in Trump’s United States — when in fact they are a vital and much-needed correction to decades of democratic deficit.History moves in waves. Run with them and you surge forward. Try to resist them and you simply get swamped or roiled or crushed.All those people who say Brexit (I refuse to use the term “hard Brexit” because it concedes the possibility that there might be any other acceptable kind) cannot be achieved because…fill in complex excuse here…are in serious danger of being on the wrong side of history.And I’m not saying it in that menacing way used by Marxist revolutionaries like Owen Jones. I don’t mean it as a threat, only as an observation.It has happened in the U.S.; it has happened in Italy and Hungary; it nearly happened in France — and may yet still, if these allegations of gay sado-masochistic affairs at, ahem, the highest levels of government are in any way accurate.If Brexit is what the people want — and they do — then Brexit is what they are going to get."

But her hard-hitting issues also forced Gov. Rauner to re-tool his campaign strategy and waste his own time and money replying to her charges.Rauner rushed to TV with an adaccusinghis primary opponent of taking money from the State’s powerhouse Democrat leader, House Speaker Mike Madigan (D-Chicago), and claimed she voted against property tax exemptions..The Ives campaignrepliedto the Rauner’s ad, calling its accusations nothing but “lies.”Ives points out that in their first meeting before theChicago Tribuneeditorial board, Rauner bragged about playing golf with Democrat majority leader Madigan, and insisted he knows Madigan very well.In a statement, Ives added:This ad is consistent with Rauner’s character. He is an unrepentant liar. If he’ll lie to Cardinal Cupich [about vetoing a pro-abortion bill he later signed], he’ll lie to anyone about anything. And in his three years as Governor, he has lied to everyone about everything.As State Representative and House Republican Floor Leader Peter Breen (R-Lombard) said after the last of Rauner’s many betrayals, HB 40, “Rauner’s promises were just flat out lies.”As Rep. David McSweeney (R-Barrington Hills) said, “Rauner has been completely ineffective – other than the TV ads and press releases he hides behind – in attempting to actually pass something. He could be the most ineffective politician in the country.”The Democrat Governors Association also took the occasion of Rauner’s ad against Ives to kick the governor while he’s down.Noting that Rauner thought “it was never supposed to get this far,” the DGA crowed that “Rauner now finds himself wasting time and resources running ads in a Republican primary.”The DGA pointedly added:“Thanks in part to Rauner’s unpopularity and ineptitude, Ives has kept rolling along. She racked up endorsements from numerous sitting legislators and county parties. She absolutely walloped Rauner in their only debate together. And Ives received $2.5 million from a Midwestern mega-donor that used to be a strong Rauner ally.”Rauner is counting on the state’s Republican establishment, and his own wealth, to bail him out. On Monday, Raunerclinchedthe endorsement of the Cook County Republican Party — the county the Democrat-dominated City of Chicago calls home.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthuston."

The senior was 5 of 7 for 104 yards and the go-ahead TD just before halftime.The Midshipmen (9-2, 7-1 AAC), who had already clinched the West Division title, had a season-high 496 yards rushing and their most points since scoring 76 against East Carolina in 2010. They have consecutive 60-point games for the first time since 1917. They will play USF or Temple next Saturday in the American Athletic Conference championship game.“This is exactly where we wanted to be. The entire offseason, this is what we worked for,” Worth said. “We feel great, just got to keep things rolling right now.”SMU (5-7, 3-5) missed a chance to become bowl eligible in its regular-season finale amid rumors coach Chad Morris is a candidate to become Baylor’s new coach. The Mustangs are 7-17 in two seasons under Morris, who took over after a 1-11 season.“This is not about me, this is about these kids in that locker room in there and moving forward,” Morris said. “I’m the football coach at SMU and I’m extremely excited about the direction of this program.”After Navy’s first lost fumble in five games led to a touchdown that put SMU up 24-21 late in the first half, the Midshipmen responded with 47 unanswered points.Worth’s 8-yard TD pass to Jamir Tillman with 6 seconds left in the first half put the Midshipmen ahead to stay. They then scored twice in less than a minute right after halftime, on 255-yard fullback Shawn White’s 50-yard run and Justin North’s 25-yard interception return.“I like where we are at,” coach Ken Niumatalolo said. “I just feel like we’re getting stronger as the season goes on, and it was all by design.”THE TAKEAWAYNavy: The Midshipmen, still in contention for a Cotton Bowl berth if they win the AAC title game, averaged 10.3 yards per rushing attempt and had six players rush for TDs. They have won four straight games. This was the 37th victory for the senior class, which still has three more games to play. They had matched last year’s seniors, who had tied the 36 wins by the Class of 1909.SMU: While a disappointing way to finish the season, the Mustangs have clearly improved under Morris. They had won three of four, including a win over Houston, before consecutive losses to AAC division leaders. Now they wait to see if Morris is back for a third season.UP NEXTNavy is in the AAC championship game next Saturday and then takes on Army on Dec. 10 in Baltimore.___More AP college football at www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"

Ron DeSantis’s administration are allegedly soliciting donations from lobbyists, according to reports.The allegationsstemfrom a May 25 article from NBC News, which said they have reviewed text messages from four DeSantis administration officials, “including those directly in the governor’s office and with leadership positions in state agencies.”According to the report, the officials asked lobbyists to contribute to DeSantis’s presidential campaign — which heformally kicked off on Wednesdayon Twitter — through a link. One anonymous lobbyist told the outlet that it appears the DeSantis administration is “keeping tabs on who is giving, and are doing it using state staff.” It is a bit unconventional, as administration staffers traditionally leave soliciting to the campaign side, creating a distance between the two facets of the candidate’s politicallife.Breitbart News reached out to both DeSantis’s office and his campaign for comment but did not receive a response.NBC, however, reported one administration official in the Executive Office of the Governor (EOG) who said they “wouldn’t be shocked if team eog somehow raised more money than lobbyists,” noting that they as well as others have personally donated to the governor’s campaign.“I’m not sure what every EOG staffer does on their free time and after hours, with their first amendment rights, but I wouldn’t be shocked if team eog somehow raised more money than lobbyists,” the staffer said.“I can confirm I (and many other staff) personally donated,” the individual added, according to NBC News.While it remains unclear if they are doing so on their personal time and on personal devices, some believe it would still pose an ethical dilemma, inquiring if such actions constitute what one attorney described as a “misuse of public position issue.”The report coincides with the DeSantis campaignpulling in$8.2 million in the first 24 hours of the governor’s presidential campaign, one million of which was raised one hour after the campaign launch.DeSantis campaign manager Generra Peck described the haul as “historic,” adding that it “shows that grassroots Republicans across the country are uniting behind Governor DeSantis’ vision for our Great American Comeback.”“Governor DeSantis has built the strongest, most sophisticated organization in the history of American politics, and the tremendous support we’ve experienced in the last 24 hours will be critical as we hit the ground running in the early nominating states to share Governor DeSantis’ plan to revitalize the American Spirit,” Peck added.DeSantis is expected tobegin his“campaign kickoff” in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday before visiting other cities in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.RELATED: Leftists and Right-Wing Protesters March Outside DeSantis Fundraiser in MiamiVideo Source: @tomaskenn via Storyful"

Earl Ray Tomblin activated 200 National Guard members to assist search and rescue centers in eight counties and is authorized to deploy at least 300 more. He also declared a state of emergency for 44 of the state’s 55 counties.“Together with the National Guard, our first responders, local emergency management officials and firefighters from across the state have been working around the clock, and we are deeply appreciative of their efforts.” Tomblin said.About 500 people were stranded at the Elkview Crossings Mall in Kanawha County for at least 24 hours starting on Thursday after a rain washed out a nearby bridge. Crews managed to create a temporary roadway out of gravel and some evacuated the area, while others decided to stay.The flooding also damaged homes throughout the state including carrying a burning home down Howard Creek in White Sulphur Springs near the southern part of the state.Gas lines in White Sulphur Springs were shut off as a precaution and the flooding left nearly 20,000 people without power, as of Friday night.Tomblin pleaded residents of the state to band together as the work to make it through the historic flooding.“Please continue to work together and support each other as West Virginians always do,” he said."

The embassy petitioned the government to block the demolition, but received no response.As per international law, embassies are considered the sovereign territory of the states they represent, meaning the Nigerian embassy would be considered Nigerian land. Ghana has a legal responsibility to protect the embassy and can only do away with it through the legal process of declaring Nigeria’s diplomatspersonae non grata, then formally withdrawing the diplomatic presence.“The receiving State is under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its dignity,” Article 22 of the Vienna Convention, which governs the treatment of embassies,reads. “The premises of the mission, their furnishings and other property thereon and the means of transport of the mission shall be immune from search, requisition, attachment or execution.”The facility’s head of security, Emmanuel Kabutey,said when police officers arrived at the scene, they did nothing to stop the demolition, which targeted a number of buildings under construction for embassy employees. Nigeria’s Charge D’affaires Iva Denoo was told she would need to leave the building or be bulldozed inside.“When the police came, with the bulldozer outside, they had a friendly chat with the leader of the bulldozing team, exchanged phone numbers with him, and allowed him to go,” he told local media.The demolition predictably drew a furiousresponsefrom Nigeria, one of the most powerful countries in Africa due to its large military and population of nearly 200 million people, which condemned it as an unprovoked “act of aggression.”“We strongly condemn two outrageous criminal attacks in Accra,Ghana, on a residential building in our diplomatic premises by unknown persons in which a bulldozer was used to demolish the building,” said Geoffrey Onyeama, Nigeria’s minister of foreign affairs. “We are engaging the Ghanaian Government and demand urgent action to find the perpetrators and provide adequate protection for Nigerians and their property in Ghana.”The shocking incident was seized upon by Ghana’s minority in Parliament, who released astatementdescribing themselves as “appalled and deeply embarrassed” by the demolition and accusing it of taking place “under the full protection of state security.”“The Minority forcefully condemns, in no uncertain terms, this reckless act of aggression which violates international law and gravely undermines Ghana’s longstanding diplomatic relations with Nigeria,” the statementread. “The Government of Ghana must not underestimate the implications of this reckless act of unprovoked aggression not only for Ghana-Nigeria relations but also the negative reverberations in larger diplomatic quarters.”On Tuesday, Ghanaian President Akufo-Addo called President Buhari to apologize for the incident and pledged to bring the culprits to justice.“Pres Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana today spoke with Pres Buhari, expressing his sincere apology for the demolition of a building on the premises of Nigerian High Commission in Accra, Ghana,” the Nigerian government wrote on Twitter.Relations between the two countries, which represent two of Africa’s largest economies, have in recent years been anything but smooth. Asnotedby the BBC, a dispute last year over the status of foreign traders led to the temporary closure of some Nigerian-owned businesses. Another source of tension centered around Nigeria’sdecisionto close its border with Benin in a supposed attempt to crack down on smuggling, but which had a considerable impact on Ghanaians and other foreign traders across the region.Follow Ben Kew onFacebook, Twitter at@ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com"

And understandably so. “Not in the mood” was the truly nauseating phrase used by the Deputy Speaker in parliament in order laughingly to explain why our elected representatives could scarcely be bothered to vote on some of the most dangerous legislation in British parliamentary history.The Coronavirus Act gives the Boris Johnson regime sweeping powers to do whatever the hell it likes under the pretext that Britain is experiencing a health crisis so catastrophic it justifies government by fiat.Yesterday, MPs had the opportunity to end this abuse of state power by voting against yet another six-month extension of the Coronavirus Act.Instead, the majority of MPs seem to treat this almost unprecedented erosion of liberty as one massive joke.Leading the laughter was Madam Deputy Speaker (Labour MP Dame Rosie Winterton)As if she were sharing some massive in-joke with fellow conspirators she leaned confidingly forward and said, smiling:‘The mood of the House is not to have a vote on this…’The House responded with gales of laughter.Why? What is so funny about not doing your job? (A job, which let us not forget, they are paid £81,000 a year, plus generous expenses, plus ring-fenced pension).And where do they think that this massive and unchecked expansion of the powers of the state is leading us?Do these buffoons imagine that because they are MPs they are and their families will somehow be protected from the tyranny they are helping to usher in?If they do, there’s a lovely bridge in Westminster, right next to Parliament, which I would more than happily sell them for an excellent price."

Steve Daines (R-MT) introduced legislation to protect Americans with guns traveling state to state.The other senators involved with the legislation are James Lankford (R-OK) and Mike Rounds (R-SD).The legislation bolsters theFirearm Owners Protection Actby adding protections for Americans who cross state lines from gun-friendly states to states that are less-gun friendly. To that end, the legislation seeks to ensure that law-abiding gun owners are not arrested for violation of local laws that center upon “the possession, transportation, or carrying of firearms.”There would be exceptions to the protection, as in a case where law enforcement has “probable cause.” But otherwise, the legislation seeks to lessen the hoops through which a law-abiding citizen must jump in order to travel with a gun.Daines said, “This is about protecting law abiding gun owners and their right to safely transport their firearms. Montanans want their 2ndAmendment rights protected and that’s what I’m fighting for.”NRA-ILA executive director Jason Ouimet said:Law-abiding Americans traveling with unloaded, secured firearms have continually been harassed with malicious arrests and prosecutions when traveling through anti-gun jurisdictions. Senator Daines’ legislation ensures such outrageous actions will no longer be tolerated under the law. On behalf of the NRA’s five million members, we thank Senator Daines for having the legislative courage to stand and fight against local bullies who were hoping to suppress our Second Amendment rights.Daines’ pro-gun efforts are joined by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID), James Lankford (R-OK), and Mike Rounds (R-SD).AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

This raises concern due to the apparent Border Patrol leadership’s strategy of only placing boots on the ground in high population areas; Border Patrol agents are often left alone in secluded areas to perform their duties and service in protecting America.Further concern is raised by Border Patrol plans to cut the work hours of many Border Patrol agents, reducing the protection by up to one-third in some places along the border. The National Border Patrol Council, a voluntary union advocating for border security and the border agents who keep us safe, has proposed the Border Patrol Pay Reform Act. They believe the legislation willstop the severe cutbacksto agents’ ability to properly secure the border and help reduce the dangers many of their agents face in remote areas.“Not only would our proposal save the tax-payers around $20 billion over ten years, but it is vital to reduce the risk of more of our Border Patrol agents being killed in remote areas as happened in this tragic and heartbreaking case,” said Border Patrol Council Vice-President Stu Harris of El Paso’s Local 1929. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to Agent Rosas’ family and we appreciate the hard work of the U.S. law enforcement community in bringing these killers to justice.”"

950239611,http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/DA2RR6900,Study contends Grand Canyon as old as dinosaur era,"(AP) Study contends Grand Canyon as old as dinosaur eraBy ALICIA CHANGAP Science WriterLOS ANGELESThe awe-inspiring Grand Canyon was probably carved about 70 million years ago, much earlier than thought, a provocative new study suggests _ so early that dinosaurs might have roamed near this natural wonder.Using a new dating tool, a team of scientists came up with a different age for the gorge’s western section, challenging conventional wisdom that much of the canyon was scoured by the mighty Colorado River in the last 5 million to 6 million years.Not everyone is convinced with the latest viewpoint published online Thursday in the journal Science. Critics contend the study ignores a mountain of evidence pointing to a geologically young landscape and they have doubts about the technique used to date it.The notion that the Grand Canyon existed during the dinosaur era is “ludicrous,” said geologist Karl Karlstrom of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.How the Grand Canyon became grand _ with its vertical cliffs and flat plateaus _ has been debated since John Wesley Powell navigated the whitewater rapids and scouted the sheer walls during his famous 1869 expedition.Some 5 million tourists flock to Arizona each year to marvel at the 277-mile-long chasm, which plunges a mile deep in some places. It’s a geologic layer cake with the most recent rock formations near the rim stacked on top of older rocks that date back 2 billion years.Though the exposed rocks are ancient, most scientists believe the Grand Canyon itself was forged in the recent geologic past, created when tectonic forces uplifted the land that the Colorado River later carved through.The new work by researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder and California Institute of Technology argued that canyon-cutting occurred long before that. They focused on the western end of the Grand Canyon occupied today by the Hualapai Reservation, which owns the Skywalk attraction, a horseshoe-shaped glass bridge that extends from the canyon’s edge.To come up with the age, the team crushed rocks collected from the bottom of the canyon to analyze a rare type of mineral called apatite. The mineral contains traces of radioactive elements that release helium during decay, allowing researchers to calculate the passage of time since the canyon eroded.Their interpretation: The western Grand Canyon is 70 million years old and was likely shaped by an ancient river that coursed in the opposite direction of the west-flowing Colorado.Lead researcher Rebecca Flowers of the University of Colorado Boulder realizes not everyone will accept this alternative view, which minimizes the role of the Colorado River.“Arguments will continue over the age of Grand Canyon, and I hope our study will stimulate more work to decipher the mysteries,” Flowers said in an email.It’s not the first time that Flowers has dug up evidence for an older Grand Canyon. In 2008, she authored a study that suggested part of the eastern Grand Canyon, where most tourists go, formed 55 million years ago. Another study published that same year by a different group of researchers put the age of the western section at 17 million years old.If the Grand Canyon truly existed before dinosaurs became extinct, it would have looked vastly different because the climate back then was more tropical. Dinosaurs that patrolled the American West then included smaller tyrannosaurs, horned and dome-headed dinosaurs and duckbills.If they peered over the rim, it would not look like “the starkly beautiful desert of today, but an environment with more lush vegetation,” said University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz.Many scientists find it hard to imagine an ancient Grand Canyon since the oldest gravel and sediment that washed downstream date to about 6 million years ago and there are no signs of older deposits. And while they welcome advanced dating methods to decipher the canyon’s age, Karlstrom of the University of New Mexico does not think the latest effort is very accurate.Karlstrom said it also defies logic that a fully formed canyon would sit unchanged for tens of millions of years without undergoing further erosion.Geologist Richard Young of the State University of New York at Geneseo said his own work suggests there was a cliff in the place of the ancient Grand Canyon.Flowers “wants to have a canyon there. I want to have a cliff there. Obviously, one of us can’t be right,” he said.Whatever the age, there may be a middle ground, said Utah State University geologist Joel Pederson.Researchers have long known about older canyons in the region cut by rivers that flow in a different direction than the Colorado River. It’s possible that a good portion of the Grand Canyon was chiseled long ago by these smaller rivers and then the Colorado came along and finished the job, he said.___Online:Science: http://www.sciencemag.org___Follow Alicia Chang at http://twitter.com/SciWriAlicia"

The program aims to provide F-15 Eagles with an updated electronic warfare system, which BAE System officials say is essential for ensuring the aircraft are equipped to meet emerging threats.“Recognizing the importance of providing this enhanced EW technology to our warfighters, our team responded during the first phase of the program by not only meeting all set program milestones, but in some cases exceeding expectations by several weeks,” BAE Systems Electronic Combat Solutions general manager Brian Walters said in a press release.The F-15 Eagle was originally designed and developed by McDonnell Douglas to support air supremacy missions in 1967, taking first flight in 1972. After merging with Boeing, the company’s aircraft has been sold to six countries. In addition to the U.S. Air Force, primary users include the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, the Royal Saudi Air Force, and the Israeli Air Force. None have announced plans to retire the aircraft from service.Industry partners began the F-15 modernization program in 2008 when developers began installing the U.S.-made electronic warfare system. The equipment supports both offensive and defensive capabilities, and can help pilots detect incoming threats with a fully integrated radar warning feature."

Simpson won a small victory Wednesday in his bid for freedom as Nevada granted him parole on some of his 2008 convictions for kidnapping and armed robbery involving the holdup of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas hotel room. But the decision doesn’t mean Simpson will be leaving prison anytime soon. The former NFL star was convicted on multiple charges and still faces at least four more years behind bars on sentences that were ordered to run consecutively. The Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners released its decision in favor of Simpson’s parole request Wednesday. Commissioners noted Simpson’s “positive institutional record” and his participating in programs addressing “behavior that led to incarceration.”The parole becomes effective Oct. 2. Then, Simpson will begin serving the minimum term on four concurrent sentences imposed for using a weapon during the 2007 robbery. He will have another parole hearing on those sentences in a year. After that, he has two more consecutive terms for assault with a deadly weapon, said David Smith, spokesman for the board. The board noted Simpson had no previous criminal convictions and still has consecutive sentences to serve. Simpson was tried for murder but acquitted in Los Angeles for the 1994 death of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.Simpson appeared before a two-member Nevada parole panel last Thursday to plead for leniency. He expressed regret for his actions and said he’s tried to be a model inmate while behind bars. Lovelock Correctional Center officials say he’s had no disciplinary actions against him. Simpson was convicted in December 2008 on charges including kidnapping, robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to nine to 33 years for the 2007 stick up of two memorabilia dealers, Alfred Beardsley and Bruce Fromong. Simpson still faces time for four weapon enhancement sentences, following by consecutive terms for two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. During last week’s parole hearing, a graying Simpson told Parole Commissioner Susan Jackson and hearing officer Robin Bates, a retired Nevada prison warden, that he was sorry for his actions."

They hunt elephants,” wildlife department chief Abdul Kadir Abdul Hashim told AFP.“There are maybe two more (poaching) groups (in the area). We are working together with the police on this.”A police statement said weapons including rifles and homemade shotguns as well as animal snares were found after they arrested the gang.The elephant’s tusks were not found, with a wildlife official believing that they were already sold.He added that the gang — all locals — were believed to have been operating since 2009, and were also active in the nearby state of Kelantan.The arrests come a year after a seven-man gang was arrested in Kelantan, with explosives, guns and parts of tusks seized.Elizabeth John, senior communications officer of wildlife trade watchdog Traffic Southeast Asia, hoped to see more busts like these in the future.“The seizure of high powered weapons clearly shows what wildlife and other authorities are up against,” she said.There are believed to be some 1,200 wild Asian elephants in peninsular Malaysia, down from as many as 1,700 in 2011.Though endangered and protected by law, many of these pachyderms have been hunted for their ivory, which can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market."

He had shared the British Grand Prix record of wins, on five, with fellow-Briton Jim Clark and Frenchman Alain Prost.Daniel Ricciardo was seventh for Renault ahead of Kimi Raikkonen of Alfa Romeo, Daniil Kvyat in a Toro Rosso and Nico Hulkenberg in a Renault.“What a day,” said Hamilton. “To all the crowd, thank-you so much for coming out.”Hamilton, who stopped on his slow-down lap to collect a British ‘Union Jack’ flag, added: “I love you Silverstone. I appreciate everything and the opportunity to be a part of this.“I couldn’t have done this without these guys or without my team.”A glum Bottas said: “Congrats to Lewis…It wasn’t my day.”A much happier Leclerc said: “It’s probably the race I’ve enjoyed the most in my career.”The safety car was deployed when Antonio Giovinazzi spun into a gravel trap in his Alfa Romeo – gifting Hamilton a ‘free’ first, and only, pit stop. The luckless Bottas, on a two stop strategy, had already pitted before the incident.On an overcast and cool afternoon, Justin Whiting, the 12-year-old son of the late Charlie Whiting, the official Race Director who died suddenly in Melbourne in March, started the race. before a crowd of 141,000 at Silverstone.As the lights went out, the Mercedes pair pulled clear, Hamilton chasing Bottas throughout the first lap ahead of Leclerc and Verstappen with Vettel fifth.– Oozing confidence –By lap 10, the lead was three-tenths, Hamilton oozing confidence could not pass Bottas slithering to protect his lead. Behind them, Leclerc blocked attacks from Verstappen.But on lap 17, Bottas came in for a new set of mediums and Hamilton inherited the lead ahead of Vettel, the pair delaying their stops as long as possible. Then Giovinazzi beached his Alfa Romeo at Club.Hamilton took advantage and pitted for hards, followed by Vettel and Verstappen, making a second stop. Ferrari, reacting slowly, called in Leclerc, who emerged  sixth behind Gasly and Verstappen. All this left Hamilton leading Bottas with Vettel third.Racing resumed on lap 23, the field, backed up by Hamilton, swarming like bees at the re-start.Bottas, on mediums, traded fastest laps with Hamilton, knowing he had to make a second stop. Verstappen, helped by quick thinking from Red Bull, rose to fourth when Gasly moved over on Hangar Straight and began his pursuit of Vettel.The Dutchman caught and passed him at Stowe only for the German to ram into the rear end of the 007-branded Red Bull, who had Bond actor Daniel Craig in their garage, both spinning into the gravel but surviving to re-join the fray.A stewards’ investigation followed, but both races were compromised.Leclerc rose to third and Gasly to fourth. Verstappen regained fifth while Vettel pitted for a new nose, fell to 17th and was then given a 10-seconds time penalty.With eight laps remaining, Hamilton was told to pit, but ignored the call, persuading Mercedes to bring in Bottas for softs, a tilt at fastest lap and a secure run to the flag."
