The group’s Facebook announcement says:Donald J. Trump has made headlines in recent months with his divisive rhetoric, hate speech, and extremist plans to “make America great again”. We, in fact, believe this will do the opposite to this nation. Trump’s policy threatens many of us in the Black, Latino, LGBT, Muslim, and other communities. These policies and this type of speech has no place in this country, and certainly does not have a place in the city that Trump grew his empire in, which is considered such a melting pot and home for many of the same people Trump continues to wage war on. Join us at Columbus Circle as we march to Trump Tower as we say no to hate, no to divisiveness, no to fascist policies, and most importantly, no to Donald J. Trump.The Cosmopolitan Antifascists are soccer fans, working in solidarity with English groups who combine pro-leftist sentiments with the sport. New York City has a professional soccer team called the New York Cosmos, although the group says it is not directly affiliated with the team.The invite for the event leads to theFacebook page of Nathen Taylor, a nose ring-wearing man who says he previously worked atSaatchi & Saatchi Londonand who currently works as a digital designer atLeicester City Football Club.
