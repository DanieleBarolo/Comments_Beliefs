  "article_body": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) is trying to regain credibility with the conservative base by helping Sens. Ted Cruz (R-FL), Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) with their effort to defund Obamacare in the upcoming Continuing Resolution (CR), but Tea Party activists are still placing pressure on the junior Senator.\u201cAmid a smattering of boos and yells of \u2018no amnesty,\u2019 Sen. Marco Rubio waded through a rowdy summer-recess crowd on Friday where he tried to focus more on the push to defund ObamaCare than the ongoing debate over immigration legislation,\u201dFox News\u2019 Serafin Gomez reportsfrom Orlando\u2019s Americans for Prosperity Summit.During his remarks, Gomez notes, \u201cRubio made no mention of immigration legislation that has irked some in the audience\u2013including a group of elderly women from New Mexico who were wearing \u2018Pink Slip Rubio\u2019 buttons.\u201dTheWashington Post\u2018s Matea Goldreportsthat Rubio \u201cdid not acknowledge\u201d the heckling crowd and did not directly address immigration legislation before Congress.ThePostquoted a couple Tea Party activists in the crowd disappointed by Rubio\u2019s performance in Washington.\u201cI\u2019d like to see Marco Rubio, just so I can tell him what I think of his positions: He\u2019s on the wrong track of being a conservative,\u201d Rick Barr, an activist from Indianapolis, told Gold.\u201cWe\u2019re all a little irritated with Marco,\u201d Judy Peterson, an activist and retired special education teacher, said, according to Gold. \u201cNow, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve thrown him under the bus. But we would like him to, just come on. He hasn\u2019t explained it very well.\u201dThe continued pressure from the conservative base against Rubio comes as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), an opponent of the immigration legislation that Rubio shepherded through the Senate,predictedHouse Majority Leader John Boehner will lose his Speakership if he allows the Senate bill or anything like it to become law.\u201cIf he allows something to pass out of conference that looks anything like the Senate bill and is passed with a majority of Democrats, I think that will be the final thing he does as speaker,\u201d Paul said on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio program on Friday. \u201cSo, I think he knows that, and I think he\u2019s going to be very cautious, and I hope he will defend us on this and not pass something that looks like the Senate bill.\u201d",

Every single Mexican that came into this country violated our laws and they are CRIMINALS.\n\n\nThey currently send billions of dollars back to Mexico and it will get worse. Not only that Mexicans will bring the evils of Mexico with them and that means more crime and poverty.\n\n\nWe don't owe them a damn thing. Go back to your own country!",

Oh, there's also the free phones. Mexico is \nrich in natural resources but there's grinding poverty because of the corrupt \ngovernment with only a few oligarch families controlling the country's wealth.\nMore than half of Mexican citizens either uneducated or lack education.\nAnd these are the Mexicans who have invaded and are still invading our \ncountry and demanding AMNESTY. And our politicians are determined \nare determined to give it to every single invader.",
