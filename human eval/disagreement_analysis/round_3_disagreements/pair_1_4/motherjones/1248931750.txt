well, the joke of the autism crap is that the medical definition/diagnosis for autism changed and became broader a decade or so ago(when the nutjobs began fearing inoculations for causing autism, AIUI) which increased the numbers of individuals diagnosed as autistic.  its all a bunch of mumbo jumbo and fake science that has been debunked time and again that vaccinations cause autism.  that you are gullibly stupid to believe it is a problem, but given the assault on education and Science in the last 30-50 years, that you are a gullible idiot is unsurprising, sad; but unsurprising.

It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

This article perpetuates numerous myths to the general detriment of our children.

MYTH #1: If your kid is vaccinated, he or she can catch diseases from non-vaccinated children:  this makes no sense. If your child is vaccinated, you should have no concern, right?

MYTH #2: Vaccines do not cause autism. Proof this is not true #1: If this was true, why did the government pass a law saying you can't sue vaccine companies? Proof this is not true #2:  there is no proof, just numerous papers insisting there is proof = rhetoric. If you can find actual proof vaccines don't cause autism, you are the first.  Proof this is not true #3:  vaccine companies are removing the mercury from vaccines. Why would they do this if it was not poisonous? However, even without it, vaccines still have arsenic and many other deadly poisons. Proof this is not true #4:  even if these contain 'trace amounts,' children today have to take numerous more vaccines than ever before, many for illnesses that can be cured with pencillin:  taking many at once is not a "trace" amount. Skyrocketing autism rates in children must have a cause. Proof this is not true #4: in medical school, they do tell doctors that vaccines cause autism, but that the lobbyists are too powerful to do anything about it. Most doctors snooze through this lesson, and don't even remember it: do they care?

MYTH #3: You and the government have the right to tell people they must risk autism and vaccinate their child. If your child cannot get ill from my child, then the answer is no. The government also shouldn't have the right to enforce that you can't sue vaccine companies, but then force you to take medicine. You can get an exemption for religious reasons, and that is YOUR RIGHT. Others do not have the right to say otherwise, and because they have made it so difficult to get out of vaccines, are implicit in causing skyrocketing autism rates, often among their own children.
