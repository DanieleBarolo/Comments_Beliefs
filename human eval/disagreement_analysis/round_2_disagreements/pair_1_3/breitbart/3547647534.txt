Too true and with an open border with Mexico, which is all but a failed state now, automatic weapons are the least of all things coming across into America. RPG's, mortars, ground to air missiles have all been stopped . ... .. ..  so far . .. .. . but you have to wonder what else has crossed and not been stopped. The democrats will affect legal sales and legal ownership while the bad guys will, as you said, get their hands on banned weapons easily.

Trump has been trying to help protect us from this and liberals have overuled him at every step.

The Sudanese immigrant who shot up a White Christian Church in Tennessee, now we see this horrific attack.

You liberal sanctuary city appeasers are to blame for this carnage!

The 9th Circuit should feel proud they stopped our President from protecting our homeland.

Sickening!!

PARENT COMMENT:
Fully automatic rifles are illegal, but "illegal" doesn't stop the crazies or the bad guys or the terrorists from getting their hands on those weapons and using them.

Soon we will be seeing democrat notables like Pelosi or Schumer or Clinton demanding 'gun control'. They should be reminded that America cannot have gun control as long as the southern border remains open. CLOSE THE BORDER! Then have an intelligent, informed discussion about gun control and if it will help stop this kind of mass shootings.
