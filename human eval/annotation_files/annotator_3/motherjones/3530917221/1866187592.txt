Yes, maybe- I don't watch TV very often as I don't own an idiot box, but it is not entertainment.

      I do try to be tactful and sensitive to the feelings of our conservative brethren who may listen to Mr. O'Reilly . I certainly wouldn't want to offend any of those nimrods .

              Okay.  I agree. I don't have the problem with FOX that a lot of people have.  They push their agenda every day as EVERY news organization does, however, every now and then they get something right. lol!

I find it funny as hell that Bill O'Reilly talked about Brian Williams like a dog, while knowing all along that he also embellished stories.  LOL!!  You can't make this sh!t up!!!

He's now caught in the same quagmire as Brian Wiliams!  There IS a GOD!!!!  LOL!  God is good; God is kind.

Six month suspension or OFF WITH HIS HEAD!

                  They aren't lying about facts they just have wacko opinions about said facts, nothing in politics is black and white enough to lie about

                    they flat out lie. And they do it with no apparent remorse....for money. They lie by not telling facts, and they lie by omitting things that are needed in order to make a logical conclusion. They abuse the nation when they do it too.


There was a time, before Reagan when conservatives valued important things.....and would never have supported foreigners owning and controlling what they call news. We should go back to that

                      I am sorry, wasn't Brian Williams just suspended for lying?  Wasn't Dan Rather removed for fabricating documents?  wasn't a columnist  recently removed at the New York times for making stuff up?

                        Not sure I get your point? Did I say he wasn't or anything about him? Did I defend him, say he should not have been removed? Did I advocate for him to get his job back? Please explain what you want me to respond to


Has O'Reilly been removed?


And no Rather did not fabricate documents.....what he was given were copies of documents that he was told were the real ones. It was already common knowledge that bush is a deserter, and Rather was set up as a bait and switch to take the attention off bush's failure to report to duty. I don't know what experience you have with the military, but physicals for pilots are not optional and reporting for duty is mandatory.


What I said about FOX is accurate. What I have said about the news being the who, what, when and where is also the truth.

                          Fox loves all you Fox haters. By watching to hate, you are helping the ratings! Thanks.

                            We do not hate FOX, they actually make very good shows, entertainment shows. The unfortunate part is their news show also is entertainment. Good old Gaius Julius said it, "bread and circuses. "  It works.
