most americans have to live far out in the suburbs if a middle class american wants to buy a home they will inevitably live outside of the dense urban core where their jobs are thus longer commutes if you are willing or prefer to rent you have more flexibility in where you can live because you don't have to finance for your downtown residence you simply bight off a month in rent the exceptions to this appear to be san francisco where long term owners inside the city have manipulated the market so that young newcomers who are more likely to rent don't have housing options inside the city and have to live in the suburbs and the upper midwest where inner city housing values are low and lower middle class families can afford homes downtown"", ""i have worked directly with homeless programs for a couple of decades and have a few observations there needs to be more people involved in the decision making process who are not homeless advocates hud gave the advocates control of funding through the continuum of care funding process the advocates are subject to group think ideology and conflicts of interest they shut down discussions that are not aligned with their views there needs to be more input from people who are homeless about the type housing they want the advocates are too focused on redeeming people and trying to take people who have long term mental illness substance abuse issues misa and turning them into sober minimum wage workers living in one bedroom suburban apartments many of the homeless do not want this lifestyle it is common for chronic homeless to be placed in housing and then reject it for life on the streets many of the homeless cannot give up abusing substances part of the issue is designing the physical housing in a format that they will stay housed for instance group housing may be preferable to a traditional apartment a second part of the issue is the rules for instance do you allow the homeless to have friends spend the night do you allow them to drink smoke etc a related issue is the cost of housing and servicing the homeless the models used by the advocates results in extremes on one hand the advocates are spending large sums on housing and services i can cite examples of cities spending around per studio apartment plus they provide all sorts of services that may or may not be welcomed because they spend so much money on some people there are a large number of people who then end up in horrible emergency shelters if new models were adopted the cities could house significantly more people with less on going service cost the programs need to be simplified and provided more universally there are so many rules and regulations it makes it hard to qualify people and keep them housed in regards to locations historically a lot of homeless were day workers who lived next to industrial areas i don't see why the housing could not be moved to a commercial industrial location"", ""while not on the top largest only about population portland or just up the road for san francisco is facing a crisis situation with regards to housing and homelessness rents here are rising faster than anywhere in the nation while wages on average for most residents are low as i have mentioned in other comments to stories on housing issues rental management companies and independent landlords have been jacking rents up or more between tenancies the metro area is caught in what could become a housing pressure cooker by a strict urban growth boundary as the population is expected to grow by over in the next two decades mostly by relocation that is more than the city's current population as demand begins to encroach on supply and ins some cases it is beginning to do so prices will continue to rise leaving many low and fixed income out in the cold literally currently low income people are being displaced from the close in neighbourhoods to the outlying burbs by the effects of gentrification and upscale development which increases overall housing costs the upward march in rents is now even creping into these areas as well threatening to push people even further out or out on the street in one outlying community hillsboro it has already happened developments built along the lrt lines to encourage taking transit over driving are in many cases financially out of reach of the people for whom transit is the only way to get on with life in one inner se portland neighbourhood bus frequency on one line has been increased several times however the average rents along the line are pretty much beyond what of most who work in the restaurants boutiques and pubs along the street could afford a news article a year or so ago pointed to interests outside the state one of which based in silicon valley that are looking to buy up homes in the inner neighbourhoods to rent primarily to upwardly mobile professionals who would telecommute this will only make the current bad situation worse as it will spark further inflation of housing prices and rents meanwhile those on low and fixed incomes are being shoved out to the outskirts where one pretty much needs a car because of poor transit frequency and schedules greater distances to jobs and services like shopping schools or clinics as well as lack of sidewalks and crosswalks in many areas many of the rental units in these areas are those cheaply built prefab s types with insufficient insulation poor if any weatherisation and inefficient electric baseboard heating that can make utility bills in the winter almost as expensive as the rent a number of these places are also poorly maintained by the owners as well with mould being a major health issue one more aspect that is taking away what little affordable housing are regulations and taxes that make splitting a home into multiple rental units more expensive for example city codes now require two exits for emergency escape most older homes do not have that so they need to be modified to comply at the owner's expense i lived in such a unit part of the property tax code also makes it more expensive to rent out a home particularly if it is divided into multiple units so many owners are finding it better to just sell the house outright rather then continue renting it particularly as the housing market here is in a boom phase again in their quest to promote portland as a progressive green and liveable community the city administration and metro are making it increasingly unliveable for the many who have celled the portland home for decades if not their entire lives""]"

god has put you in this place at this time to do just that these unprecedented circumstances demand an unprecedented and multilayered forensic audit process we have witnessed politicians across our nation attempt to pacify the people with incomplete incompetently handled audits the only path forward is to enlist multiple independent highly experienced professional auditors such as allied security operations group and tesla laboratories to audit the dominion voting systems machines as well as the physical ballots themselves to date a complete unbiased forensic physical ballot audit has never been undertaken in good faith anywhere in the country the closest we came was in when physical ballots with hanging chads were visually inspected by humans for kinematic artifacts identifying and examining kinematic artifacts was the standard then and should be the standard even more so today tremendous technological advancements have been made in the detection of kinematic artifacts recently there have been ballot counts both by machine and hand but as you are no doubt aware by now the scope of ballot fraud has extended far beyond what merely counting the number of ballots can detect the same kinematic artifact technology that is presently utilized to identify counterfeit currency banknotes bonds stocks and passports must be used to examine the last thing each voter had in their hand when they voted their physical ballot the latest technology which can verify a minimum of validation points on each ballot has been made available to you for this forensic audit computer driven kinematic artifact technology can result in an entirely unbiased audit all human opinion is removed as computer vision machine learning and artificial intelligence can now examine and flag problematic ballots as they are scanned just as the original paper ballots were audited in for kinematic artifacts our physical paper ballots must also be forensically audited for kinematic artifacts to verify their authenticity kinematic artifact examination is a proven process that has been utilized in various fields for decades with the technology at our fingertips today we can finally reach a quick thorough and unbiased audit determination beyond contestation your constituents will accept nothing less future election integrity and voter security cannot remain compromised we will not trust the voting machines az selected we will not trust the ballots nor will we trust those we elect now or in the future you our presently elected legislative members have been given the opportunity to do

trailblazers"", ""it would seem that the arizona forensic audit of its own election results is an integral part of the arizona voting process and according to article i section clause and the

is happening here and isn't that what wendy is saying now if the state fails in its attempts to keep its own elections fair honest and orderly then i suspect the us congress and perhaps scotus not the executive branch would be legally allowed to step in but they haven't have they in fact they both seem to be complicit in the alleged election fraud of how amazing is that perhaps the feds and us all should simply wait until the arizona audit results are known before we get our panties in a twist forensic audits are usually pretty good and pretty thorough in determining the truth in cases especially in cases where fraud may be involved the other interesting aspect of this arizona audit is that several other states have now expressed interest in knowing what was happening with the audit and have visited the arizona audit facility is an election overrule landslide coming i have long thought the problem with election fraud started when open and public elections were made secret and private also when voting in elections became primarily electronic rather than audit able and manually counted paper votes election fraud became an instant winner the problems with electronic voting systems are legend by the way why is there always the mandatory same day election results declaration why isn't election auditing done before a state declares a winner isn't this especially important in both state and federal elections why do any states allow their election results to be declared before the votes have been verified by forensic auditors so what if it takes weeks to declare an
