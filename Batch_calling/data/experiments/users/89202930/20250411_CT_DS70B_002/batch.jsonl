Some states held out against it for years, especially Arizona (which held out for 17 years). What ultimately brought them into it was because local hospitals were getting stuck with the bills for poor and indigent patients and going bankrupt - and this was <em>before</em> the EMTALA Act in the 1980s that mandated emergency treatment for walk-in patients regardless of insured status.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nYou have no idea what this article is about, do you?

Our gov is supposed to work for the people not for their big donors who control the government at our expense. It's because of people like Bernie that things will change now and it's because of people like you that things just get worse because you promote sitting on your thumbs and waiting at your own expense. So what your point is is that you need to sell your soul to get change which discredits your point that everything is so perfect here. The bottom line is our government is working for big money to exploit us while you are telling me that I should just wait around for things to change eventually by corrupt people who have no desire nor the backbone to stand up to their sponsors who control them. You are a status quo coward just like the rest of the people who are still waiting for change that will never happen because of cowards like you who try to dissuade us from the change we need now.\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHave you forgotten Congress?

Assuming HRC wins the Presidency, then coming up to 2020, the presidency will have been with the Ds for 12 years, something which hasn't happened since FDR.\n2. If the Rs completely obstruct (again) there is a fair chance that the economy will continue to be lukewarm, making an argument for 'change'.\n3. Most important - PAUL RYAN HAS TO WIN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.  As we've all seen, you don't get anywhere in a Republican primary by being seen as a 'squish' or a 'RINO'.  Ryan will win the R primary by running as the hero who tried his best to stop HRC enacting her marxist, socialist etc etc agenda.  I can't see a scenario where Ryan (or anyone) 'gets the tea parties under control'.  The 'lesson' that the Rs have learned from EVERY election loss is that they weren't conservative ENOUGH.  \n\nTrump will be blamed for being a nutbag, not for being too conservative.  Ryan's calculus will be that playing to the base for the next 3 years is the only way to get the Republican nomination, and a chance at running on a 'nostalgia for Reagan' ticket.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nSorry, Kevin, I completely disagree with you here.  Ryan certainly is interested in running for President.  Consider this : \n\n1. Assuming HRC wins the Presidency, then coming up to 2020, the presidency will have been with the Ds for 12 years, something which hasn't happened since FDR.\n2. If the Rs completely obstruct (again) there is a fair chance that the economy will continue to be lukewarm, making an argument for 'change'.\n3.
