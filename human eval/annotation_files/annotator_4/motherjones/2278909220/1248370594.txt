EGGsactly.  You see, using only free range organic eggs as the basis for the vaccine you create really expensive vaccines that these kinds of people will consume gleefully.  This is NOT a problem, this is a capitalist opportunity.  In fact, I can't believe this isn't already being done.

It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

I've got a solution to all this.  Free range vaccinations. No, Organic Vaccinations.
Hear me out.  This is clearly a fad.  To counter a fad, you create a new one.  Then you make it hip to join in on the craze.  In other words, you don't  ram the horse's head into the water trough, you make it think that the water is tainted by pixie dust and stand back while the horses fight over it.
