What is wrong with everyone? The NFL insults you all, but you continue to watch it. MSM continues to support Hillary with your \"bundled\" cable/satellite and you pay for it. Jackazzez like Kaepernick give you the finger and all you do is complain. \n\nYou are paying the bill. You are responsible for the reprehensible behavior of MSM in general and the NFL in particular. \n\nWhy can't you stop watching and paying for cable for a few months to deprive the enemy of their passage way into your heads and households? Do you really want our country destroyed so badly because you can't do without TV for a while?\n\nNo wonder Hillary has so much support. It's so disgusting. \n\nStop complaining about the media or the NFL. Watch your football and eat crow--that's what you want; that's what you're paying for.\n\nIncredible. So many American parents can't discipline themselves and stand up to their kids by cutting the cable.\n\nNo guts. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the games! Hillary, Obama, the Dems, MSM and the Establishment will take care of the rest. Don't bother to exercise your 2nd Amendment rights if you don't have the backbone to stand up to the cable companies and the NFL. Buy plastic squirt guns and have fun during commercials and half-time. The government knows what to do with the weapons you own that you think will protect you, yet the enemy is in your living room and probably two or three or more places in your house--right next to you.\n\nSkip Hillary's inauguration on Jan. 20 and instead plan your Feb. 7th Super Bowl party.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThis is the biggest load of BS that I have ever seen. The NFL as turned into a Marxist organization who thinks they are bulletproof.

They allowed Beyonce to protest police officers while paying tribute to BLM and the Black Panthers.\n\nThe NFL is a racist organization that openly advocates violence against law enforcement and now is openly choosing to oppose the US.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nTypical DimocRAT response when they have nothing else.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

In another couple of decades they will overtake the indigenous population, who will, in time, become an ethnic minority in their own country.\n\nIf the British state had, using mass immigration, social engineering and population control, done that to a foreign country, the left would be up in arms accusing them of ethnic cleansing. Because that's what it is.\n\nThe state basically has only one job: defending the nation. That's what we've entrusted it to do. It's done the very opposite. \n\nDon't assume the state cares about the nation, and is only ever incompetent when it fails. You don't end up an ethnic minority in your own country in a few decades unless the people in power have planned your eradication.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nPressure from students?

Years ago, I catered sets for two weeks before i got a real job again in hollywood, one day for Ellen.  She for sure rolled with a group of pretentious butt kissers who treated us day player workers like the help, and they were famous with her.  I don't remember Ellen being horrible, but the people around her were you typical losers who sucked off her fame like they had her talent too.
