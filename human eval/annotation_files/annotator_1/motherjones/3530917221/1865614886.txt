I was in Jerusalem during the intifada. That makes me a combat veteran.

Wow....I always hated Bill O'Reilly but I would've never accused him of being THIS bad until now

One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .

PARENT COMMENT:
I was in Antrim in the 80s... does that make me a veteran? I guess if I was Bill O'Reilly it would.

ROFL, that he calls Northern Ireland a "war zone" should have been a red flag. Even at the height of the Troubles it wasn't a "war zone." 

O'Reilly is a typical chicken hawk. It's hilarious.
