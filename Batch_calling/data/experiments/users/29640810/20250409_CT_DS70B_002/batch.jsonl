It is irreversible.  We get some into programs that can teach them coping mechanisms, but those programs are terribly unproductive - in contrast to residential programs for 'mere' heroin or crack addiction.  \n\nAs a defense lawyer, I despair when I represent 14 year old children who are being pimped out by their dealers in exchange for drugs.  Dealers target them, becase children, especially troubled children, are vulnerable easy profits for them.\n\nI am also troubled when dealers target people with psychiatric illnesses (because they have disability incomes, and they too are vulnerable), - and their issues very quickly are compounded beyond the capacity of medical science to address.\n\nHowever, if someone is older than the age of majority, is not being victimized because of psychiatric disability, is not responsible for the care and upbringing of children, and is not subject to a whole list of other caveats. -  I really don't care if they destroy their lives.  That's freedom.\n\nHowever, from my 3 decades of working with addicts, I realize that someone I know on a first name basis, will be dead next week.  Another three or four children will end up in foster care h/II .... and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nI work with a dedicated, compassionate group of people that are fighting a losing battle against this catastrophe - and we don't have time for sophistry and wishful thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Well they should read the Koran because it's all there in black and white, or even read some history, I suggest  Prime Minister W.E Gladstone's famous quote about the Koran: \"there will be no peace on earth while that accursed book exists\"  (read David Vincent's book \"2030: Your Children's Future in Islamic Britain\" Amazon and Kindle). Our children are being ritually slaughtered by a religion they are told means \"peace\" in our schools. They are being raped by members of the same religion while being told in school that all religions and cultures are the same. They will be enslaved by a religion they are told wants to co-exist and assimilate, by their Marxist teachers in our diverse schools. Missing from the  school curriculum is the fact that Islam comes into the Christian West at the point of a sword, but lately in rubber dinghies provided by George Soros and the EU, then drives out the indigenous population through terror and violence. The Middle East was once Christian and Jewish, Istanbul was Constantinople, the epicentre of a Christian culture and religion, do we really think that Islam has changed its aims of world domination and conquest and genocide? If we teach about the Nazis in our schools why is an ideology with precisely the same aims being ignored? Nobody ever votes in the Muslims, they come to kill then colonize as they have done for 1400 years.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI too am full of loathing for the \"Losers\".  But I don't think it appropriate to suggest harming civilians.  \n\nHowever, anyone know why N EMP could not be used on Raqqa?  \n\nFry every last radio, computer, car electronics etc.  No communications in or out.  No battlefield communications.  No driving of ammunition and water.   Seems it would be a lot less resistance from the Losers if they couldn't co-ordinate anything.   \n\nNot to mention a subtle hint about how things are going to go down, if they don't put their hands up.\n\nCertainly a modest and prudent use of Nuclear armament.

WHAT GLOBAL WARMING?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nFrom NASA: Long cold winter could hit space in months bringing record low temperatures, NASA has warned.\n\nThat's the warning from a scientist who fears sunspot activity on the surface of our star has dropped so low that record low temperatures could soon set in.\n\n\u201cWe see a cooling trend,\u201d says Martin Mlynczak of NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center.\n\n\u201cHigh above Earth\u2019s surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy.\n\n\"If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for cold.\u201d\n\nSolar minimum can enhance the effects of space weather, disrupt communications and navigation, and even cause space junk to \"hang around\", NASA said.\n\nMlynczak and his colleagues have recently introduced the \"Thermosphere Climate Index\" (TCI), which measure how much heat nitric oxide (NO) molecules are dumping into space.\n\nThe results come from the SABER instrument onboard NASA\u2019s TIMED satellite, that monitor infrared emissions from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO).\n\nBy measuring the infrared glow of these molecules, SABER can assess the thermal state of gas at the very top of the atmosphere \u2013 a layer researchers call \u201cthe thermosphere.\u201d\n\nWhen the thermosphere cools, it shrinks, making the radius of the Earth's atmosphere smaller.\n\nThis means it can delay the natural decay of space junk, resulting in a more cluttered environment around Earth.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is very low indeed,\u201d Mlynczak told Space Weather.\n\n\u201cSABER is currently measuring 33 billion Watts of infrared power from NO. That\u2019s 10 times smaller than we see during more active phases of the solar cycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thermosphere always cools off during Solar Minimum. It\u2019s one of the most important ways the solar cycle affects our planet,\u201d explains Mlynczak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there quite yet,\u201d he said of the record cold, \u201cbut it could happen in a matter of months.\"\n\nThe most famous example of a prolonged sunspot minimum is the Maunder Minimum, referring to a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots become exceedingly rare.\n\nMaunder coincided with the middle part of the Little Ice Age, when Europe and North America experienced colder temperatures - fueling speculation that the two were connected.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMost regular folks know that local variations do not a global catastrophe make.

If a MAGA hat wearing Trump supporter staged a fake hate crime to smear the left, he'd rot in prison for the rest of his life. It seems Chitcago prosecutors are worthless and easily bought. The case fell apart because they took a sledgehammer to their own evidence. They've got video of these guys purchasing the rope and the hats for crying out loud!

Why not pay skilled trades folk the [hypothetical unnamed grumpy old guy] sometimes needs, under the table, so it is way cheaper for him and way more lucrative for them? \n\n.... maybe because [hypothetical unnamed grumpy old guy] was brought up old school, to be a law-abiding citizen.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It shows how wacko it can get ... and how fast it can get that way.\n\nFirst, a translation from Canadian english:\n\n... what is happening there, is that 5 Indian family heads (yes, 5 ) from a small group of families (and they are actually a small minority in the local Band - the overwhelming majority of elected Band leaders oppose them), at a bottleneck point in northern British Columbia, are claiming an area of land that will allow them to control half of Canada\u2019s Pacific exports.\n\nImagine if there were only TWO railroads that took all the goods, and the natural gas and the oil and wheat, and the soy and the coal exports, from ALL of America west of the Mississippi ... and like 5 guys somewhere in a pass in Idaho, decided to control the route where therefore half of central and western America\u2019s railroad and pipeline infrastructure transited through. And they attempted to shut it down, to extort billions of dollars, if not outright succession from the United States.\n\nThat is the real reason behind the Wet\u2019suwhet\u2019en claims to sovereignty over the Bulkley valley and Houston (BC) area.\n\n(The Mohawk game in Eastern Canada is connected, but another story.)\n\nAnd because of political correctness, the socialist governments of the area let them get away with it.\n\nBECAUSE the socialist Governors and a President Sanders actually WANTED the crisis to implement a \u2018Green New Deal\u2018 and use the blockade to thereby end ALL oil and gas and coal production in the country.\n\nSo, therefore imagine if the livelihood of ALL the energy workers, all the farmers, all the retail workers (because goods can\u2019t be shipped), and so on, in the ENTIRE Western United States ... was threatened and in fact damaged .. and nothing was done?\n\nYep.

In Dakota Oklahoma are man, mammal, and dinosaur prints in what was once soil, but now stone. They  were all on this earth until the flood. That much water, surrounding the earth for that amount of time, put tremendous atmospheric pressure on anything and everything. Hence;soil-stone. Iyob ( Job ) 41 \" Would you draw out Liwiathan with a hook, or snare his tongue with a line which you lower? \" Whales. Behemoth.  Iyob 40:15   \" See now, Behemoth, which I made along with you-he eats grass like an ox. See now, his strength is in his loins, and his power is in his stomach muscles. He bends his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. His bones are like tubes of bronze, his ribs like bars of iron. He is the beginning of the ways of EL. HIS MAKER brings near HIS sword. Dinosaurs. A warning. Their end. The flood. Whales swim. Dinosaurs? Not so much. In the middle of a desert in Chile, a school of whales were found pristine in skeletal remains. How did they get that far inland without water? Lawlessness world wide is what caused the flood. You better end their lawlessness quickly, or YAHUUAH will pick up HIS sword again.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nUh, forgive me for pointing it out, but natural immunity, in this case, is not the \u2018best\u2019 kind, it is the ONLY kind.

I am old, but physically fit and farmer active, and have never smoked (drink wine like a fish however.)\n\n- I know 3 doctors well enough that they will speak truthfully, instead of just recite the official mantra.  Two of them refuse the shots - AND will NOT let their families be inoculated.  Third doesn\u2019t buy all the propaganda, but thinks vaccines not particularly dangerous. \n\n-  wife and I both double-vaxed - so that we could get on an international flight to tend to an ill family member.  However, 3 days after vax, my stong as a horse wife developed a heart issue that cost her her drivers licence, which is devastating for our work and farm. \n\nApparatchiks where we live are now saying we have to have 3rd shot in January. \n\nAs I say,  this is just anecdotal - but combine it with the FACT that they have ZERO clinical data on long term effects of MRNA manipulation of immune response \u2026.

You keep one and give one to your neighbor\n\n<b>A SOCIALIST:</b> You have two cows. The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor.\n\n<b>A DEMOCRAT:</b> You have two cows. Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell one to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for then take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to your neighbor. You feel righteous.\n\n<b>A COMMUNIST:</b> You have two cows. The government seizes both and provides you with milk.\n\n<b>A FASCIST:</b> You have two cows. The government seizes both and sells you the milk. You join the underground and start a campaign of sabotage.\n\n<b>DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: </b>You have two cows. The government taxes you to the point you have to sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow, which was a gift from your government.\n\n<b>CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE:</b> You have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull and build a herd of cows.\n\n<b>BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE:</b> You have two cows. The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the drain.\n\n<b>A GREENPEACE ORGANIZATION:</b> You have two cows. Fake scientists claim that you are causing hurricanes in Singapore. Radical activists steal your cows, ship them to a guru in India, and tax you for the past 10 years of cow farts.\n\n<b>AN AMERICAN CORPORATION: </b>You have two cows. You sell one and force the other to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.\n\n<b>A FRENCH CORPORATION: </b>You have two cows. You go on strike because you want three cows.\n\n<b>A JAPANESE CORPORATION: </b>You have two cows. You redesign them so they are eleventh the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk\n\n<b>A GERMAN CORPORATION: </b>You have two cows. You reengineer them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month and milk themselves.\n\n<b>AN ITALIAN CORPORATION:</b> You have two cows, but you don't know where they are. You break for lunch.\n\n<b>A RUSSIAN CORPORATION:</b> You have two cows. You count them and learn you have five cows. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka.\n\n<b>A MEXICAN CORPORATION: </b>You think you have two cows, but you're not sure where they are. You'll look for them tomorrow.\n\n<b>A SWISS CORPORATION: </b>You have 5000 cows, none of which belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others.\n\n<b>A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION:</b> You have two cows. You enter into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares bankruptcy.\n\n<b>AN INDIAN CORPORATION:</b> You have two cows. You worship them.\n\n<b>A TALIBAN ORGANIZATION: </b>You have only two cows. You load them up with explosives and herd them onto your neighbor's property where you blow them up. Your neighbor dies. You starve to death.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAgree. However I suggest one fine point:  I think it is not \"The Democrats\" per se.  It is a comparatively small core of Democrats that by every historical and political definition are now a ruling 'Junta'.  Sure, the mobs of 'Democrats' that go along or turn a blind eye to the criminality, or simply take the money and influence and run, are complicit  ... but they are just opportunistic fellow travellers.  We are ruled by a Junta as surely as any banana republic that ever existed.  And they care not for Marxism or Socialism or Whadeverism - they exist for the  dictatorial pursuit of power in and of itself.  They will do anything ... to America ... to further that objective.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
