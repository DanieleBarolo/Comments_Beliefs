Why Catholics, Protestants, Sikhs, atheist, agnostics, Baptist, Episcopalians, LDS, Scientologist, People of the Jewish Faith, Lutherans, Muslims, Methodist and all others should worry about this decision....this is not about "YOU" personally having the freedom to practice your Faith, or not too practice a Faith....This decision is about "EVANGELICALS" using our legislative process to FORCE "YOU" to believe in and live in lock step with what they believe, their VERY SPECIFIC so-called "Christian Doctrine" from their Faith...make no mistake they are trying to "FORCE" an Evangelical Sharia on the rest of us...they want to take our RIGHTS AWAY!

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.
