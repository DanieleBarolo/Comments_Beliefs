"Odumbo" puts your credibility somewhere around zero, but why would you think that President Obama being nowhere close to being a Ronald Reagan is a bad thing?

One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .

PARENT COMMENT:
Keep reaching libertards.  O'Reilly is far from being a Brian Williams.  Just like Odumbo is nowhere close to being a Ronald Reagan.
