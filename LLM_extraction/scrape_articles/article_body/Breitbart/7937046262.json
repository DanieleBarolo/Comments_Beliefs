{"title": "They Love L.A. – Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Move to California", "body": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex — also known as Prince Harry and his Hollywood wife Meghan – have left Canada behind and moved permanently to California, UK media reports said Friday.The Royal couple flew by private jet from Canada to Los Angeles last week before the border between the two countries closed because of the deadly Chinese coronavirus outbreak, theSunnewspaperreportedfrom London.The transfer is part of the “transitioning” process from all Royal duties to a “progressive new role” in 2020 the twooutlinedin January.Living in Los Angeles also moves them closer they say to living a “modest life of seclusion and privacy away from the media spotlight” they have previouslyannouncedwas vital to their future.It is thought Prince Harry is now keen to pursue his environmental mentor role while wife Meghan has never concealed her desire to restart her acting career.“Harry and Meghan have left Canada now for good,” a “Royal insider” told the tabloid. “The borders were closing and flights were stopping. They had to get out.”The border between the U.S. and Canada — the longest in the world — closed last week in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, as both countries see the numbers of those infected rise.Harry and Meghan rocked the Royal family with their January announcement that they will no longer represent the monarchy as they pursue a new, financially independent life.TheSunsaid the move to California “had been planned for some time” and that the couple had “realised Canada would not work out for various reasons”.“They want to be based in the Los Angeles area,” the source told the tabloid.  “But this move was planned for some time. They realised Canada would not work out for various reasons and they want to be based in the Los Angeles area.“They have a big support network there. It’s where their new team of Hollywood agents and PRs and business managers are based.”Meghan grew up in the Californian city and her mother, Doria Ragland, still lives there as does her father.The one-time actress also has a network of friends and work contacts in Los Angeles, where she could now seek to restart her career.Disney announced on Thursday she will narrate a new film about a family of African elephants, set for release next Friday.Kensington Palace, the couple’s official residence, did not respond to a request for comment about the reported U.S. move.The new life in the U.S. comes in direct contradiction to what theDaily Mailreported in January. It said then the couple planned on living in Canada and would eventually seek a home and business in Los Angeles – but only after U.S. President Donald Trump left office.“It’s by no means an immediate thing but there is a long-term plan to end up back in the U.S. with a second home in Canada, where they will also spend a great deal of time,” a source told the newspaper.But Markle, 38, has said she won’t move back while Trump is president, according to theMail, citing her friends.AFP contributed to this storyFollow Simon Kent on Twitter:Follow @SunSimonKentor e-mail to: skent@breitbart.com", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/27/they-love-l-a-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-move-to-california/"}
