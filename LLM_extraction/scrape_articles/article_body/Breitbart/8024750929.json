{"title": "Police Sergeant Fired After Hiding During Parkland Shooting Gets Job Back", "body": "Broward Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Brian Miller was fired after hiding behind his car during the February 14, 2018, Parkland school shooting, but has now been rehired following union action on his behalf.TheMiami Heraldreportsthat Miller “was one of the four deputies who were terminated because of a ‘neglect of duty’ in the Feb. 14, 2018, Parkland shooting.” The other threeterminated deputieswere Edward Eason, Joshua Stambaugh, and Scot Peterson.On June 4, 2019, Breitbart Newsreportedthat Scot Peterson not only lost his job but was actually “arrested for inaction” during the Parkland attack.Peterson’s inaction centered on him standing outside the building in which the Parkland attack was occurring, instead of going inside to confront the shooter.Miller, on the other hand, “lost his job after it was found he hid behind his car as the first shots rang out,” according to theHerald. But he challenged his termination “with union backing” and secured an “arbitration ruling” that says, “BSO violated [his] constitutional due process rights and improperly terminated him.”Miller is being rehired and will receive back pay.Seventeen people were killed in the Parkland shooting by an attacker who acquired his gun via a background check.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
