Awww....that's right. The research had this terrible tendency to reveal what we already know - fewer guns, less violence.

If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

PARENT COMMENT:
The other option is that gun control research coming out of federal funding has historically been very skewed, and taxpayers shouldn't be compelled to support one side.

The US Public Health Service (parent agency of the CDC), back in 1979 had the stated goal of reducing handgun ownership by 25% by the year 2000.  Seems like their research had shown that guns really were the problem...right?

Except in 1979 they hadn't started to perform any research yet.

If the only options are keeping your guns or doing research on gun violence, then that implies that people with guns, and the people who make gun policy suspect that the research will show what most people who oppose guns already suspect: That the best way to reduce gun violence is to reduce the number of guns.
