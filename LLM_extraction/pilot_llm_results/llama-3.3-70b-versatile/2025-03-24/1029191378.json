  "parent_text": "I actually watched the 3 1/2 hour hearings (and I'm not even a Senator).  I suspect most of the people commenting didn't bother to watch.\n\n\nDuring the hearing, I got a beer and played some games on my phone.  I even checked out what other shows were on and saw a few minutes of Ellen and Dr Phil.\n\n\n\nBut I didn't miss much from the hearing.  The same 3 or 4 questions were being asked over and over and over.  And the same answer was given over and over and over.\n\n\nI'm not a big fan of McCain but I can TOTALLY understand what he did.\n\n\nBTW - Texting and driving is much more dangerous that playing computer poker in a Senate Committee hearing.",
