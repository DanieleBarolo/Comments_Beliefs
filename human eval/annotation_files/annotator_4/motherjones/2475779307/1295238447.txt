I didn't know that a) they were a protected class but if you have some source on that, I'd be interested or b) ditto.
I'm sure you have proof that they "steal" and not collect dues.  Let me know when you have that. K? thanks.  BTW, you're an idiot.

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

The real pity here is that we have allowed corporations "personhood" and therefore claims to individual liberties. Corporate entities are not people and the law should never have allowed it to be seen that way to start with. It's time to overturn Citizen's United and all of the stupidity following from it. Corporations don't attend church and don't worship God. A "religious" corporation should not get special rights under American law. That would discriminate against non-religious corporations.

  So you are saying that corporations are run by mechanical robots??? I hate to break your hate speech bubble of corporations, but they are run by PEOPLE that pay taxes, vote, eat, drive, etc. Just like the people behind the scenes of Unions!!!

    "Hate speech bubble"?  When did corporations become a protected class? Just because your overlords tell you not to say anything bad, doesn't mean those of us who think for ourselves won't.
Sorry you can't determine the difference between a corporation and the people that make it up.  Perhaps you need a coloring book, a juice box and some quiet time to figure it out.
