If I had no choice but an alarm that worked some of the time and nothing, I'd take the alarm.\n\nYes, the media reports mass shootings to garner ratings-- no one is arguing that.  But you can't honestly be saying they're not increasing, both in number and severity.\n\nHow do we do anything about mental illness without a comprehensive background check system, which the NRA also fights tooth and nail?\n\nAs far as mental health goes, sure, it needs a revamp as well.  However, I'll think you'll find that the VA was quite well liked by veterans until the Iraq War, when it was severely overtaxed and underfunded.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If we're such a crazy killing nation, perhaps we should have fewer guns to crazily kill each other with.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI doubt that the entirety (or even the majority) of illegal guns in this country are imported, simply because of Occam's Razor:  it's far easier to get the guns from the country their made in.  Is there anything to disprove that?  I'm totally willing to be proven wrong.\n\nIf I'm not wrong, then there have to be legal buyers turning the guns over to illegal hands.  Or is the pool of illegal arms so large that criminals can continue to draw from it with no need of replenishment?\n\nAgain, if I'm not wrong, how do we combat legal buying as a front for illegal activities?  Tag the guns to a purchase?  Install personal IDs on the guns (the NRA was vehemently against \"SmartGuns\", correct?  Granted, the sunset clause in the NJ law was idiotic and so obviously inciteful it seems designed to fail).\n\nI also agree that the penal system needs vast overhaul.  Drug enforcement in this country is absolutely insane, and does nothing to help its own cause-- and much to help private prison companies.  Prison should be a place for violent, socially maladjusted people that are a danger to others.  Reorienting the view on drugs so that drug offenses were no longer the majority of the prison population would go a long way to helping clean up gun violence in the cities.\n\nBut what do we do about mass shootings?  What is the gun-enthusiast answer to that?\n\nFinally, I will certainly grant you that the firearm owners in this country get a bad rap.  However, you'll have to grant me that the Revolutionary rhetoric and the extremism common to them does not help your cause much.  No one is being oppressed by a tyrant king (and, really, even the American Revolutionaries didn't have it that bad, comparatively speaking.  Their complaints mainly stemmed from taxes and representation, not being killed and oppressed), so trying to equate modern day to that is a bit counterproductive, and more than a little scary to non-gun owners.\n\nFull credit to the NRA for denouncing the idiots bringing long guns into Applebees and Chipotle.  I wish they played that message as loudly as they do to defend guns when a school gets shot up, but I'll take what I can get.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

To force them to be around them, to use them, is an abrogation of rights that is so hypocritical it boggles my mind.  How on earth can someone who is advocating so hard for personal rights be so comfortable mandating people do things they are so adverse to?\n\nPeople that want to own and use firearms are required to get education.  Those that don't shouldn't have to.\n\nAllowing or requiring guns in school, neither sits well with me.  It makes me deeply uneasy to think of intentionally bringing more guns into schools.  I've been around teachers my entire life, with a couple of them serving in some very high-crime areas.  Schools can be a dangerous enough environment without firearms.\n\nI don't care how much training a person has, people make mistakes.  A lock doesn't get locked, a purse lies open on the teacher's chair.  The wrong student notices.  That's a real, tangible risk, multiplied hundreds, thousands of times over.

If you don't know where it came from, maybe you shouldn't buy it.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYou're going to argue the vast moonshining network in this country as an example of an issue with marijuana legalization?  \n\nGood luck with that.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

But employees must realize that sometimes it is necessary to put in extra time to help the employer make his money.\n\nNothing is perfect unless you work (?) for the government, in which case you can not be fired unless you are a total nincompoop.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI used to work at a big box store in the 70's. I had to print my own signs, make sure I didn't go over budget on salaries and other expenses, and learn to run the front end of the store and do all of the things to learn to eventually be a store manager. I also had to figure out the work schedule for all of my employees in my dept. and then as I got more departments, do the same for them.\n\n\nFirst, I asked if any of them had any preferences. I had them pick a schedule that worked for them. At the end if there were any times when nobody wanted, we alternated to cover that, which still left them with a basically a fixed schedule. It took less time when I gave them a blank calendar and let them fill it in themselves. As long as my dept. was covered every hour the store was open and I didn't have to pay over time, I was fine. My dept. had the lowest turnover in employees, which cut down on training, and was always manned. If there was a reason that extra hours needed to be filled, I had plenty of volunteers. And I had almost nobody who called in sick.\n\n\nAll I needed was the dept. covered and to not go over budget. I never did.\n\n\nI had one woman who was married with young kids, she picked a schedule that helped her with child care, saving her money. One kid who was in college, and some who wanted to work all days or all evenings. So for the most part, I was lucky. I repeated the same schedule for months at a time. It was perfect for me, happy employees, less time working out schedules, less people calling in sick, and not over budget. The store was open 9 A M -10 P M. A store can't be open more than 24 hours. Really easy my way.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe headline deals with holidays, but the real crux is a lack of predictability of schedule. Not enough lead time to get child care in place, no routine to plan life around. \n\nAlso, voluntary sign up would probably require holiday premium pay, something few retailers do. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

In the health of the mother, its a decision made because the mother's life is more viable.  That's also why an abortion for all the other reasons you mention is logical.\n\n\nWhat bothers people like myself about this is the idea of using abortion as overdue birth control, as a way to negate responsibility for making irresponsible choices, and punishing someone with no say in the matter for actions they didn't take.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It seems like the idea is being considered, and given weight. Is there some large community which disputes the concept?\n\nAs I've seen you write yourself, a decrease in lead is surely not the ONLY reason crime has declined.  But it seems to be getting respect as a factor. \n\n So my point is, why not take \"yes\" for an answer, and move on to a new subject. You're a smart and capable writer, whose talents could be brought to bear on better, more disputed subjects. \n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nBatty Brain.  Kevin needs to keep hammering on the lead causes crime beat for 2 big reasons:\n1) It has a critical public policy implication - we should be spending billions on getting rid of the remaining lead, rather than billions on arming police to the teeth.\n2) The fact that Kevin has repeatedly nailed down these arguments on why it's the hypothesis is true - but it still get routinely ignored by outlets like the Economist or fivethirtyeight (today) speaks volumes about how blinkered and biased our national conversations have become. \nLastly the whole lead hypothesis really lets us see our recent history in a new light.  Re-read Pearlstein's books - how much of all that turmoil was just people lashing out at the tidal wave of crime that was caused by lead poisoning?\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYeah, that was a head scratcher of a straw man argument when I saw it. \n\nBut on that subject, I really think the reason that the police get more weapons is the manufacturers have made enough buddies (and bribes) that governments buy anything they sell.

I can only begin to imagine the horror that it must entail. \n\nBut I've also never met anyone who's seriously been impacted by our current war. No relatives in military, let alone injured or killed. Perhaps I'm one of a lucky few, but Americans in general have very little hesitation sending people into combat. And I think one of the main reasons is that, by and large, a very small percentage of the population has exposure to war and the costs it entails. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Fines for minor violations go into the hundreds of dollars, yet paying them is like descending into the bowels of hell with all the lost souls and losing so much time that the experience can be as bad as the poverty it causes. \n\n\nLet's say you make minimum wage and work part-time.  Your old car does not pass the $100 smog test required for yearly registration--that money alone was nearly a week's pay to afford.  Repairing it would cost $850--a small fortune.  So you drive until the registration lapses, and a month later a cop pulls you over.  The nightmare begins.  \n\n\nYour car is impounded, and the fees to get it out are more than the car is worth.  Now you have a car sitting in an impound lot that still needs $850 to fix but will require $400 just to get back.  And it still needs to be registered, which will cost $190.  But rather than help you find a way out, the court of law comes down on you with more punishment.  You have to get all of this done within 60 days or you face a fine that will equal to your entire monthly income, and if you miss this deadline, it will soon be as large as six months' pay.  \n\n\nYou go to the county court building to try to speak to someone and find hundreds of other poor people, most of them with brown or black skin, who are sick and disabled and treated worse than cattle, shuttled into lines that snake around the room and into a dark corridor.  When you finally wait in line for an hour only to be directed to another waiting area and finally are called up to talk to an employee, nothing can be done to change any of this. \n\n\nYour County has now taken your car and left you with a mountain of fines, fees and impossible hurdles to jump---and you have no way to drive anywhere now to do any of this.  Getting to work becomes a monumental problem.  There is NO WAY to speak to anyone about any of this--your county court does not answer its phone, not even if you remain on the line for half an hour.  You will finally hear the recording that says nobody will talk to you and realize that it's all hopeless.  \n\n\nThis is America, the land where the heavy hand of the law crushes citizens for minor infractions and takes everything they have, including their dignity.  It is criminal behavior that destroys people's lives.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHigher taxes.

As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.\n\n\nIf you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nWe can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n\n\nYet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nProving the article's point quite nicely.  You clearly believe in gun control.  (I support plenty of sane restrictions myself, btw).  But you spent exactly zero time considering the actual content of the OP's comment.\n\n\nEnding the war on drugs would end the incredibly profitable but illicit trade on drugs.  You want to ensure people are fighting and killing each other over something valuable?  Make sure they have no lawful recourse for their disputes.\n\n\nIf we legalized all drugs, the rate of drug related crime, especially murders, would plummet.  I'm not necessarily advocating that action, but it's undeniable that it's the case.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

There should be a minimum expectation for each job of a decent wage with appropriate benefits.\n\nIf an employer can't meet those minimums, then it is apparent that their business is not financially viable.  Expecting the employees to make up the difference for an employer's lack of business ability is typical of many business owners and managers who believe that they are doing the US a favor by hiring people at poverty wages and dumping the costs on everyone else's tax money.\n \nIt shouldn't make a difference whether they are teens or second jobs.  What our \"race to the bottom of the wage scale\"  employers want is a nation of low paying second jobs.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI'm failing to see how that's an improvement.  Issuing blanket rules that affect everyone equally when they are plainly not equal is not productive.\n\nYou seem to believe that applying the minimum wage with no restrictions (to the \"macro economy\") is worth any collateral damage in smaller markets (\"micro economies\").

I've mentioned this before, but one of the fundamental differences between liberals and conservatives is that conservatives have a narrower circle of empathy, much more limited to people they directly know and cherish (family, neighbors, business partners, maybe their local community or people they help through church) and much less likely to encompass any systemic understanding of a problem. It's why they can be generous and compassionate when someone they know is struggling with something while heartless and cruel when it's a member of a faceless mass of people (worse, a faceless mass of people who don't look like them). \n\nNow that Alzheimer's has crossed into Jeb Bush's circle of empathy by hitting someone he knows, he cares about it and is more sympathetic. But until then . . .\n\nThe key word here is narrower. All of us tend to be more sympathetic to people we know and cherish, and more sympathetic to people we consider to be part of our \"group\" versus outsiders (otherwise we'd be spending more on foreign aid). \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt's not so different from all the GOP politicians who decide that being gay is okay once they find out a family member is gay. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

All of the diplomatic relations that are currently handled by the federal government.\n\nRight now Texas is not responsible for any of those things, beyond their financial contribution.  As an independent nation, it would have to form government entities to handle all those things.  They're not free.  They have payrolls, buildings, fleets, material, and all the other costs associated with them.  \n\nThat money has to come from somewhere, and the only place a government gets its money is taxes.  So Texans would now pay every dollar they do to the federal government, plus more to cover all the overhead which is now necessary because its not being provided by the feds.\n\nImagine a homeowner who decides to secede from a town, and for sake of argument, that they let him.  He's making the same about of money, and no longer contributing to the city taxes.  \n\nOf course, he also has to set up his own fire prevention and response, his own protection from crime, his own water supply, negotiate his own deals with the power company, etc.  All without the collective bargaining power of a larger city, so you can bet that he won't get the same rate as that town he just left.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

My point is, nobody wants to lose a loved one to the massive tragedy of suicide, and I think the poll findings reflect this.

First, the numbers themselves:\n\nIf you have a house, valued at $1M, and it burns down, you will spend far more than $1M to replace it.  You have to start from scratch, and the total value of the materials and labor will exceed the estimated (and usually depreciated value) of the old house.  The cost is >$1M, not equivalent. \n\nSecondly, in Texas' case, we're not talking about one for one replacements. Texas secession is like moving from a rented house to a mortgaged one. In the first situation, costs are passed on with rent, and major building costs are shared amongst all tenants. \n\nWhen someone moves to a house, their costs go up. They're now solely responsible for all costs. Unless the house is significantly smaller than the old apartment, all costs will rise. \n\nTexas assuming responsibility for all the services a national government has to deliver, as opposed to a state, works the same way. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

However, in the aggregate, I think we should also think of all the negatives that could come from having armed people everywhere (not to mention the right of business owners to restrict guns on their property). People lose their temper all the time; just like having access to a gun greatly increases successful suicides, it could lead to more crimes-of-passion type shootings.

Once you've had that, the rest just tastes like, well, McDonald's.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nTwo additional points in refutation of Capper's claims. One is that Capper's research is funded by the Beef Councils of Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Washington. \n\n\nTwo is that Capper's claim that it would take an \"additional 135 million acres\" to support the growing of grass-fed meat is a slight of hand. Today there are 150 million acres devoted to growing corn and soy - the vast majority of which goes to animals raised in confined feedlot operations. Those 150 million acres of corn and soy were once grasslands, but are now corn and soy \"factories\" doused with fossil fuels, subsidized by tax-payers. We don't need a net new 135 million acres. We need only eliminate CAFOs, and at the same time, allow those 150 million acres of mono-cropped corn and soy fields to revert back to grasslands. Win - win. \n\n\nThe whole CAFO setup is a house of cards. Which Capper and his CAFO industry backers don't want us to question.

Is that the definition of \"really conservative\"??\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nChart does a poor job of measuring Christofascism. There are no 'conservatives'. The GOP is a mob of Christofascist peasants who vote against their own interests because a tiny number of absurdly rich guys tell them to. Of course the rubes think all those 'institutes' are genuine and they think that greedy billionaires don't collect GOP congress vermin like poker chips. Jumping to the non-fascist side, it's interesting that HRC is slightly right of MoJo and slightly left of the NYT and WP. I guess the WSJ is considered to be only slightly 'conservative' because it avoids reproductive health while bashing ACA and championing Welfare for the Wealthy. I question the implied magnitude of difference between a political party that cozies up to creationists, denies science and wages war on critical thinking vs. a political party that stands against racism and inequality.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe far tails do show more extreme Twitter users, but if you're looking at the Congresspeople, then again the right actually has a smaller breadth of viewpoint than the left.\n\nMy unsceintific analysis is that the right viewpoint itself is somewhat more extreme to begin with, and the there's just more people more or less in line with it.  There's a wider gulf of opinion in the liberal camp, and thus it makes more sense that even the \"mainstream\" liberals like Warren would be represented at the ends of the spectrum.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Hey if your black and you get a degree or two in fields that we are actively hiring for, we'll throw you a million dollar signing bonus that no one else gets? Hire Headstart life coaches to starting teaching the value of STEM and plot out career salary goals at an early age? Should we lower the requirements for black hires, white guys at Google need a PhD (or two) but because your black we'll accept a CompSci Bachelors? Maybe start a white guy hiring freeze for a couple years?\n\nAlso this article uses African American and black interchangeably, but I think if were talking about diversity in tech you really need to elaborate because I know a lot more African Africans working in Tech than African Americans.  There are some of course, but CompSci doesn't really seem to be a common course of study for most of the African Americans I know.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThere are two sides to this issue. I am black. I have worked in and with the tech sector recruting since the mid 90's. I  have also worked with Jessie Jackson on this issue. California has been experiencing a huge out-migration of black people for more than two decades now. Many blacks have moved to more affordable places in the south such as Atalanta, Houston, and Dallas. Also, Black students who have been accepted to Universities like U.C. Berkeley, have turned those offers down because of reports that the campus is inhospitable to blacks. The issue is so much larger than just the fact that blacks are underrepresented in these companies. Blacks are underrepresented in California, period, primarily because they fear the high cost of living and are moving to places where they feel that their is more cultural support and community.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat's a complete straw man-- no one is saying that black people aren't capable of learning these skills, only that they aren't doing so.\n\nMost of the people you listed started their companies (maybe all of them, I'm not familiar with all the names).

Yes, there's very few black people in these tech companies.   \n\nBut when you want to start accusing these companies of racism, direct or indirect, intentional or otherwise, you better come with a lot more proof than this.  The article is borderline slanderous, and comments like yours are past the line.  You have assumptions and preconceived notions, not data, and you're making the accusations.\n\nThese companies recruit everywhere, but recruiting is a far cry from mounting nationwide hunts to find people from a specific race for new positions (which, btw, is probably illegal).  Its also silly for them to do so when they have all manner of people trying to get the jobs without extra effort on their part.\n\nThere probably are many qualified black people throughout the nation for these jobs.  But \"qualified\" does not also mean \"available, interested, willing to relocate, and work for this company.\"\n\nIf nepotism is the issue, and it is a big \"frat boy party\"-- which is so reductive its informative of the substance of your argument-- then the problem REMAINS education.  Why aren't black people in the education system where those connections are made?\n\n\n\nBy the way, I'm also sick of this \"priviledge\" argument.  People like yourself wield it (tellingly, as the last line), like its some final word that will make everyone suddenly realize that all the uninformed, unsupported claims you're making are miraculously true, just because they haven't lived exactly the same life as someone else.  Its nonsense.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to be black to understand societal problems any more than you have to be a plumber to understand that the leak in your shower needs to be fixed.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Check out the incident in Potecello UT at a POW/MIA remembrance rally a few weeks ago, another veteran assembly.. Not all bikers are white nor are they male.. All Americans, black, white, red, yellow, brown yes All Americans are under attack.. The old white women standing on bridges don't amass in large numbers because it's not safe, not because the numbers are limited, they are targets of many including police.. The militarization and high rate of deaths at the hand of our local law enforcement is a serious problem for all of us.. Keep in mind with the high numbers of the current unidentified foreign populace a LEO has no idea what they are walking into when they approach you and every PD has at least one paranoid insecure officer on the job.. Most more than one.. When the fed provides military equipment to local PD's what line of verbal BS is provided with this equipment.?

Both wanted a computer in every home, but Gates thought the best way was to out it on their desks at work first, while Jobs went straight for the private consumer. The 90's proved Gates correct, but Apple strormed back with the I Pad and I Phone, but Gates always felt that eg personal use angle would have diminishing returns and that business would have ever expanding needs for new tech. Apple has seen stiff competition and diminishing returns on the gadgets.

OP said that liberals aren't one issue voters. \n\nI said that's self-serving, provided an example of an issue (abortion) that a lot of liberals won't budge on. Then provided a real-world candidate and referenced a recent article proving the point. \n\nI'm not claiming ALL liberals are one issue voters. I'm only saying that to claim the liberal side doesn't have one-issue voters is hogwash. \n\nOur electorate, liberal and conservative, is pretty badly informed. Few people take any time to examine both sides, and both sides will turn on candidates they liked on the basis of one indiscretion. How fast would Elizabeth Warren be marginalized, for example, if she was said gun control wouldn't be useful, for example?\n\nAnd, again, Joe Biden, individually, was not elected to anything nationally. \n\nThe only national election is for President. When votes are cast for President, the Vice President is chosen automatically.  While the Electoral college technically casts seperate votes for VP, as long as political parties are in effect, the possibility remains virtually nil. And as far as you and I, John Q Public are concerned, we vote for president and get a VP attached to our choice. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

We're talking about the American studio filmmaking business. \n\nForeign dramas do well in foreign countries. Never said they didn't. Know why?  There's no need to translate language, and the cultural setting needs no explanation.  Even so, they're not competing with the action films from a financial standpoint. \n\nAMERICAN dramas do not do well overseas, generally speaking.  American dramas don't even do that well in America, compared to what an Avengers or Fast and Furious movie pulls in. Studios have stopped making them, by and large, which is why you see the glorious state of good dramas on television right now.\n\nYou clearly don't like action films, and I have no problem with that.  But your personal taste in films is not shared by the public, for the most part, and even a cursory glance at the box office returns for the last decade will show that.  You have to go back to 2006 to even find an adult drama that cracked the top ten (The Pursuit of Happyness- boxofficemojo.com). \n\nAgain, if you want to claim there's no reason a woman can't make the same financially lucrative movies that men are making, I have no beef. But the original claim by Martha that the industry should just switch to making dramas instead fundamentally misunderstands how the business works, and continuing to defend it only makes you look more and more like you don't understand it either. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Fiorina's campaign itself did have a strong fundraising quarter, raising $6.7 million, a dramatic increase from the previous three months. But this hardly shows a clear picture of her team's financial strength. CARLY for America, the super-PAC backing Fiorina, won't report its fundraising totals again until January.\n\nRubio raised less money in the third quarter than in the second, but his campaign is also largely driven by outside groups. The New York Times reported recently that at least $5.5 million worth of pro-Rubio ads have been bankrolled by a dark money group backing his campaign.

It's the only way to make gargantuan tax cuts sustainable, and they know it. But if you're wondering if those two programs are dangerous to mess with, see Trump, Donald. Yeah, sure, you can hop on the tracks and touch that third rail. But you might regret it. I wonder if that lesson is sinking in yet.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nYour search for beloved programs that don't have those three characteristics is just a little too cute.\n\n\nThere is almost certainly a way to test a program that doesn't meet characteristic #2 right across the Atlantic: scores of European countries have universal health care; powerful unemployment coverage; public housing; childcare; and other similar programs. They exist at various levels of generosity and universality. The more universal (in use and in possibility of being used someday, rather than in a more Rawlsian sense), the more loved.\n\n\nAnd the reason there is no way to test a program that doesn't meet characteristic #3 is that it's circular with #1: all programs that are universal are seen as paid for. Universal benefits are part of the social contract. We assume that the taxes we're paying as part of that social contract are worthwhile because we're getting something back for them. When it comes time to look for something like that, my reaction is \"Lo! here stands this universal program I have access to at zero marginal cost! It appears it is paid for!\"\n\n\nTo take the most prominent European example, Britons hate the idea of the NHS being gutted in large part because they've paid for it; if I've paid for my health care already, why on earth would I want to put that care at risk? It's MINE! What's more, their payment for it goes from pragmatic to a point of national pride. The NHS is a triumph of British society, and to the extent any part of the UK is looking to leave, they promise an even more generous guarantee of health care at the very least.\n\n\nSo then you're left with #1: are non-universal programs in danger. And you \"would argue\" this is irrelevant, but you don't actually do so. These programs are <em>constantly</em> under real threat of being taken off the table. Welfare reform happened. Cuts to lunch programs happened. Cuts to public housing and food stamps happened. So our non-universal welfare state is growing, but it is doing so in an unreliable way.\n\n\nBeyond that, means tested programs are less economically efficient. The argument that universal programs are better isn't just about money going into them; it's about how efficiently and effectively that money is used and what its effect on the overall economy is. Peter Lindert's book <em>Growing Public</em> examines data since the 19th century to make exactly this point: the size of the welfare state has no relationship to economic growth, but the structure of it does. And universal programs paid with broad-based taxes lead to better outcomes for the poor while also creating less economic drag.\n\n\nAs to your point about the GOP attacking seemingly untouchable programs: that's true. And they get absolutely creamed for it every single time. And when they were trying to sink the Affordable Care Act, what was their biggest home run argument? That it was going to take money away from Medicare.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nFlagged. This person should be banned from site.

Apple doesn't actually develop encryption algorithms. They're made by computer scientists around the world collaborating on greater and greater entropy algorithms. If Apple simply takes the data that's in the phone and hands it go the FBI, all they're going to get is encrypted gibberish. It would take current supercomputers hundreds of years to decrypt it by brute force. For that reason, the FBI wants Apple to hack their own operating system to not use strong encryption. But the problem is that it goes for everyone. Computers are all clones of each other. They hack this one phone, they hack all existing phones. And I want you to note that only a few months ago, the director of the FBI's personal information was hacked by a bunch of middle school students just for fun. That's the guy you think is really going to keep this \"secret\" from getting out to hackers? Wouldn't Russian, Chinese and North Korean hackers just loooove to get their hands on this.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nPerhaps you should actually read a few sentences on topics before you spout your caps lock laden opinions.

They Should Still Be Labeled.\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nA tangential way to deal with the problem is to push for widespread adoption of one of the most common and difficult to control weeds as a cash crop.\n\nIt's common name is pigweed, and you see it all over the farm belt, not just in fields, but any empty lot it's growing wild.\n\nPig Weed is just a species of Amaranth, one of the popular, alternative seed foods, and is part of the same family in which you'll find Quinoa. It's scientific name reflects this fact Amaranthus palmeri\n\nIt's high oil content means it would make an ideal replacement for corn currently grown for bio fuel. Amaranth can even be popped like popcorn!\n\nAnd like all quinoa like crops, it's high in protein and very nutritious overall losing nothing to Soybean in total offerings. You can even make milk from it.\n\nIf Amaranth were adopted in the Soybean and Corn growing regions, there would NO LONGER be a need to make GMO modified crops, because pig weed IS THE #1 REASON why they are going to such efforts.\n\nPig Weed is impervious to glyphosate.\n\nPig Weed is also extremely drought tolerant and will thrive given just a fraction of the water corn and soybean need to grow. \n\nIt also needs NO extra fertilizer, at least not on the scale soybean and corn do, because it can absorb nitrogen from the soil directly. In fact it is so good at this, fertilizing it could easily result in a crop too loaded with nitrates for human consumption.\n\nSo on top of eliminating the need for GMO Corn and Soybean, it would also dramatically reduce the amount of polluting fertilizer run off that is a rapidly growing problem today. \n\nUnfortunately the loathing farmers hold it in has seeped into the public's consciousness causing many to reject the mere thought of using pig weed as a crop even while they eagerly accept using Quinoa and Amaranth.\n\nIt doesn't help that Pig weed is the ugly sibling in the amaranth family. \n\nEven a very healthy plant truly looks like a nasty weed. \n\nIt lacks the beautiful big leaves and bright red seed heads of the the very closely related Mexican species that was once the main food crop of the Aztecs.\n\nWithout that sort of panache, it has almost zero fad potential that could lead to widespread adoption among the first groups in society whose choices often are the entry point for new sources of food to a very tradition bound nation.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nSorry, this is the review that looked at 162 studies:\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640946\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYour issue then is with the pesticides, not the GE.

You think that becuase you support positions which are on the side of right (which I feel you often are), it gives you leave to ignore constructive discussion practices.\n\nThis being the Internet, there's nothing requiring you to conduct yourself otherwise, but if you think you're providing some valuable contribution, you're very much wrong. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Now, then, as I was saying, the threat of annihilation hung. . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you saying, worthy Phool!\u201d I cried. \u201cAll that had to be done was to make the factories common property, and the New Machines would have become a blessing to you!\u201d\n\nThe minute I said this the Phool trembled, blinked his ten eyes nervously, and cupped his ears to ascertain whether any of his companions milling about the stairs had overheard my remark.\n\n\u201cBy the Ten Noses of the Phoo, I implore you, O stranger, do not utter such vile heresy, which attacks the very foundation of our freedom! Our supreme law, the principle of Civic Initiative, states that no one can be compelled, constrained, or even coaxed to do what he does not wish. Who, then, would dare expropriate the Eminents\u2019 factories, it being their will to enjoy possession of same? That would be the most horrible violation of liberty imaginable. Now, then, to continue, the New Machines produced an abundance of extremely cheap goods and excellent food, but the Drudgelings bought nothing, for they had not the wherewithal. . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, my dear Phool!\u201d I cried. \u201cSurely you do not claim that the Drudgelings did this voluntarily? Where was your liberty, your civic freedom?!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, worthy stranger,\u201d sighed the Phool, \u201cthe laws were still observed, but they say only that the citizen is free to do whatever he wants with his property and money; they do not say where he is to obtain them. No one oppressed the Drudgelings, no one forced them to do anything; they were completely free and could do what they pleased, yet instead of rejoicing at such freedom they died off like flies.\u201d\n\n-- From <em>The 24th Voyage</em>\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n#1.  Costs are borne by budgets.  I don't know how you get to math where a new 3.2 trillion dollar expenditure doesn't mean the government wouldn't need to raise revenue.\n\nThe cash being transferred is not being done on a one to one ratio. If someone doesn't work, and receive the UBI, that money has to come from somewhere, and taxes are the only source of income the government has.   The middle and upper classes are, by necessity, going to have to \nprovide tax money from their additional income to finance the UBI for \neveryone else.  \n\n#3.  Again, you're ignoring human nature.  People don't tend to want to form bonds with a lot of people they're not related to.\n\nThere's a lot of things that are more sensible for people to do, but we don't do them.  Hell, capitalism itself isn't the most sensible way to work an economy.  That'd be communism, at least how its described in theory.

And that was the beginning of the catastrophe. When the New Machines appeared in the factories, hordes of Drudgelings lost their jobs; and, receiving no salary, they faced starvation. . .\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Phool,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut what became of the profits the factories made?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe profits,\u201d he replied, \u201cwent to the rightful owners, of course. Now, then, as I was saying, the threat of annihilation hung. . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you saying, worthy Phool!\u201d I cried. \u201cAll that had to be done was to make the factories common property, and the New Machines would have become a blessing to you!\u201d\n\nThe minute I said this the Phool trembled, blinked his ten eyes nervously, and cupped his ears to ascertain whether any of his companions milling about the stairs had overheard my remark.\n\n\u201cBy the Ten Noses of the Phoo, I implore you, O stranger, do not utter such vile heresy, which attacks the very foundation of our freedom! Our supreme law, the principle of Civic Initiative, states that no one can be compelled, constrained, or even coaxed to do what he does not wish. Who, then, would dare expropriate the Eminents\u2019 factories, it being their will to enjoy possession of same? That would be the most horrible violation of liberty imaginable. Now, then, to continue, the New Machines produced an abundance of extremely cheap goods and excellent food, but the Drudgelings bought nothing, for they had not the wherewithal. . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, my dear Phool!\u201d I cried. \u201cSurely you do not claim that the Drudgelings did this voluntarily? Where was your liberty, your civic freedom?!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, worthy stranger,\u201d sighed the Phool, \u201cthe laws were still observed, but they say only that the citizen is free to do whatever he wants with his property and money; they do not say where he is to obtain them. No one oppressed the Drudgelings, no one forced them to do anything; they were completely free and could do what they pleased, yet instead of rejoicing at such freedom they died off like flies.\u201d\n\n-- From <em>The 24th Voyage</em>\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI'm not suggesting it any more than Kevin was in the article above.\n\n\nIf, under a UBI, food stamps retain the same compensation, then maybe its not an incentive.

Aircraft carriers are parked in the aircraft carrier parking lots located in San Diego, Hawaii, and a few other places. When there is trouble in the world, the commander of the carrier calls his men and they come to the ship. The commander then takes out his special million dollar coin and puts it into the coin slot. Then he turns his ship starter key and turns on the ships engines. He then drives the ship to the trouble spot, adding coins as needed. Sometimes, when there is no trouble anywhere, the captain of the ship will use one of his coins to start it up to show everyone how well the engines work.  \nWell, anyway, that's how I think it works. Or perhaps I've had too much Trump whine. \n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnd again, there's legitimate reasons for us continuing to be the de facto military of many of our allies, but it's not unreasonable to question if we get enough return for that investment. \n\nTrump, in his own blithering idiot way, does occasionally stumble on worthwhile discussion topics. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Two GOP Senators are blocking a sitting President from performing his Constitutional <i>DUTY</i>, and leaving the Supreme Court understaffed.  Which also prevents it from solving that very crisis, of course!  If he is not stopped- if Obama is not able to appoint the next Justice- then you will see this blatantly obstructive and anti-Constitutional tactic used again.  And again.  And again.\n\nThis is not hyperbole.  The GOP, in its role as NRA lobbyists, prevented a Director of the ATF from being confirmed <i>for eight years</i>.\n\nMitch McConnell has done more damage to our government and the nation as a whole, than ISIS ever could.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe difference of opinion is a feature.

Why aren't monkeys still evolving into humans? ~ Christine O'Donnell, who also said \"American scientific companies are cross-breeding humans and animals and coming up with mice with fully functioning human brains\"\n\n(5) \u201cI would point out that if you\u2019re a believer in the Bible, one would have to say the Great Flood is an example of climate change and that certainly wasn\u2019t because mankind had overdeveloped hydrocarbon energy,\u201d ~ Rep. Joe Barton of Texas\n\n(6) \"The big thing we are working on now is the global warming hoax. It's all voodoo, nonsense, hokum, a hoax.\u201d ~ Michele Bachmann, Queen of the Tin Foil Hat People\n\n(7) \"Al Gore's not going to be rounding up Jews and exterminating them. It is the same tactic, however. The goal is different. The goal is globalization...And you must silence all dissenting voices. That's what Hitler did. That's what Al Gore, the U.N., and everybody on the global warming bandwagon [are doing].\" ~ Glenn Beck\n\n(8) But you know, there are always a few bright-eyed optimists among even the worst of the anti-science carnival barkers......\u201cI know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.\u201d ~ George Dubyuh Bush\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHe's on Twitter.

If Deadbeat donated at the same ratio as the Clintons relative to net worth he would have contributed $4.6 <I>billion</i>. Which hilarious, because he isn't worth anywhere near $4.6 billion.

Trump represents as the highest of high quality. He claims American workers are the highest quality. If he wanted to make his products here, he can, and should, by his own reasoning, be able to charge whatever that quality takes. \n\nAnd again, the difference is that he's running for president.  His statements and beliefs get held to a higher scrutiny accordingly. \n\nBtw, liberals DO advocate for higher taxes. They're more than willing to pay higher taxes. \n\nYour example is a complete straw man. Liberals don't like \"taxes\", they believe programs the government enacts can help improve society, and that requires taxes to pay for them. It's pointless to pay money for something that doesn't exist.\n\nWhich, to circle back around, is what makes your comparison to Trump's foreign-made products a false equivalency. \n\nSo that's two logical fallacies in one post.

Or at least not enough to move their vote across party lines.  This should not be surprising at all - \"Better an incompetent Republican than a competent Democrat\" is basically what every Republican who voted for W despite knowing that he was an incompetent boob in 2000 implicitly believed.  This is what every Republican who voted for McCain/Palin despite Palin's obvious incompetence and McCain's poor judgment in picking her implicitly believed.\n\nTrump is even less qualified to be president than Palin was - at least she'd held elected office before.

But I looked at the tasty charts.  I don't understand how you get \"Johnson is a juicier target than Stein\".   Johnson's supporters 16% favorable for Clinton vs 15% favorable for Trump.  By comparison, Stein's supporters 12% favorable for Clinton vs only 2% (!) favorable for Trump.  And they're >70% \"haven't heard enough yet\".  That looks to me like a larger pool of potential than Johnson's.  But then, I'm not a pro reader of polls, as anyone who knows me will tell you.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nWhen she makes a progressive case for herself, she's insincere. When she touts her record, she shows she's just an incrementalist, part of the Establishment. When she points out the failings of others, she's driving away support.\n\nClinton's just spoiled for choice, isn't she?\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n<blockquote>However [if] you're like me and live in a solid blue state then it's of little consequence if you cast your ballot for the protest candidate.</blockquote>\n\nThat, in context of the overall discussion makes the idea that you are voting for a protest candidate a reasonable assumption. And unless you define HRC as a \"protest\" against Trump, it's again reasonable to assume your vote is for Johnson or Stein. And even if you're not actually voting for a \"protest candidate, you're taking up the defense of those that would, which makes the difference in addressing the positions functionally zero. \n\nIt's only of \"little consequence\" as long as the number of people who think like you stays very small. But the more your position gets voiced and sways opinion, the less accurate it becomes, because each vote takes on more and more weight. \n\nThe EC is dependent on the popular vote, just at the state level, and that makes the individual voter's choice highly important.   I live in Illinois, about as blue a state as you can get. A vote in Illinois can't offset a vote in Ohio, but if enough Democrats decide they don't need to vote because \"it doesn't matter\" or they vote for a protest candidate, eventually they will dwindle as a voting bloc to the point that Republicans regain control. \n\nThat's why it matters. Not voting, or voting \"protest\", is abdicating the responsibility you have as a voter in the hope that the rest of the electorate is going to cover your selfish choices. \n\nNow, if you (again, whether you personally or the hypothetical voter who's side your taking) honestly feels Johnson or Stein is the best candidate, that's a different story. But that's a minority of people so small I've literally never seen or met anyone who puts that forward as the primary reason for their vote. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

There is no practical way that more bathrooms can be added to every municipal building in a cost effective manner, if indeed it's possible at all. \n\nIts also quite a stretch to lob an accusation of political correctness at an issue which has been drummed up by one side, invented basically out of whole cloth, in order to rally a base that leans toward fear and mistrust of anything not white, straight, cisgendered, and (arguably) male.  \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I thought he'd lose, and there'd still be a mob of his angry supporters roaming the countryside with lots of guns. Instead, the angry mob now rules the country, and woe be to any Republican who doesn't fulfil their every wish and to any Democrat who gets in their way.\n\nToday, in the seventh decade of my life, I know a sort of raw fear I've never really known before. And it's not only the fear of bad laws and disastrous policies and destructive SCOTUS opinions all to come in the next few years. What I fear is the mass of my fellow citizens who worked and voted for all this, and most of whom will rejoice at what happens in this country.\n\nWhen I was younger I thought I'd see a much better country by now.

Open, honest discussion is exactly what we need.\n\nHere's the rub: You, and others found his reply 'dismissive' while my understanding was that he was focusing on what we, as citizens regardless of background, should be focusing on.\n\nAs an 'old white guy' (and I certainly don't speak for that demographic), what happens when POC make it about race, the attention goes from children, climate change, women's rights, etc to race.\nI'm past that (sees skewers at the ready).\n\nIf we truly want a color blind country, with freedom for all then we must focus on issues that affect all of us.\n\nThat unified, issue-focused platform benefits us all, including POC.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not very good at explaining this...maybe someone else can. :)\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnd I say we tried \"calling a spade a spade\" and it failed. Spectacularly. \n\nThere's also very little difference between \"campaigning\" and internal debates now, when the Internet has totally leveled the field of conversation. The DNC's emails about preferring Clinton to Sanders could easily be called \"internal debate,\" but they certainly became part of the campaign. \n\nIt's fallacious thinking to assume the same tactics that work for Repiblicans will reflexively work for Democrats. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Are the Bernietwits who couldn't bring themselves to vote in November for Hillary proud of the havoc they have wrought?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nWhat the forced birthers don't want to talk about but should be forced to, especially the nitwit-in-chief who's probably never thought most of the following in depth:\n\n(1) They don't like contraception even though it reduces the number of abortions dramatically. \n(2) They don't like comprehensive sex ed. though it reduces the number of teen pregnancies and abortions.\n(3) They don't like using tax money to help low income women with children, and there's no reason to expect that it would change if abortion was illegal and millions more low income babies were in need. \n(4) They don't want to talk about the reproductive police state they want to create where every pregnancy would be monitored to insure that no abortions take place and that every miscarriage is in fact a miscarriage.\n\n(5) They don't want to talk about the massive costs of the nationwide monitoring program that would be necessary to accomplish (4).\n(6) They don't want to talk about how they'd protect medical privacy while monitoring all those pregnancies.\n(7) They don't want to talk about the psychological, emotional and physical trauma their forced birth prohibitions would inflict on a raped, pregnant woman/girl by making her carry her attacker's fetus to term. It would be like raping her again and again every day for 9 months.\n(8) They don't want to talk about the 20% of hard core, anti choice jihadists who don't want exceptions even to protect the life of a pregnant woman or girl.\n\n(9) They don't want to talk about the hypothetrical penalties that would be imposed on women and girls who have illegal abortions. They pretend there would be none and were very pissed off when Trump told the truth about it, but as even the least legally aware person understands, without penalties laws are meaningless. If terminating a pregnancy is \"killing a baby\", then any woman who'd seek out an illegal abortion provider to abort a fetus would be guilty of a premeditated conspiracy to commit murder. To think otherwise is absurd.\n\n(10) They don't want people to know that more than 90% of abortions take place in the first trimester and more than 98% are done before their unconstitutional 20-week bans would kick in. Further, most abortions that take place after 20 weeks are medically necessary and would be exempted from any ban at that point in the pregnancy. So the whole 20-week crusade is pure, hysterical propaganda that's based on a lie about fetal pain that's been soundly disproven.\n\n(11) They don't want people to know how safe abortions are.\n(12) They don't want people to know how safe abortion clinics are, (the ones they're closing down \"to protect women's health.\").\n(13) They want people to believe that waiting periods, medically unnecessary ultrasounds and \"consultations\" where a pregnant woman is forced to view images of the fetus or listen to descriptions of it are in her best interests and aren't about guilt-tripping, shaming and emotionally abusing her in the hope that she'll change their mind.\n\nThey don't want to tell the truth about any of the above. Their entire jihad to eradicate the freedom to choose, Planned Parenthood, affordable contraception, fetal tissue research and coprehensive sex ed. is based on lies, hysteria, religious extremism and a profound disrespect for the Constitution, Roe v Wade, the federal government and a woman's most basic human right, the right to control her own body. And the MSM has been letting them get away with it for decades. That's journalistic cowardice at its absolute worst.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI can very much imagine such a turn of events taking place, which is why the current time is very scary for me and a lot of other people.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean I'm ready to turn over questions best suited for federal jurisdiction back to the states.  One solution does not fit all issues.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Less than 25% of the GOP now supports the idea of the popular vote.  Democracy has a Democratic bias.  Putin is awesome.  People reporting on Trump's words are mean.  Deficits are OK if have a Republican in the White House.  \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI went to great pains to explain why and how my suggestion would attempt to avoid partisan influence.  \n\nIn the long run, nothing is ever going to prevent candidates from campaigning mostly in swing states/districts/areas.  Its a waste of time and money to spend the most time campaigning where the votes are already more or less assured for you, just as its an even bigger waste to spend a lot of time and money campaigning where the votes are more or less assured against you.  We can only do what we can to mitigate those problems.\n\nIf the campaigns were to concentrate on smaller districts, <i><b>independently, non-partisan drawn districts</i></b> (I can't emphasize that enough, apparently) would force them to concentrate on MORE areas.  Independent drawing of districts would yield more swing districts, which would mean more areas that had to be campaigned in.  That might be a big step in the right direction all on its own.  Moving away from winner-take-all would hopefully emphasize those gains.\n\nHighly complex problems, and this is one, rarely have simple answers.  You haven't offered anything to address the problems with pure popular vote.  I'm trying to suggest a way to doctor the existing system, which exists for a good reason, to work better.  You're suggesting throwing out the entire thing for a simplistic system with highly apparent flaws and your answer to those flaws seems to be \"[shrug], I don't like what we have now.\"\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They think they're going to heat up their hate base. They heated up those against them. Time will tell which group is larger. They've taken political gamesmanship over national security to a new low.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nRetread, but during our last election, a 3 year old Syrian boy's body washed up on a beach, and photos hit our front pages. His family had a valid refugee claim, but had been given the run around by the conservative minister. The poll support for Harper bumped up a few points that week. Up, not down. It turned out refugee claims were being vetted within the PM's office, by his staff. This episode and the comment threads in response actually managed to shift how I see my country.\n\nNow, Harper did eventually lose power, and that and pissing off scientists, attacking any part of government that generates facts (stats can, etc) had a lot to do with it. \n\nBut 35-40% of Canadians were gleeful at a 3 year old boys dead body, and came up with vicious conspiracy theories about his father to excuse it. Those people are still out there. Don't expect them to be decent human beings or even want the country to succeed. Other people suffering is the entire point for them. \n\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat was before over a decade of gerrymandering by Republican controlled legislatures. \n\nAgain, I apologize for the bleak mood. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Quote the questions and report on what he ISN'T answering. And maybe do some research into his history and offer explanations why. \n\nThis article remains clickbait bullshit Buzzfeed would be ashamed of, hiding under a respectable headline and MJ should be above it, especially during this administration. \n\n(And I don't know what \"trial\" he's supposed to be worried about, btw. If he was under some real threat of criminal or serious civil trial, it would be all the questioning would be about.

Feckless, incompetent and treasonous administation....\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI generally agree with your premise, ie that liberals are succumbing to an \"us vs them\" mentality.  I see it in arguments about free speech, in identity politics, and in the calls for blind obstruction of anything Trump attempts, sight unseen.  I'm against all of that.  I've frequently spoken out about the lack of compassion and attempts to understand the other side from a group that theoretically stems from empathy.\n\nThe fact that I'm engaging with you, and in a civil manner, is proof enough of that, I hope.\n\nHere's the problem:  \"How about this, construct a coherent, fact based argument for your side that might actually sway people.\"  We tried that.  We continue to try that.  \n\nFacts don't sway conservatives any more.  Climate change, the failure of trickle down economics, Dodd-Frank, environmental safety regulations and a host of others.  These are all based in science, observed experience, or both, but it doesn't matter.  Conservative politicians, and a wide swath of conservative voters, reject them because they're the liberal positions. \n\nIt would be one thing if we agreed on the problems and disagreed on the proper solutions.  That would make compromise at least possible.  But on a wide range of issues, one side (conservatives) refuse to even acknowledge there is a problem, for solely ideological reasons.\n\nThe problem is that liberals are now starting to act like conservatives have for the past two decades.  We're now getting two parties of lunatic fringe, instead of just one.  Until facts actually become useful in discussions again, there's little hope of anything getting better.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Pease read the disclaimer before your launching your salvos.  All responses that do not take it into account will be summarily ignored.\n\nThe claim that a fetus is not a human being has no basis in anything logical or scientific.  \"Viability\" is largely an arbitrary line, and its one that is getting moved back all the time.  It could be argued that science considers an embryo only <i>days</i> old viable, since there are very short windows on which you can experiment on them before they must be destroyed (14 days, IIRC).  So everyone going around saying that a fetus isn't a child is doing so for the self-serving purpose of extricating all morality from the decision to end a human life.  \n\nNow, all that said, the disclaimer:  the argument that carries the day is that you can't force one person to provide bodily support for another.  You can't compel someone to give you a kidney, and you can't force a woman to carry a baby she doesn't want to carry.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I said \"with no limit.\"  Obviously we have to vet precisely WHO comes in, but you also have to control for HOW MANY people come in.  Especially because few immigrants move to underpopulated areas-- they generally gravitate towards cities where it is easier to assimilate.  But cities are also where resources are already taxed more.  \n\nYes, immigration is an economic positive, right now.  But its a matter of balance.\n\n\"there are plenty of countries in the world that have very high standards of living with much denser populations than us.\"\n\n\nThey also have very different cultures than we do.  India, China, Japan all have much different ideas about personal freedom and independence than Americans do.  Some European countries are closer in philosophy to us, but they have also had centuries of people living in much closer quarters.

What I take issue is not how it actually turned out, but the rationality of the decision <i>when the action is taken.</i>\n\nWhat you're missing is this crucial element, which I keep explaining to you:  if enough people chose to vote third party, or chose not to vote, the outcome in a \"safe state\" would also change.  \n\nAll you're proving is that those states happened to not cross that threshold.  That's not in question-- as you say, its reality.  But that has no bearing on the logic of doing so <i>when the vote is being cast</i>. \n\nMy objection remains that people feeling empowered to vote in \"protest,\" or not vote at all, in order to avoid making a choice they don't like, are essentially gambling that enough of their fellow voters will not do the same thing.\n\nThat's why I don't have a problem with someone that really feels Stein or Johnson was a better choice (I mean, i disagree with them strongly, but I respect their choice if its really a deeply held belief), but I have a serious problem with anyone who doesn't vote at all or voted third party despite thinking Trump was the worst candidate running.\n\nJustifying a choice made in the present (a \"protest vote\") because \nyou're assuming the outcome (\"candidate X will win anyways\") is like \nsaying that jumping off a building was a good idea when you jumped \nbecause you were sure that a bunch of people you never met were going to start \ninflating airbags on the way down.   If you're right, great, you got away with it.  But that doesn't make it sound reasoning.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Shutting down engagements through threat of violence is just the most extreme example of the issue.\n\n\n\nThe specific instances may not be an institution-wide problem, but the mindset that leads to those actions is.  To use a completely unequal analogy (at least in terms of threat to life), its sort of like saying that police violence should be taken up with the few bad actors and there's no underlying problem with training.

And while a tenured professor can't be fired, people accusing them of racism or whatever is enough of a hassle that it can cause them to soften or conform in the way they teach a class, which is completely antithetical to the viewpoint you seem to espouse (ie, students having \"chances to see diverse and adversarial opinions\").\n\nI'd be fine if they did away with commencement guest speakers entirely.

Puerto Ricans</b> \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/www.theroot.com/disaster-relief-workers-in-puerto-rico-treat-themselves-1819438945/amp \n. \nAs far as rural voters' anger? Bronze Age fairy tales grip their lizard brains. It's amygdalae all the way down.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nYour point about the \"reich wing media\" is a very important addition to Kevin's post (adding: and to the French article, which somehow doesn't mention at all the role of the \"conservative\" media in fostering the very attitudes he decries -- very Brooksian).\n\nOne of the reasons rural (and exurban) white voters are so enraged is that they are <i>taught</i> to be enraged, and to consider themselves victims, for <i>hours a day</i> by talk radio, Fox talk-shows, etc.  They are goaded into a frenzy of anger by people who know exactly what they're doing.  They're like caged animals being poked by a stick.  (I can easily imagine Trump enjoying doing this.)  \n\nThere are other reasons for their attitudes.  My favorite (in addition to the obvious ones of economic stress and overt or latent racism) is an intellectual inability (or unwillingness) to deal with facts as they are presented and instead a tendency to interpret (or ignore) facts on the basis of fixed beliefs.  Some revival of empiricism might ameliorate at least some of the rage, although how that would be accomplished I have no idea.\n\nBut far more important is the propaganda machine.  They're doing as they're told.\n\nAs to widespread violence, I'm much more skeptical.  Many -- if not most -- of these angry people are old and/or quite comfortable.  They're like barstool generals, vowing war against the world and then going home to sleep it off.  For them actually to take action would require far more sustained initiative than I think they could muster, and likewise far more organization.  Remember what happened when the \"Tea Party\" tried to stage a convention after they had lost their usefulness to the Koch Brothers and the money spigot was turned off?  It was a pathetic and hilarious carnival of fail.\n \nAt most, I think we'll see sporadic and isolated violence, against nonwhites or non-Christians, by groups like the Klan or the Nazis.  But I expect the vast majority of the Angry Right will stay comfortably at home in their La-Z-Boys and rant at the TV.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnyone else noticed that Shooter's heart just doesn't really seem to be in it anymore?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Its irrelevant.  \n\n\n\nThe point I'm making is that were California to secede, its status as the \"fifth largest economy in the world\" would not neccesarily remain the case.  As a state and not a sovereign nation, even the concept of \"GDP\" itself gets kind of squishy.  It is not an apples to apples comparison, so every mention of \"5th largest economy\" gets a big asterisk.

Private schools should exist along side public schools as a separate option, not as a way to funnel money away from the schools that exist to serve everyone.  That's like expecting the government to give you a rebate for your own private security firm, who will also run their own courts and prisons.\n\n\nWhat I was taking issue with is the idea that government doesn't belong in education at all.  Everything you talk about schools doing can be handled fine by public schools (a safe place to learn, with counselors and helpers, and different tracks for different learning abilities).  The problem comes in when people like Betsy DeVos try to undercut them at every turn and divert funds away from fact-based education into their own pet styles.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
