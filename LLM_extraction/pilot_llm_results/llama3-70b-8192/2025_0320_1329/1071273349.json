  "article_body": "As the government shutdown moved through its first week, the late night talk shows returned the medium back to the traditional satire we once enjoyed before the Obama Administration caused political humor to shut down.David Letterman is proving why his average audience member isalmost 59 years oldby using the shutdown to make some jokes about PresidentsGerald Ford(2:44) and George Bush.Of course the Oldest Presidential Joke is probably from Craig Ferguson who is counting the days of the Shutdown with the Presidents, meaning the writers don\u2019t expect it to last more than 44 Days. Tonight should be Madison.Ferguson had probably the funniest metaphor thus far: \u201cShut down like a Blockbuster video.\u201d He also made a poignant observation that IRS Auditors are considered essential, but the attorneys who help taxpayers through audits have all been furloughed.Most of the late night jokes are being made at the expense of a nebulous non-partisan creature called Congress, but as expected a couple of Republicans are lining up as victims of the comic assaults.First up is Rep. John Boehner, whose leadership of the House has afforded Letterman, Jimmy Fallon and Ferguson to make more jokes about his tan and the fact that his last name looks like another word that cracks up middle school boys.If there is no such thing as bad publicity, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) should be happy to learn that his filibuster elevated his name up to the level of late night jokes. Conan O\u2019Brien: \u201cDuring the shutdown, Ted Cruz will be donating his salary to charity \u2026 well, the charity is called \u2018Ted Cruz for President.'\u201dConan also found The Panda-Cam shut down as a good excuse to bring back the ever-popular re-occurring bit: The Masturbating Bear.The good news is, President Obama is finally sneaking into the monologues of hosts who once avoided it, albeit without much snap. Letterman noted that the shutdown was so bad, the President had to furlough his Mother In Law, while Conan said that for the Obamas\u2019 anniversary, Michelle gave the President adifferentkind of shut down.Jimmy Kimmel is a disappointment. Last night, the host of ABC\u2019sJimmy Kimmel Liveintimated that the takeover of the WWII monument was silly and that it was being protested by the Tea Party\u2013the same people he blamed for closing it.Wednesday\u2019sJimmy Kimmel Livefound the host claiming Congress intends to keep the Government closed unless Obamacare is defunded, which shows that Kimmel\u2019s writers haven\u2019t really been keeping up with the news. (It would be fun to send one of his gotcha cameras into his own writers rooms, and see how many of them could answer basic questions about the shut down.)You can really tell that the writers are rusty when it comes to political jokes. Fallon, Kimmel, and Letterman all made jokes about being able to finally cut off mattress tags. Leno, the only host who hasn\u2019t been avoiding material aimed at the current president, fired off some zingers. His writers areclearly the most solid:\u201cObamacare does cover carpal tunnel syndrome \u2026 the result of trying to get through the stupid Obamacare [web site],\u201d he said.Later, Leno mentioned how President Obama tried to excuse away the early glitches in Obamacare by comparing it to problems faced by Apple with some of its product launches.\u201cYou gotta remember, Apple has geniuses working there \u2026\u201d Leno said to hearty laughs and applause. \u201cThis is Washington. They don\u2019t have any geniuses.\u201d",
