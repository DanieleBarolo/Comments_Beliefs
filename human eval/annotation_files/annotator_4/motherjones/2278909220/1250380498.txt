So why do Somalis in minnesota have much higher autism rates than minnesotans? Do they get treble the number of vaccines or something? 
And why don't Somalian communities in other States have high autism rates? Could selective genetics among small populations have something to do with it?

It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

  I could not agree more...IMO It is no different than child abuse.

    It's worse.

With child neglect or abuse, the individual is typically only harming his and her own child- or possibly a neighbors.

These deluded people are potentially harming, maiming and killing thousands.

      Nonsense. That sort of ridiculous claim is as bad as the paranoia spread about vaccines. 

Further, if there is enough of a body of individuals in a community, who have refused inoculation of themselves and their children...they're in agreement on the matter that they'd rather risk natural exposure than whatever threat they perceive exists in a vaccination. 

They've accepted it amongst themselves, that, should they encounter and incur contagion, the outcome is their responsibility. 

In other words...they're only harming themselves. If you and yours have been boosted against infection, good for you. But that moral argument, accusing them of endangering one another, why, you might as well come down on motorists for the shared risk of being on a highway with others.

        Case in point ^


Advocacy of willful child neglect via scientific illiteracy, self centered bluster and irony impaired analogy.

          Confidence in the immune system, in a natural physiological response...is not an act of scientific illiteracy. It is, weighing the risk of a perceived threat, whether it actually exists of not...and putting one's confidence in the body's ability to deal with infection. As I said...unless there is something immediately life threatening, the chance of infection is just, part of living. 

But lets cut through the moral argument of neglect and get to the heart of it...all children, the individual that they are, ultimately, are going to end. By your position, the very act of bringing a life into the world is neglect. At the end of the day, there is no way to extend their life to a point of being immortal. There is no way to prevent their end. Why would anyone bring in a life, that, has no choice but to one day...be no more?

Weighing that, against the every day possibility of infection...I'd say giving birth is the worst form of neglect possible.

            Let's set aside the "birth is the number one cause of death" reductio ad absurdum argument as a tidy smokescreen.


The larger issue is that your reliance on the immune system as a society's solution to any disease basically ignores thousands of years of medical advancement, not to mention the devastating effects of the various plagues, etc. that have ravaged humanity. Yes, the immune system will overcome many diseases. No, it doesn't always work. And, frankly, vaccinations help.


End of the day, "nature red in tooth and claw" is not a valid prescription for public health.

              What's inoculation doing? Right...it's giving the body a leg up on producing anti-gen. That's...a reliance on the immune system. 

And no, I'm not ignoring 200 hundred years of medical advancement, I just happen to put a healthy amount of stock in millions of years of evolution.

                Them you are truly a fool. Look at the death rates for easily treatable infections in places like Somalia or even India. Place where their immune system has worked non stop since they were born. 


We are lucky to live in first world nations where we can wash our hands whenever we want to and have access to clean drinking water and safe to eat meat. With all the tools our society has available to help us to avoid infections and reduce child mortality you wish to ignore the most useful and effective, never mind the cheapest?


 I've read this entire page and still haven't found a decent reason to avoid vaccinations.
