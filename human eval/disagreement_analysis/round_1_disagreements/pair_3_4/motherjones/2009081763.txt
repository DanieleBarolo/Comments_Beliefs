Are you saying that Americans are vastly more violent than Europeans and Canadians?  That may be the case, but if I were an American I'd be hoping it's the firearms that drove up the homicide rate.

If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

I have an enumerated right to keep and bare arms end of story. I will not stand idly by and allow people like you to regulate it into obscurity. The problem is violent people not guns deal with them.

  <i>...fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.</i>

But that's just it: approximately nobody is talking about "taking their toys away." I don't think there's a single prominent political figure in America today who advocates actually <b>banning</b> gun ownership. The most anybody is pushing for is reasonable firearms safety <b>regulations</b> (things like registration and licensing requirements, safety features, backgroud checks, more stringent retail regulations etc).

The NRA wants them to think America is full of "gun-grabbers" but this is flatly untrue. Heck, quite a number of rich countries enjoy relatively widespread firearms ownership situations. If places like Germany and Finland haven't banned firearms ownership, America certainy never will.

Tell us again that no one wants to ban guns.

      Your link demonstrates nothing. It suggests Hillary Clinton is a mainstream proponent of sensible gun regulations -- not an advocate for firearms prohibition.

          Huh? Rather obviously, "banning assault weapons" is not the same thing as "banning guns." If assault weapons were banned, guns would still be available. Right?

            No one is fooled by the lefts rhetoric about not wanting to take guns away from the citizens of this country. If they could do it they would.

Please. Many rich countries enjoy widespread rates of gun ownership. Switzerland is one of the right wing's favorite examples. But  what Switzerland has in addition to widespread firearms ownership freedoms is  <i>responsbility</i>. You people want the former but not the latter. The left (AKA the adults in the room) simply want to impose on you the latter. And eventually we will (I mean, slowly but surely we're winning the cultural wars; gun control for reasons of politcs and prioritization in on the backburner for now).

                Those that need to be legislated into responsibility won't and don't comply now. Leave me and the people like me alone regulate violent people.

                  <i>Those that need to be legislated into responsibility won't and don't comply now.</i>

Regulations have an effect on the availablility of guns to criminals. The black market in firearms is very much an economic issue.

<i>Leave me and the people like me alone regulate violent people.</i>



There's literally no way to enact regulations that protect society from "violent people" without causing the law-abiding a modicum of inconvenience. I mean, a law requiring annual car inspections is a pain in the neck to the responsible person wouldn't dream of getting behind the wheel in anything but a road-worthy vehicle, but it's a small price to pay for safer streets.

                    I'm already highly regulated in regards to the second amendment. I know, I know, just one more regulation will fix everything.

                      "I'm already highly regulated in regards to the second amendment."

No, you're not, and more to the point, nor are your weapons. We've never done an honest cost-benefit analysis of what classes of weapons should be available and what should be forbidden.

Sure, the easy stuff is easy: no nukes, mines, bombs, etc. Yes bolt-action rifles, shotguns. What about semi-automatic rifles or handguns? I don't know, maybe they should be legal, maybe they shouldn't, maybe they should be restricted to target ranges. But people like you aren't even allowing us to entertain the question because... well, I don't know you, and I can't ascertain your motives, but it seems to me to be quite a selfish position.
