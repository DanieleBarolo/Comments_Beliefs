Paul Ryan (R-WI)revealedthe House Republican Leadership plans to pass multiple immigration bills and then combine them with the Senate legislation in the conference process to create a comprehensive bill.Ryan said the goal is to make what he and the House GOP leadership considers improvements to the Senate bill.\u201cA lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,\u201d Ryan explained. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.\u201dAccording to theMilwaukee Journal-Sentinel, \u201cRyan said in the House, where the Republicans are in the majority, the intent \u2018is to bring five or six bills\u2026 to fix these problems one step at a time in a comprehensive way.'\u201dRyan said negotiations are ongoing in the House for when certain bills will get to the floor. \u201cTentatively, in October, we\u2019re going to vote on a border security bill, an interior enforcement bill, a bill for legal immigration,\u201d he said.TheJournal-Sentinelnoted that Ryan also said the House will vote on a bill that would grant illegal aliens amnesty. \u201cWe\u2019re going to vote on a bill for people who are undocumented,\u201d Ryan said.Conservatives fear astrategy like Ryan\u2019swill not end in any serious improvement of the Senate bill, a piece of legislation even most in House GOP leadership admit is fundamentally flawed. As Breitbart News has detailed, many conservatives believe such a plan is a backdoor to amnesty provisions similar to those found in the Gang of Eight bill.In response to Ryan\u2019s announcement this week, one congressional GOP aide said it is the wrong way to go forward because the resulting bill could end up even more convoluted and problematic than what was already passed by the Senate.\u201cThere is no doubt: the plan is to send bills to conference and use the senate bill to make a mega-comprehensive proposal,\u201d the source said in an email Friday afternoon. \u201cIt could end up even longer than 1200 pages and have even more big industry giveaways.\u201d\u201cAnd once that\u2019s done there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d the aide explained. \u201cIf the people don\u2019t speak up during August it may be too late.\u201dSenator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) also commented on the development, saying, \u201cInstead of trying to save the Schumer bill with a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 accord, Republicans need to focus on helping out-of-work Americans find good-paying jobs that can support a family.\u201d\u201cThe comprehensive effort underway in Congress not only provides amnesty before security measures are achieved but calls for an unprecedented increase in low-skill immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cOur immigration system is of course broken, but the efforts we are seeing now would make things much worse-particularly for struggling workers of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n978116809\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI say whoever can prove they have an employer willing to sponsor and have NEVER collected any type of welfare and NEVER committed a crime (except being an illegal, of course), give him/her a temporary and renewable work permit and charge a fee.

Both of these factors put us on the path of dependency on government which then becomes a generational acceptance of any way of life.It\u2019s also reflective of the failed economic policies of the Obama administration and the desire by the administration to make government an even more central participant in our daily lives.A very effective tool for the left is to lower the bar for means testing or participation in any or a multiple of programs such as removing the work requirement for welfare. This makes it easier for more people to get on the system and for many to game the system at taxpayer expense. Welfare then becomes a way of life rather than a bridge to help those in need.To be fair there have been failures on the right side of the aisle in reforming the systems and in removing duplicate programs which allow many to gain more than a living wage at taxpayer expense. Oversight at the federal and state level for any cooperation for programs becomes an almost impossible task.The CBO estimates well over $400 billion of duplicate of programs at the federal level.In the case of the SNAP program when responsible states have attempted to account as required under law for the products that are being purchased with those benefits the USDA has struck down those attempts.Corporatism plays into this and there are many who benefit at the bottom line whether it\u2019s EBT transaction fees and products suppliers within the welfare system.We should consider a version of the UK system of consolidation into single credit and get a hold of total benefit outlay. They did it after their system failed and we don\u2019t want to go that far.Federal welfare spending is expected to skyrocket some 80% in the next decade. This is unsustainable within our economy.Democrats are hinting at almost $1 trillion in new taxes in the next decade. With over 90 million adults out of the workforce who will pay for all of this when there aren\u2019t enough earnings as middle-class incomes drop and taxing every rich person 100% could not pay for this. We can\u2019t tax our way to prosperity.Solutions:Clean up waste and fraud, duplicative programs, raise the bar to participate, means test and allow the states to clean up individually and prosecute fraud expeditiously. This will make the programs more sustainable for those who truly need it.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n1096777469\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhat's your point????\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

Within moments, the official Twitter account of the San Diego CBP tweeted at this reporter insisting the report was \u201cerroneous\u201d and asking for it to be removed from the internet.Immediately, the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) and the group\u2019s vice president, Shawn Moran, came to this reporter\u2019s defense regarding the authenticity of the information.Days later, the San Diego CBP deleted the tweet from their official account with no mention. They then tweeted that they were not \u201ccurrently\u201d bringing illegal aliens to house and then release in the area.Reuters now reports that the U.S. is canceling the plans to fly illegal immigrants to southern California\u2013thus proving the plans existed.According toReuters:The U.S. government on Monday canceled plans to begin flying illegal immigrants to California from Texas, where processing centers have been overwhelmed by a surge of Central American arrivals including children traveling alone, officials said.The Customs and Border Protection agency on Monday gave no reason for the cancellation. An official with the agency\u2019s union said the move reflected public opposition.Border Patrol officials in Southern California had been expecting a flight carrying 140 immigrants picked up in Texas to arrive on Monday, and San Diego Sector Chief Paul Beeson said similar flights were then expected to land every three days.He said his officers were expecting to process the new arrivals and hold them in custody until immigration authorities determined what to do with them. But late on Sunday he told Reuters those plans had been canceled.The June 4th debacle with the CBP came one day prior toBreitbart Texas publishing more than 40 leaked internal CBP photographsdepicting the conditions of foreign minors being warehoused in and the sheer numbers of them who had illegally entered the U.S. due to the federal government\u2019s failure to enforce U.S. laws.Follow Brandon Darby on Twitter:@brandondarbyBrandon Darby is managing director of Breitbart Texas.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLet all the illegals and amnesty loving senators and congressmen, as well as business owners to get their share of their illegals: starting with Obama, Reid, Boehner, Pelosi\nMcCain, McConnell, Gutierrez, Maxine Waters, Cochran, Ryan, Jeb Bush, Rubio,\nChristie, Cummings, Rangel, Schummer, Zuckerberg, Bloomberg, Gates, Buffett,\nDurbin, etc. For fun, throw in Rupert Murdoch and Valerie Jarrett, Mahoney, Hollywood celebrities who are in love with Obama like George Clooney and Sean Penn.

And then I\u2019m going to go serve breakfast and lunch, and I\u2019m going to help unload these trucks, hot meals for 3,000. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201dSome illegal immigrants have been found to have contagious diseases and dangerous gang affiliations, but Beck also emphasized that the United States should be accessible to \u201call those fleeing poverty and violence.\u201d\u201cThrough no fault of their own, they are caught in political crossfire,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAnd while we continue to put pressure on Washington and change its course of lawlessness, we must also help. It is not either, or. It is both. We have to be active in the political game, and we must open our hearts.\u201dThe number of illegal immigrant children under 18 years of age who have unlawfully crossed the border has drastically increased since President Barack Obama unilaterally enacted his temporary amnesty program for certain DREAMers in 2012.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYeah!

Debate\n\n# News comment article:\nConservative journalist Michelle Malkin and co-author John Miano say that questions regarding the guest-worker programs and high-tech immigration that are devastating American workers should be a centerpiece of tonight\u2019s GOP presidential debate.Malkin and Miano have just published the timely and must-read book,Sold Out: How High-Tech Billionaires & Bipartisan Beltway Crapweasels Are Screwing America\u2019s Best & Brightest Workers.On Tuesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily (6AM-9AM ET on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125),\u00a0Malkin told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that the discussion about foreign guest-workers in the tech industry \u201cblew up a couple of years ago.\u201dThat\u2019s when Jennifer Weddel, the wife of a semiconductor engineer who could not find work, took advantage of a YouTube forum and asked President Barack Obama what exactly he was doing to stop the layoffs of American workers like her husband who are being replaced with \u201ccheap, foreign journeymen, mediocre workers\u2026 largely from India.\u201dMalkin, who was writing about all things immigration long before the mainstream media and even the conservative press started to cover the issues, mentioned that Obama stumbled when answering the question, \u201cdoing exactly what these Beltway crapweasels have done and deny the massive, glaring reality right in front of the their face and then lie\u201d about how America\u2019s guest-worker laws are betraying the best and the brightest in America.Malkin said she would ask the GOP candidates the same question Weddel asked Obama and would love to see the Fox Business Network\u2019s moderators and theWall Street Journal questioner (Malkin pointed out that theWall Street Journalis the \u201cnotorious home of the editorial page that declared that there shall be open borders\u201d) bring up the issue in tonight\u2019s debate.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to force this issue and help facilitate its rise at the forefront of all of these debates,\u201d Malkin said. \u201cI definitely hope it is not only going to come up in a cursory way, or a grudging, reluctant way. It ought to be a centerpiece.\u201dMalkin asked, \u201cHow can we have these debates about jobs, [the] economy without talking about the deleterious effect that these kinds of foreign guest-worker rackets have on the best and brightest of America?\u201dMiano asked if there really was a shortage of American workers, how come 250-300 American workers at Disney got replaced by foreign workers? Miano further added that the notion that there is such a shortage, which has beendebunkedby numerous nonpartisan studies and scholars, is \u201ccomplete baloney.\u201d Miano, a former computer programmer, said that \u201cI\u2019ve worked with these H-1B workers for many years, and the very best among them were average and most were completely incompetent. \u201c He said it is also ironic that \u201cthe companies don\u2019t end up saving money in the long term\u201d because American workers are more productive.\u201cThe problem is these decisions are made by accountants at the high level who just see American programmers are $10 more an hour more than foreign programmers,\u201d he said.Malkin added that in addition to the \u201canecdotal evidence flooding the headlines now and forcing their way into the mainstream media that has looked the other way for so long\u2026 you\u2019ve got theNew York Timesplaying Johnny-come-lately now\u2026 and following much of great work that has been done in the tech press\u201d on guest-workers. Malkin blasted mainstream media journalists, \u201cmany in the pockets of the donor class themselves,\u201d who are \u201cpretending that somehow that it is aberrant that you have Disney and Southern California Edison\u201d that have recently made national headlines by abusing the H-1B visa laws. Malkin emphasized that the wages in the tech sector\u2014the primary indicator of whether there is an employment shortage\u2014have been stagnant since the Clinton era, largely because major U.S. companies have used H-1B visa laws to import cheap foreign workers who are no better qualified than the Americans they are replacing.She praisedscholarsNorm Matloff, Ron Hira, and Hal Salzman for \u201cfor doing the yeoman\u2019s work [that] completely blows out of the water that there is a STEM worker shortage,\u201d and she mentioned that her book traces much of the propaganda regarding the so-called shortage of American workers to some of the government science foundations that had every incentive to create the myth in the first place during the 1990s.Malkin said that the \u201cplatitudes that so many of these establishment candidates just roll out of their tongues about supporting the American dream while it\u2019s being sabotaged by so many of their billionaire donors\u201d just \u201csickens\u201d her.She also said her book is not just about H-1B visas and emphasized that \u201cit\u2019s important to have a comprehensive understanding of all of the ways in which these Silicon Valley companies are circumventing the already flimsy protections that were supposed to be in H-1B law.\u201dTo that end, Malkin said the second question she would ask the GOP candidates is, \u201cDo you support a moratorium on the B-1 program, killing the EB-5 program, putting the freeze on the L-visa, the F-1 visa, and do you support the same kind of scrutiny and moratorium on OPT [Optional Practical Training] in the wake of this injunction by the 5th Circuit on Obama\u2019s executive amnesty?\u201dMalkin and Miano\u2019s book,Sold Out: How High-Tech Billionaires & Bipartisan Beltway Crapweasels Are Screwing America\u2019s Best & Brightest Workers, hits stores today.Listen to their fullBreitbart News Dailyinterview\u00a0below:\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2354532752\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nObviously, you can't fix stupid.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

However, Plaintiff has provided no evidence that Black Lives Matters is a legally cognizable entity capable of being sued as a party in litigation.The judge\u2019s ruling made it clear that, under Minnesota law and prior court decisions, protesters have no First Amendment right to protest on the Mall\u2019s private property, saying that \u201cestablished precedent is that owners of privately-held shopping malls, such as the MOA, may exercise their rights of possession and control over their private property to exclude from their\u00a0private property political demonstrators, like the individual defendants here, who wish to engage in speech and expressive conduct on private property.\u201dThe group\u2019s protests last year at the Mall of America drew nearly 3,000 people and forced over 80 stores at the mall to close temporarily on one of the busiest shopping days of the year.On the 18th of December, the Mall of America sent letters to Black Lives Matter Minnesota organizers requesting they cancel the protest, which is schedule to begin at 1PM.After being served legal papers earlier, Black Lives Matter leader Michael McDowell stated \u201cBlack Lives Matter is not known for backing down.\u201dDuring a press interview given at the court by an attorney for Mall of America, other Black Lives Matter protesters \u201ccrashed\u201d the interview with their own signs, some of which contained a hashtag the group started to mock the attempt by Mall of America to protect the rights of store owners and customers: #MOASueMeToo.On Twitter, others used the hashtag to chime in with their own opinions.The protests are connected to the police shooting of Jamar Clark on November 15th. Clark, 24, was shot after police responded to a domestic abuse call. When they arrived, Clark was also beating the paramedics who were trying to help his injured girlfriend. Police say he grabbed the gun of one of the arresting officers, but other witnesses claim he was handcuffed. The shooting is currently being investigated by state and federal authorities.Black Lives Matter Minneapolis had previously issued demandson their Facebook page:\u2022 Prosecution of the cops who murdered Jamar Clark\u2022 NO GRAND JURY\u2022 Immediate release of the (video) tapes\u2022 Federal domestic terrorism charges against criminals who shot 5 protesters\u2022 Community control and oversight of policeDefendant Noor had toldMinnesota Public Radio, \u201cUs not showing up and us not speaking would be the mall winning, yet again, as corporations and police departments and the institutions collude to silence us, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dNoor was also the spokesperson for Black Lives Matterswho describedthe four men who Black Lives Matter protesters said were punched and chased before shooting five protesters as being \u201cescorted\u201d away. That event happened just before Thanksgiving at a makeshift encampment the group had set up outside of a police station. Here are protesters explaining what Noor describes as being \u201cescorted\u201d:Mall of America had told the Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal reported,\u00a0\u201cWe are prepared to use all remedies available to us.\u201dOn this year\u2019s business shopping day of the year, Black Friday, protesters in Chicagoshut down Michigan Avenue.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2423510958\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSoon, there won't be a \"safe space\" for white Americans if the BLM and Socialist/ Communist Dems agenda prevails.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

The Trump campaign is a direct threat to Murdoch\u2019s efforts to open America\u2019s borders. Well-concealed from virtually all reporting on Fox\u2019s treatment of Trump is the fact that Murdoch is the co-chair of what is arguably one of the most powerful immigration lobbying firms\u00a0in country, the Partnership for a New American Economy (PNAE).In addition to blanketing the\u00a0country, media, and\u00a0politicians with literature, advertisements, and\u00a0a barrage of lobbyists\u00a0pushing for open border immigration policies, the Partnership for A New American Economy (PNAE)\u00a0was a prime lobbyist for\u00a0one of\u00a0the biggest open borders pushes in American history: Marco Rubio\u2019s 2013 Gang of Eight immigration bill.While Donald Trump has pledged to deport those\u00a0illegally residing in\u00a0the country and temporarily pause Muslim migration, Rubio\u2019s immigration bill would have granted immediate amnesty and eventual citizenship to millions of\u00a0illegal aliens, it would have doubled the annual\u00a0admission of foreign workers, and it would have dispensed 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in\u00a0the span of a single\u00a0decade despite current record\u00a0immigration\u00a0levels.While Megyn Kelly made\u00a0headlines with her heated questioning of Donald Trump,not one of the Fox News anchors asked Rubioin the first Fox News debate about his signature piece of legislation, which Murdoch\u2019s immigration lobbying firm had endorsed. Instead, they lobbed Rubio a series of softballs, such as asking Rubio if he could put God and veterans in the same sentence.Interestingly, Bill Sammon \u2014 FOX News\u2019s vice president of News and Washington managing editor \u2014 \u00a0is the father of Brooke Sammon, who is Rubio\u2019s press secretary.As John McCain and Lindsey Graham toldThe New Yorker\u2019sRyan Lizza back in 2013, Fox News was essential to the Rubio-Schumer effort to expand immigration levels beyond all known historical precedent. As Lizza wrote at the time:McCain told me, \u201cRupert Murdoch is a strong supporter of immigration reform, and Roger Ailes is, too.\u201d Murdoch is the chairman and C.E.O. of News Corp., which owns Fox, and Ailes is Fox News\u2019s president. McCain said that he, [Lindsey] Graham, [Marco] Rubio, and others also have talked privately to top hosts at Fox, including Bill O\u2019Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Neil Cavuto\u2026 \u201cGod bless Fox,\u201d Graham said. \u201cLast time [i.e. during the 2007 immigration push], it was \u2018amnesty\u2019 every fifteen seconds.\u201d He said that the change was important for his reelection, because \u201ceighty per cent of people in my primary get their news from Fox.\u201d He added that the network has \u201callowed critics to come forward, but it\u2019s been so much better.\u201dMurdoch\u2019s support of open borders immigration policies has been identified as a potential conflict of interest for years.\u00a0As\u00a0ABCreportedin 2013:Murdoch, Australian born and a naturalized U.S. citizen, has become an outspoken advocate for immigration reform and mass legalization of the country\u2019s undocumented immigrants, partnering with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in this cause. Whether\u00a0Murdoch\u2019s personal views will percolate through his network, or at least temper criticism on the airwaves of those who don\u2019t share it, remains to be seen.In 2013, during the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight push, Mickey Kaus similarlypointed out:In 2007, John McCain\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigrant-legalization bill failed after opponents flooded the Senate with calls, shutting down the switchboard\u2026 It won\u2019t be that easy this time\u2026 The GOP donor class is asserting itself\u2026 One of the more influential members of this \u201cdonorist\u201d class is Rupert\u00a0Murdoch, which means that FOX News has for all intents and purposes switched sides, giving immigration \u201ccomprehensivists\u201d a monopoly in the MSM\u2013five networks to none.Indeed, Murdoch has himself expressed his support for large-scale immigration. In a 2014 op-ed published in theWall Street Journal\u2019sopen borders opinion pages, titled, \u201cImmigration Reform Can\u2019t Wait,\u201d Murdoch wrote:When I learned that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had lost his Republican primary, my heart sank. Not simply because I think he is an intelligent and talented member of Congress, or because I worry about the future of the Republican Party. Like others who want comprehensive immigration reform, I worried that Mr. Cantor\u2019s loss would be misconstrued and make Congress reluctant to tackle this urgent need. That would be the wrong lesson and an undesirable national consequence of this single, local election result.In hisWall Street Journalop-ed, Murdoch echoed Rubio\u2019s position on granting citizenship to illegal immigrants. Murdoch wrote, \u201cWe need to give those individuals who are already here\u2026 a path to citizenship.\u201d Murdoch even\u00a0decried\u00a0Americans who opposed amnesty as, \u201cnativists who scream about amnesty\u201d \u2014 a statement which is perhaps even more significant given the fact that Murdoch is himself a beneficiary of\u00a0the nation\u2019s generous immigration policy.Murdoch\u00a0praised President Obama for showing \u201cwise restraint\u201d on immigration, even though, at the time of\u00a0Murdoch\u2019s writing, Obama had already implemented his first\u00a0unconstitutional executive amnesty, giving away American jobs to\u00a0illegal aliens \u2014\u00a0including the jobs of black Americans whose have suffered some of\u00a0the greatest harms from mass immigration.When asked about the president\u2019s unconstitutional 2012 executive amnesty, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA], Marco Rubio has said that, if he is elected president, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t undo it immediately.\u201d This was another statement of Rubio\u2019s which the Fox News anchors utterly failed to probe in their first debate to which\u00a0they came loaded with questions for Trump, who \u2014 unlike Rubio \u2014 had not pushed an immigration plan backed by the network\u2019s founder.Murdoch\u00a0also called for an unlimited number of foreign workers to fill coveted tech jobs through the H-1B visa program, which experts have described as an \u201cindentured servitude\u201d\u00a0program:We need to do away with the cap on H-1B visas, which is arbitrary and results in U.S. companies struggling to find the high-skill workers they need to continue growing. We already know that most of the applications for these visas are for computer programmers and engineers, where there is a shortage of qualified American candidates.Contrary to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s assertions,\u00a0there are\u00a0more than 11 million Americans with degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)\u00a0who lack employment in these fields, and U.S. schools are graduating two times more students with STEM degrees than are annually finding employment in these fields.Here again is another\u00a0undisclosed conflict of interest\u00a0from Fox News. Sen. Rubio introduced legislation last\u00a0year \u2014 the Immigration Innovation\u00a0Act \u2014 which would have tripled H-1B\u00a0visa issuances. This\u00a0legislation was endorsed\u00a0by Murdoch\u00a0via the Partnership for a New American Economy, on whose board also sits Disney CEO Bob Iger.Though, once again, Rubio\u00a0was not questioned about\u00a0the legislation by Megyn Kelly and her fellow Fox News hosts, scores of American workers in Florida Disney were\u00a0terminated and forced to undergo\u00a0the humiliation of training their lower-paid foreign\u00a0replacements, now the subject of a lawsuit against Disney.Mickey Kaus has long documented Fox News\u2019s coverage of the immigration issue. As Kaus explained last year,\u00a0Fox News\u2014perhaps\u00a0recognizing how at-odds its views of open borders are with its viewership (oneFox Newspoll reveals that Americans by a 2-to-1 margin want to see visa issuances reduced) \u2014 implemented an \u201cimmigration tamp-down,\u201d blocking out coverage of key immigration fights in Washington D.C.Kaus analyzed \u201ca list of the lead story each day on Megyn Kelly\u2019s \u2018Kelly File\u2019 show from January 14 (the day the House sent the Senate a DHS bill with a \u2018rider\u2019 blocking Obama\u2019s amnesty) until March 3, the day the House finally caved and passed a \u2018clean\u2019 DHS bill,\u201d and he ultimately found that immigration was not the lead story once. [See listhere].Instead, Kaus writes, \u201cimmigration was discussed as the underlying issue in the funding fight only 6 times over the whole 34 show period \u2014 and only 3 times in the crucial 20 show period that followed the Senate Dems\u2019 initial filibuster of the Republican DHS proposal.\u201dConservative columnist andbest-sellingauthor Ann Coulter has criticized the media\u2019s fixation on ISIS to the exclusion of immigration, considering\u00a0that the only way that ISIS terrorists will be able to personally carry out attacks against American citizens on American soil is if our immigration system allows them into the country.The way media bias on immigration often manifests itself is not simply in what media outlets and anchors\u00a0do cover\u00a0(i.e. focusing on the needs of illegal immigrants rather than Americans), but what the\u00a0don\u2019t cover.As\u00a0any casual viewer of Fox News would observe, one sees scant to any coverage at all on the record-setting, foreign-born population inside the United States; nor coverage of\u00a0census findings\u00a0that immigration is about to surpass all historical records; nor stories\u00a0on the total number of immigrants allowed into the country each year and the strain this number puts on education, the economy, the welfare states and the profound changes to U.S. culture. By\u00a0not\u00a0covering these issues in any real depth, it\u00a0helps clear the way for the enactment of\u00a0the Murdoch-backed immigration agenda \u2014 bringing in the New\u00a0American Century hoped for by Rupert Murdoch, Marco Rubio, and Barack Obama.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2480260945\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI figured out a long time ago that Sheppard is despicable and stopped watching him and all the others, except Hannity.

He said journalists received instructions to write news that would be \u201cto Ms. Merkel\u2019s liking\u201d.Former head of ZDF Bonn Dr. Wolfgang Herles\u00a0make the remarks during aradioevent (from minute 27) in Berlin where journalists discussed the media landscape. Moving on to the freedom of the press, the panel chair asked Dr. Herles whether things in Germany had got \u201cseriously out of whack\u201d. With an\u00a0honesty perhaps unusual in Germany, Dr. Herles replied that ordinary Germans were totally losing faith in the media, something he called a \u201cscandal\u201d. He said:\u201cWe have the problem that \u2013 now I\u2019m mainly talking about the public [state] media \u2013 we have a closeness to the government. Not only because commentary is mainly in line with the grand coalition (CSU, CDU, and SPD), with the spectrum of opinion, but also because we are completely taken in by the agenda laid down by the political class\u201d.Worse than the mainstream, government controlled and poll-tax funded media in Germany just agreeing with the ruling coalition, the stations actually took orders on what was and was not to be reported on. He said:\u201c\u2026the topics about which are reported are laid down by the government.\u201cThere are many topics that would be more important than what the government wants. But they, of course, want\u00a0to deflect attention away from what doesn\u2019t happen. Yet what doesn\u2019t happen is often more important than what does happen \u2013 more important than gesture\u00a0politics\u201d.While these orders are sent to media companies from unspecified places in the government, they are communicated to individual journalists by news executives using a new-speak jargon. Dr. Herles explains that while \u201cthere are, in fact, instructions from above\u201d, when the editor in chief of ZDF communicated these instructions to his juniors he would merely say reporting should be framed in a way that \u201cserves Europe and the public good\u201d.There would be no need to add in brackets that this actually means it should be reported \u201cto Ms. Merkel\u2019s liking\u201d, as they would be understood as the true meaning.\u201cToday, one is not allowed to say anything negative about the refugees\u201d said Dr. Herles, concluding: \u201cThis is government journalism and that leads to a situation in which people no longer trust us. This is a\u00a0scandal.\u201dThere has been very little reporting of the comments in the German media, and what there was has been critical of the remarks.Focusreportedthe comments of one centre-left media figure,Der Freitagnewspaper editor Jakob Augstein who when asked whether there had ever been such \u201cinstructions from above\u201d, said: \u201cNo, I deny vehemently there has ever been commands from the top\u201d.That the German mainstream media is not free and routinely obscures or bends the truth has been a key criticism by the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of Europe (PEGIDA) movement, which has coined phrases like\u00a0L\u00fcgenpresse \u2014 the liar press \u2014 to express their frustration.Follow Oliver Lane on Twitter:Follow @Oliver_Laneor e-mail to: olane@breitbart.com\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI thought Germany isn't under the Third Reich anymore, after 70 yrs!

The bill would have provided a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants along with measures to secure the borders and ensure that foreigners left the United States upon the expiration of their visas.It is a history that Mr. Rubio is not eager to highlight as he takes on Donald J. Trump, his rival for the Republican presidential nomination, who has made his vow to crack down on illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign.[\u2026]Mr. Rubio also reached out to other conservative power brokers, including the radio hosts Mark Levin and Laura Ingraham, telling them that the legislation did not amount to amnesty. The Fox anchors Sean Hannity and Bill O\u2019Reilly became more supportive.At the time,The Washington Post reportedthat Mr. Rubio\u2019s advisers were monitoring to the minute how much time the hosts devoted to immigration, and that \u201cthey are heartened that the volume is much diminished.\u201dYou can read the rest of the storyhere.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nTo the who self identify as conservatives and still watch Fox news, hopefully this article will convince you that Fox news is not fair and balanced (and Brett Baier is not \"Unafraid\").

The group\u2019s Facebook announcement says:Donald J. Trump has made headlines in recent months with his divisive rhetoric, hate speech, and extremist plans to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. We, in fact, believe this will do the opposite to this nation. Trump\u2019s policy threatens many of us in the Black, Latino, LGBT, Muslim, and other communities. These policies and this type of speech has no place in this country, and certainly does not have a place in the city that Trump grew his empire in, which is considered such a melting pot and home for many of the same people Trump continues to wage war on. Join us at Columbus Circle as we march to Trump Tower as we say no to hate, no to divisiveness, no to fascist policies, and most importantly, no to Donald J. Trump.The Cosmopolitan Antifascists are soccer fans, working in solidarity with English groups who combine pro-leftist sentiments with the sport. New York City has a professional soccer team called the New York Cosmos, although the group says it is not directly affiliated with the team.The invite for the event leads to theFacebook page of Nathen Taylor, a nose ring-wearing man who says he previously worked atSaatchi & Saatchi Londonand\u00a0who currently works as a digital designer atLeicester City Football Club.

John Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign, was trying to draft former President Gerald Ford to challenge Ronald Reagan for the GOP nomination for President.Breitbart News has obtained a photograph of an original document\u00a0from 1980 that has never been made public. It is a form issued by the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s office, and was apparently signed by former President Ford on March 13, 1980. The form was witnessed by former top aide Robert Barrett and future Reagan acting press secretary Larry Speakes, and it declares Ford\u2019s intention to run as a candidate for President in the 1980 Ohio GOP primary.A source says the document was one of two dozen copies of the same form he personally obtained from the offices of the Ohio Secretary of State in March 1980, transported to Washington, D.C. and gave, unsigned, to a Ford operative. He then received the form, apparently signed by Ford, half an hour later and has kept it unknown to the public for 36 years.Titled \u201cConsent for Use of Name as First Choice for the Presidency,\u201d it contains the following subtitle \u201c(Several Candidates) Revised Code Sec. 3513.12.\u201d At the very top left in small print it is labeled \u201cForm No. 2-M. Prescribed by the Secretary of State. (11-75).\u201dThe photograph of the original document, provided by our source, is included below.Though the document itself does not specify that it is for use in the state of Ohio, it is similar to thecurrent document in usein the state of Ohio, \u201cDeclaration of Candidacy, Party Primary Election For President.\u201dOur source has also provided a photograph of another document, dated March 10, 1980, which shows the first page of the state-by-state delegate calculus he put together during his brief employment by the \u201cDraft Ford\u201d effort he says was led by Spencer.That photograph of the document, which references the delegate status of 10 states, is included below:\u201cWe had placed him [former President Ford] on the ballot with his knowledge in every state we could without his signature. He actually got in before he got out,\u201d our source says of Ford\u2019s potential 1980 candidacy.Note that the document would support this statement, as it shows the \u201cDraft Ford\u201d effort had placed Ford\u2019s name on the ballot in Tennessee, Maryland, Michigan, Rhode Island, and South Dakota, or six out of the ten states on the page.In Ohio, the ballot status listed on the spreadsheet says \u201cPetitions-sign by 3-13\u201d under \u201cActions Needed for Ballot.\u201d The date of the primary is listed as 6/3.\u201cMy role was to find out about the deadlines [for filing to run by state], and report back,\u201d our source says.Reagan biographer Craig Shirley extensively documented the \u201cDraft Ford\u201d movement organized by Spencer in his 2009 account of Reagan\u2019s 1980 campaign,Rendezvous With Destiny.The new documents would indicate that Ford, encouraged by current Kasich operative Spencer, may have been closer to announcing his candidacy than was previously known.The man working to stop Reagan in 1980 is now using his behind-the-scenes political skills to \u201cStop Trump\u201d through the Kasich campaign.\u201cThis is not the first time the Empire has tried to strike back,\u201d our source says of the current efforts to \u201cStop Trump.\u201dFor his part, former President Ford wanted no evidence of his plan to challenge Reagan in 1980 to survive.\u201cYou have to make sure if we don\u2019t do this, these documents don\u2019t ever see the light of day,\u201d Ford said to another person at the time, according to our source.The race for the GOP nomination in March 1980 was still undecided. Reagan and George H.W. Bush were competing vigorously, and Sen. Howard Baker had just dropped out.The establishment was concerned that Reagan would win the nomination, but lose the general election, as polls at the time showed Jimmy Carter with a 15-point lead.As Shirley wrote inRendezvous With Destiny:Although Bush was drawing big crowds in Florida, the volatility of the GOP contest fueled speculation that former President Ford might\u2013or should\u2013get in the race. Campaign Maestro Stu Spencer made several probing calls around the country to Republicans, taking soundings as to how they felt about Ford jumping in\u2026 He complained privately that Reagan was too conservative to be president\u2026[On March 7, 1980] Ford went down to Eckerd College in Florida to give a speech\u2026Spencer coyly told reporters \u201cI think you can look for a news story next week.\u201d \u2026If Ford was going to take the plunge, he would have to do so quickly. Filing deadlines were looming in many states\u2026Ford aides began drawing up a campaign plan. In early March, a group led by Thomas Reed, Ford\u2019s former secretary of the air force, and Leonard Firestone, Ford\u2019s wealthy next door neighbor in California, formally created the Draft Ford Committee. Reed, like Spencer, had once worked for Reagan. A young former White House aide, Larry Speakes, was recruited as the committee\u2019s spokesman.\u201cAlso, Bob Teeter was meeting with Ford and the Draft Ford committee even though he was already working for Bush for President!\u201d author Shirley tells Breitbart News.Shirley\u2019s account corroborates our source\u2019s story, who says he waited in the lobby of a Washington, D.C. hotel on March 13 where Ford later that nightdelivered a speech to a fundraiserfor GOP House members and senators.\u201cThe guy I reported to reported directly to Thomas Reed,\u201d our source says.\u201cYou knew that Spencer was involved. I just personally did not have direct contact with him,\u201d our source adds.\u201cIt was very compartmentalized,\u201d our source notes.The spreadsheet confirms the importance of March 13. \u201cLast date intent of candidacy must be signed\u201d it read. The forms did not have to be filed with the Secretary of State in Ohio until March 20.Spencer\u2019s active leadership in the \u201cDraft Ford\u201d efforts is documented by numerous contemporaneous press reports, cited in Shirley\u2019s thoroughly researched and factually impeccable bookRendezvous With Destiny:Miami Herald, March 7, 1980, 17A, \u201cFord Plays Cool at College: No, Not Yet-but Maybe,\u201d by Sara RimerNew York Times, March 7, 1980, A1, \u201cFord Supporters Organize Group to Spur a Draft,\u201d by Adam ClymerNewsweek, March 10, 1980, 28, \u201cThe GOP\u2019s Hamlet,\u201d by Dennis A.

Broder, Bill Peterson, Lou Cannon, Dan Balz, and Maralee SchwartzSpencer had worked for Reagan from the beginning, starting in the 1966 California Governor\u2019s race. He had been on the outs with Reagan for several years at the time of the \u201cDraft Ford\u201d effort, but would, later in 1980,go back to work for him, and would be on Reagan\u2019s team through much of his administration.Twenty eight years later, when he \u201cwas interviewed for the Gerald R. Ford Oral History Project on December 2 and 3, 2008 by Richard Norton Smith,\u201d Spencertellsa somewhat revisionist story of the degree to which he was involved in the \u201cDraft Ford\u201d effort:Spencer: There was always, by people you might call Ford people, whether he ran or not in 1980 \u2013 there was always talk and speculation that he might go seek it. He never really tipped his hand during all these things. Then you get down to, it\u2019s the fall of 1979, I think it\u2019s the early fall, and a lot of his friends in the east are calling him and encouraging him, some asking him, but a lot encouraging him. There was still this animosity toward Reagan, this belief that Reagan wasn\u2019t a heavyweight \u2013 that Reagan couldn\u2019t do it. This still persisted in the eastern establishment types. So he was getting those phone calls, people coming out and sitting here and talking to him and telling him, and I had a conversation with him early in that period. What I basically said, there are periods of opportunity, you\u2019ve passed two of them \u2013 to get him prepared to do this. So you\u2019ve got to make a decision. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d made a decision yet, otherwise our openings \u2013 things that have to get accomplished at this point in time, at this point in time and this point in time.Smith: In organizational terms.Spencer: Organizationally, although the whole thing. And Reagan was doing them all. I told him the window of opportunity was going to close, without saying do it or don\u2019t do it. It was, \u201cHey, these are the facts, Mister.\u201d He listened as I went through all this. So he called a meeting. Held it in his conference room over here, of which, you\u2019ve probably got the list somewhere, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got it.The eastern crowd was here, Bailey was here, Deardourff was here, I think Jack was here, Marsh and Teeter and Cheney was here, I was here, I think Phil Buchen might have been here. People like that. These in the group really wanted him to run. I mean, they have him a pitch to run. Cheney shared my thoughts at the time. I put a damper in the meeting, I\u2019m sure. I just said, \u201cHey, we missed too many opportunities to do it.\u201d I was still the only one who said, \u201cHey, Ronald Reagan\u2019s one tough candidate. He\u2019s one of the best, you\u2019re not running against a patsy. He basically today owns the party. To me, guys, this is not a realistic decision. It could be a suicide mission.\u201d But I said, \u201cIt\u2019s his decision to make.\u201d He listens, he always listened and listened and listened and kept his own counsel, but I definitely left the meeting and Cheney and I had stayed overnight at the Racquet Club and then came over here and then he was flying out, I was driving back to Newport.We left the meeting, we were convinced he wasn\u2019t going to do it. I think it was two days later, 48 hours later, I get a phone call. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have another meeting to talk about the presidency.\u201d Barrett calls me. I said, \u201cYou\u2019re nuts.\u201d He says, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s got another meeting. We can\u2019t find Dick. Can you get him?\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019ll get him.\u201d So I called Dick and he said, \u201cI ain\u2019t coming to another meeting. They know my position.\u201d He was right. \u201cI\u2019m not flying back out there for another meeting.\u201d He was not a Reagan guy at all, he never thought very highly of Reagan, Mr. Cheney didn\u2019t. The second meeting was held. I don\u2019t know what transpired, but I think Betty got in the act. I could smell it. By the time he went home and Betty said, \u201cI ain\u2019t going to do it.\u201d It was pretty much pronouncement at that second meeting that, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it.\u201dSmith: She had just come off the intervention, and had a whole new life out here.Spencer: Oh, yeah. Whole new world. I don\u2019t know what she said to him \u2013 she said something and that was the end of that game.Smith: Did the meeting take place? The second meeting? You attended a second meeting, but the tone was different?Spencer: Yeah, the tone was different, the crowd was different. That\u2019s when I said Betty got in the act.Smith: It would have made no sense, would it \u2013 for him to run in \u201980?Spencer: No. It only would have made sense if on January 1, \u201977, he would have said, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do it,\u201d and gone out there and started working his butt off. Then it might have worked. But no, he wanted to make the money \u2013 you couldn\u2019t have them both.On March 16, 1980, Ford publicly announced he would not be running for the 1980 GOP nomination,saying\u201cAmerica needs a new President. I have determined that I can best help that cause by not being a candidate for President, which might further divide my party.\u201dShortly after that announcement, our source was summoned to the office of his superior to witness the destruction of all two dozen copies of the Ohio Secretary of State form, all signed by Ford.All but two of the identical documents were shredded.With a grin and a wink, our source\u2019s superior handed one of the two documents to our source, keeping the other.\u201cHold on to that,\u201d he told our source. \u201cSomeday that may pay for your kid\u2019s college.\u201dOur source provided a copy of the document to Breitbart News free of charge.The Kasich campaign \u201cis a client of Shirley & Banister though I am not personally involved,\u201d author Shirley tells Breitbart News.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2602517028\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThere are many GOPe politicians who were anti-Reagan in the '80s.

Ted Cruz.Ohio Governor John Kasich is a distant third. The Hoosier State\u2019s primary on May 3 may well determine the outcome of the Republican nomination.Trump holds an 8 point lead over Cruz, according to apoll from Fox News. He\u00a0has 41 percent support against 33 percent for Cruz. Kasich is a distant third with 16 percent support.A poll from Indianapolis TV station WTHRshows a tighter race, with Trump leading Cruz by 6 points, 37 percent to 31 percent. Kasich is again third, with 22 percent support. Among core Republican voters, though, the race between Trump and Cruz is a virtual tie.Both polls were conducted April 18-21 and have margins of error of 4 percent. The poll interviews were conducted immediately before and after Trump\u2019s landslide win in New York State.There are 57 delegates at stake in Indiana\u2019s winner-take-most open primary. The winner of the statewide vote receives 30 delegates. Another 27 delegates are awarded to the winners in the state\u2019s 9 congressional districts. The winning candidate in each district receives 3 delegates.Indiana is the next potentially competitive state on the primary calendar. Next week, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island hold their primaries. Donald Trump is expected to win all five states and collect most of the delegates from these contests. The only exception is Pennsylvania, which elects 54 unbound delegates to the RNC convention through the state\u2019s congressional districts.If Trump captures Indiana and wins most of its delegates, he will be well positioned to secure, or get very close to, the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination on the first ballot at the RNC convention. If Cruz captures Indiana, however, Trump will face a steep challenge in winning a majority of delegates before the convention.The conservative Club for Growth recently announced a $1.5 million ad buy in Indiana to oppose Trump\u2019s candidacy. It is likely that other organizations that oppose Trump will also flood the Indiana airwaves in an attempt to block Trump. Most of these organizations largely are ignoring next week\u2019s primaries, since they are being held in a region where Trump has run very strong.John Kasich has the highest net-favorable rating at +25. The net-favorable ratings for Trump and Cruz are both +16. Cruz, however, has the highest net-favorable rating in Marion County, which includes the state\u2019s biggest city Indianapolis.Cruz also has the highest net-favorable rating, +33, among women under 55. Kasich\u2019s net-favorable rating with this group is +30, while Trump\u2019s is just +1. Kasich, however, has the highest rating among women older than 55.Trump\u2019s lead in the state is built on his large margin with male voters, where he leads Cruz by 11 points. Trump\u2019s lead among women is just 3 points. Trump has a 16-point lead among voters without a college degree, while Cruz edges Trump among college graduates by just 1 point.Trump leads among voters older than 45 and those who identify as \u201cRepublicans.\u201d Cruz leads among voters younger than 45, evangelicals and voters who identify as \u201cvery conservative.\u201dOne-in-four potential Republican primary voters say they may still change their mind as to which candidate to support.The Cruz campaign, and groups opposing Trump, hope Indiana can be a replay of the primary race in Wisconsin, a midwestern state with a lot of similarities to Indiana. There are particular characteristics in Indiana that are fertile territory for all three Republican candidates.Pollsat a similar pointbefore the Wisconsin primary also showed a close contest between Trump and Cruz. In those polls, Kasich was also polling at around 20 percent. Cruz\u2019s victory in Wisconsin was largely fueled by an exodus of Kasich supporters to the Texan\u2019s campaign. On election day, Kasich only received 14 percent support in the Badger State, with Cruz gaining from the defections.Trump\u2019s final vote in Wisconsin, in fact, was about where he was polling just over a week before the contest. The difference in the outcome was a collapse in support for Kasich and a surge in support for Cruz.If Cruz stops Trump in Indiana, the primary contest will stay heated until the final votes on June 7th. If Trump can win the Hoosier State, however, the momentum he gained after New York may evolve into inevitability.With a loss in Indiana, Cruz would have to win the California primary to have any hope of blocking Trump from winning the nomination on the first ballot. That would likely prove a state too far for Cruz.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnother Flynn cheer leading for Cruz!!

But he doesn\u2019t think he may need a lot of money because of the megaphone that he has.7:13: Trump says he would like to see a high-level policy-oriented and says Clinton is weak on borders and ISIS. He cites her vote to go to war in Iraq and her Libya failures.\u00a0Trump says \u201cI\u2019ll see what they do to me.\u201d He says if the Clinton campaign is fair with him, he will be fair with them but he won\u2019t be afraid to bring up Bill Clinton if they don\u2019t treat him properly.7:12: When asked to give a couple words to describe Clinton, Trump says \u201cbad judgment.\u201d He points out that Sanders has also said Clinton has had \u201cbad judgment.\u201d7:11: When asked about some of his unfavorable numbers, Trump says his general election campaign has just gotten started.7:09: Trump again stand by his temporary Muslim ban and doesn\u2019t soften his tone in his mainstream media interview. Trump says we have to be \u201cvigilant\u201d because Islamic terrorism is an \u201curgent\u201d and \u201creal problem\u201d while Obama doesn\u2019t even want to mention \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Trump also says illegal immigrants need to be deported but he says those who have \u201cachieved\u201d will be be allowed to come back.7:08: When asked about some Republicans who were burning their registration cards, Trump mentions that so many more million of people have voted for him. \u201cWe have a lot of new people coming into the party,\u201d he tells NBC\u2019s Lester Holt.7:05: Trump won\u2019t give Lester Hold any names but he says people who have attacked him viciously have called him to say they will endorse him. Trump mentions the importance of Bobby Knight\u2019s endorsement. He says he has not heard from Cruz today and hasn\u2019t spoken to Kasich.7:00: Bushes sitting out this election:6:55: Nikki Haleynot interestedin being Trump\u2019s running mate:\u201cWhile I am flattered to be mentioned and proud of what that says about the great things going on in South Carolina, my plate is full and I am not interested in serving as vice president,\u201d she reportedly said.6:24: Trump says he thinks Clinton is a good debater and will be ready to go one-on-one with her int he fall.6:20: Trump says the last GOP convention was \u201cnot exciting\u201d and he says he wants to put on a convention that \u201cwould make people happy.\u201d He says the last convention was one one of the lowest-rated in history.\u00a0Trump says we have to be cheerleaders for our country and promote the country more. He says he gave the Romney campaign some suggestions four years ago and they didn\u2019t use any of them, and he points out Romney lost a race he should have won.6:19: Trump says \u201cI am who I am\u201d but also says he feels like he is \u201cpresidential.\u201d Trump says he really doesn\u2019t like hitting people first but is a better counter-puncher.6:12: Trump says he will put New York in play. He says he will win upstate New York by \u201cmassive numbers.\u201d He says if he wins New York, he wins the election. He predicts he will win Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida and will \u201cdo very well.\u201d He says he will put states in play that no other Republican will talk about or go to.6:09: Trump says women want \u201csecurity\u201d and a \u201cstrong military\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s health issues taken care of.\u201d He says he is he is going to bring back jobs and says NAFTA was signed by the Clinton administration and has been a \u201ctotal disaster.\u201d6:07: Trump says he has the business end covered and will go the \u201cpolitical route\u201d in choosing a vice president. He says he will be vetting people soon and points out that he wants to get \u201clegislation passed.\u201d He says he will ask Dr. Ben Carson and Chris Christie to be on a selection committee. Trump says he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to releasing his tax return but he is under audit.5:52: Trump predicts that he will get a lot of Sanders supporters and says that Democrats in New York told reporters on local television stations that they wanted to vote for Trump.5:50: Trump says he is \u201cvery different from most Republicans\u201d and says he is looking at perhaps raising the minimum wage above $7.25/hour. He says \u201cyou have to have something you can live on\u201d but says he will bring good jobs so people can make $15/hour but says we can\u2019t \u201cmess around\u201d with the lower number or some companies will not be competitive. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring jobs back to this country,\u201d he says. He says Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d5:46: Trump says he \u201cwe have a really big problem\u201dwith Syrian refugees because we have no idea where they are coming from. He says they have no documentation and he is for a temporary ban until we figure out what is going on. Trump says we can\u2019t be the police of the entire world and seems to suggest that he is willing to let South Korea and Japan become nuclear powers to defend themselves against the North Korean \u201cmaniac\u201d if they don\u2019t pay their fair share for their defense. Trump says Saudi Arabia \u201cwould not be there\u201d if we don\u2019t protect them. He also says China has \u201cno respect\u201d for the United States by building military facilities in the South China Sea.5:45: Trump tells Wolf Blitzer that he would not bail out Puerto Rico. He says he and Putin are \u201cso far off to a good start\u201d because Putin called him a \u201cgenius.\u201d Trump says he would tell Putin to \u201cdon\u2019t do it again\u201d when Blitzer mentioned that Russian fighter jets \u201cbarrel rolled\u201d U.S. aircraft. Trump says it was a sign of disrespect. He says he doesn\u2019t want to say whether he has spoken to Putin when Blitzer asks.5:40: When asked about \u201cvicious\u201d anti-Semitic some of his supporters are making against a reporter, Trump says he doesn\u2019t know about the attacks and doesn\u2019t have a message for those supporters.5:37: Castellanos also points out that Trump can win a general election without winning a significant number of minorities, women, and millennials because he just has to prevent Clinton from running up the score with them.5:35: GOP establishment consultant Alex Castellanos, who unsuccessfully tried to raise money for anti-Trump forces and suggested that the \u201cNever Trump\u201d crowd\u201cshiv him in the ribs\u201dto figuratively take him out like how Brutus killed Caesar, concedes to Chuck Todd on \u201cMTP Daily\u201d that nobody understands understand new media like Trump. He quips that Trump may have done worse if he only had a good media consultant. He says he has a 50-50 chance or better against Clinton and says Clinton has never faced a candidate with \u201c10 arms and eight legs like this.\u201d He notes that Clinton\u2019s \u201cnot a great candidate\u201d and Trump is a \u201cterrific salesman\u201d and a disruptive candidate while Clinton favored taxi cab unions over uber.5:22: Kasich says as he suspends his campaign, he has a renewed faith that the Lord will show him the way forward and fulfill the purpose of his life and \u201cshow me the way forward.\u201d5:20: Kasich says to get more economic growth, politicians have to ignore polls and can\u2019t focus on focus groups while overcoming the fear of reelection or criticism.5:15: Kasich says the people in the country changed him\u00a0and\u00a0reminisces about the hug he got from a supporter on the campaign trail in South Carolina that went viral.5:05: In Ohio, Kasich thanks his wife. He adds that\u00a0nobody has done more with less than his staff. He thanks his volunteers for giving him the \u201coctane\u201d and \u201cfuel\u201d to carry out his purpose. He also thanks his donors. Kasich thanks the people of New Hampshire as well and reminisces about being stuck in traffic in California and spending a \u201cmagical\u201d winter wonderland in the Michigan peninsula. He speaks of the \u201cenergy\u201d of Miami Beach. He says they didn\u2019t think he could make any debate but he made all of them and even \u201cwon\u201d a couple of them. Kasich thanks Ohioans for giving him an opportunity to be a leader in the state and giving him the \u201cgreatest professional experience of my lifetime.\u201d He says he always held \u201cOhio high\u201d and people realized that Ohio was a special place and the state will have more visitors as a result of his campaign.4:50: Kasich getting ready to officially suspend his campaign:4:30: Rush predicts Trump will beat Clinton in\u201clandslide.\u201d4:20: Jim Gilmore, Richard Burr will vote for Trump:3:55: Trumpofficially wins all 57 delegates in Indiana.3:27: Clinton email name-checking establishment Republicans and the GOP \u201cSmart Set.\u201d3:25: GOP establishment consultant John Feehery, who has shown no love for conservatives and Tea Partiers, admitted today on MSNBC that he has been wrong about Donald Trump throughout the election cycle and will support Trump in the general election because \u201cI trust the Republican voters.\u201d He said a \u201ca lotof \u00a0his colleagues in Washington,\u201d though, \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d trust GOP voters who gave them their power. \u00a0He also slammed the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement in his column:I am a Republican.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The #NeverTrump people are either hopelessly na\u00efve, ridiculously idealistic or they are neo-conservatives who figure that Hillary is more pliable when it comes to foreign adventurism.\u00a0 For the neo-cons especially, her vote to go to war in Iraq is the real selling point.[\u2026]Trump is not the perfect candidate, but he is the change candidate. Ask yourself this question: Do the American people want change to come to Washington or do they want to embrace the status quo? You think Trump doesn\u2019t have a chance? Think again.3:05: Kasich doesn\u2019t want to be Trump\u2019s vice president:3:00: Washington Post columnist Milbank\u00a0getting ready to literally eat his words:2:59: Sanders still going.2:45: CNN\u2019s Dana Bash: Hillary Clinton \u201cmissing the point of the Trump candidacy.\u201d Bash points out that voters \u201cdon\u2019t care about experience\u201d and \u201cdetailed policy plans.\u201d Bash notes that Clinton is appealing to the heads of voters while Trump is appealing to their hearts. Gloria Borger rightfully points out on that Clinton is sounding exactly like Jeb Bush (Americans are probably thanking Trump for saving them from a Clinton v. Jeb!\u00a0snoozefest).2:36: Flashback: John McCain repeatedly said Americans needed a \u201csteady hand at the tiller\u201d in his campaign against Obama.

She says the gap between her and Sanders is far wider than it was between Obama and her in 2008.2:27: \u201cNot that I recall,\u201d Clinton says when asked if Trump asked her for favors after he donated to her Senate campaign.2:25: Cooper says Democrats are wondering if Clinton is ready to run a campaign against Trump (he references Trump\u2019s remarks about her husband/marriage), and Clinton nervously laughs. She then talks like a robotic politician and says \u201cif Trump wants to go back to the playbook of the 1990s\u201d and \u201cfollow in the footsteps of those who have tried to knock me down and take me out of the political arena, I\u2019m more than happy to have him do that.\u201d She says she is ready and says \u00a0\u201cthis is to me a classic case of a blistering, bullying guy who has knocked out of the way all of the Republicans because they were dumbfounded\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to deal with him.\u201d Clinton wants voters to get on the \u201cAmerican team\u201d instead of the \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d team.2:21: \u201cI think Elizabeth Warren is really smart,\u201d Clinton says, when asked if she agrees with Warren\u2019s Tweet that Trump is running a racist, sexist, and xenophobic. She says anyone who has listened to Trump speak can draw that conclusion.\u00a0When asked if she thinks Trump is a racist, Clinton simply says, \u201cI\u2019m going to let people judge for themselves, but I have the highest regard for Senator Warren.\u201d2:20: Clinton slams Trump for demeaning women, degrading people with disabilities, and talking about \u201ckeeping Muslims out of the country.\u201d She insists that she is going to keep running her campaign while Trump can run a \u201cbullying\u201d campaign.2:18: Clinton says Trump needs to put some \u201cmeat on the bones\u201d and she says reporters need to ask Trump some tougher questions. Clinton claims she is for \u201cfair and free trade.\u201d She hits Trump for saying that \u201cwages are too high.\u201d2:17: It\u2019s the economy, stupid. Cooper points out that more Americans trust Trump on the economy\u00a0than her. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go back and talk about the history,\u201d Clinton says of the 1990s. She says Trump can argue about the \u201cpeace and prosperity\u201d in the 1990s and she\u2019s going to talk about the future.2:16: When asked again if she is ready for Trump, she says she has been in the arena for more than 20 years and insists that she isn\u2019t running against Trump and is running her own campaign. \u201cI have a very clear mission in this campaign,\u201d she says.2:15: In an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Hillary Clinton says that Trump\u2019s nomination seemed \u201cpretty clear for some time.\u201d She says it didn\u2019t surprise her at all that Trump got the nomination. When asked if she is ready to run against Trump, she says we can\u2019t take a risk on a \u201cloose cannon\u201d like Trump.

Now we are giving you a plan that shows you what we are for.\u00a0Our ambition is a confident America, where everyone has the chance to go out and succeed no matter where they start in life.\u00a0That is the American Idea.\u00a0But right now, the country is on the wrong path.How do we get back on track?Well, we can get angry, and we can stay angry\u2026\u00a0Or we can channel that anger into action\u2026\u00a0We can start to tackle our problems before they tackle us.\u00a0This is what Americans do.We don\u2019t accept decline.\u00a0We don\u2019t give in to division.\u00a0We find a better way.\u00a0Take poverty.\u00a0For years-decades now-Washington has spent trillions of dollars on dozens of programs to fight poverty.\u00a0But we have barely moved the needle.The war on poverty is a stalemate at best.So we can keep doing the same things and getting the same results.\u00a0Or, instead of trapping people in poverty, we can get them on the ladder of opportunity\u2026reward work\u2026open our economy so everyone can make the most of their lives.\u00a0As you will see, this is what our plan does.\u00a0It takes our timeless principles-liberty, free enterprise, consent of the governed-and applies them to the problems of our time.It makes clear what needs to change.\u00a0You will have a clear choice on poverty\u2026jobs\u2026taxes\u2026security\u2026health care\u2026and government itself.\u00a0After decades of executive overreach, it is time we restore our Constitution.\u00a0That means we take control away from unelected bureaucrats, and give it back to the people and their representatives, so we are writing the laws that we live under.All of us-not government-should have the biggest role to play in our lives.\u00a0That\u2019s what this is about.\u00a0That\u2019s why a clear choice is so important.\u00a0Because it is easy to get caught up in all the back-and-forth and the finger-pointing.\u00a0But to do this, to set things right, we need to raise our gaze. We need to go bold.\u00a0This is a chance to pull together and be part of something greater: a more inclusive, more inspiring, a more confident America.\u00a0This is a better way.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter@jeff_poor\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nRyan really believes he's got the power to dictate the agenda.

The mailers also come amid new reports indicating that, one month after his election, Ryan plans to bring up \u201ccriminal sentencing\u201d measures that could release thousands of\u00a0criminal illegal aliens from prison onto the streets.\u201cKeeping America safe is a big job. And it\u2019s the most important one there is,\u201d the Ryan mailer reads. \u201cProtect our Homeland\u2014 that means securing the border, confronting Islamic Terrorism, and tackling new threats by stopping them from reaching our shores\u2026 Paul Ryan for U.S. Congress\u2026 Vote Tuesday, August 9th\u201dHowever, new reports indicate that\u00a0immediately\u00a0following his primary election, Speaker Ryan plans to bring up legislation that could release thousands of criminal illegal aliens from prison and into American communities.AsRollCallreports, \u201cThe House will take up legislation to overhaul the criminal justice system in September, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said.\u201dLast October, the President of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Union\u2014 which represents approximately 5,800 frontline ICE officers, agents and personnel who are responsible for enforcing America\u2019s immigration laws\u2014 wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing opposition to the so-called \u201ccriminal sentencing reform\u201d measures.The ICE Union warned that some of the discussed proposals could result in the \u201cmass release of criminal aliens from federal prison.\u201d ICE highlighted the proposal\u2019s impact on public safety, and noted that it could \u201cfurther hampe[r] immigration enforcement within the United States.\u201d\u201cAccording to a recent article in theWashington Post, 1 in 3 of the 6,000 federal prisoners that the Department of Justice recently handpicked for early release is an alien,\u201d wrote ICE Council President Chris Crane.\u00a0\u201cI understand that both houses of Congress are also exploring legislative measures that could lead to the release of additional criminal aliens. Notably, these releases will be in addition to the thousands of criminal aliens who are being released into communities from sanctuary jurisdictions across the country every month.\u201d\u201cCountless preventable crimes against children, rapes, robberies and murders will most likely occur as a result of these proposed mass release,\u201d Crane added.Interestingly, Ryan\u2019s mailer does not list a single action Ryan has actually taken\u2014in his seventeen years in Congress\u2014 to \u201csecure our border\u201d or stop the threat of radical Islam from \u201creaching our shores.\u201dWhile Ryan is now sending out mailers on border security, he has spenttwo decades pushing for policiesthat would effectively\u00a0open America\u2019s borders\u2014including actions he has taken from his powerful position as House Speaker.As House Speaker, Ryan ushered through Congress anomnibus spending billthat completely funded President Obama\u2019s open borders agenda.Ryanvotedto fund Obama\u2019s still-running 2012 executive amnesty for illegal aliens who allegedly entered the country as minors.\u00a0Ryan\u2019s bill\u00a0also rewarded sanctuary cities with federal grants. He also provided\u00a0funding for the resettlement of illegal aliens within the United States, the release of criminal aliens, and tax credits for illegal aliens.Ryan\u2019s spending bill alsofunded an expansion of Muslim migration, bringing the total number of visas for Muslim migrants this year (temporary and permanent) to nearly 300,000.Ryan has voted to increase Muslim migration\u2014 despite the fact thatseven out of ten GOP Wisconsin voterswant to see Muslim migration into the United States paused.Ryan\u2019s primary challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, slammed Ryan for the deceptive mailers.\u201cThe only thing more\u00a0disturbing than Paul Ryan\u2019s refusal to secure\u00a0the border is the extent to which he is comfortable lying about it,\u201d Nehlen said.\u201cAs long as Paul Ryan is in Congress, immigration will never be reduced, the border will never be secured, radical Islam will never be kept off our shores, and our children will never be safe,\u201d Nehlen continued. \u201cHe is wholly owned by his donors, and his donors want open borders. When was the last time Ryan ever fought hard for something that his donors opposed? If Ryan remains, we can kiss our borders, our safety, and our sovereignty goodbye.\u201dThis is not the first time Ryan\u2019s\u00a0controversial position on immigration has been misrepresented to the Republican electorate. In 2013,\u00a0an affiliate of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decidedly pro-amnesty lobbying group ran anad defending Ryanand claiming that Ryan opposes \u201camnesty.\u201dPoliticoreportedthat \u201cthe spot from the FWD.us affiliate begins with a picture of Ryan and says, \u2018Amnesty? Not a chance,\u2019 and goes on to say the House budget chairman is looking at a \u2018conservative solution\u2019 to the issue of immigration.\u201d\u00a0Zuckerberg\u2019s pro-amnesty groupspent$350,000 on the ad-buy to convince conservative voters that Ryan does not support amnesty\u2014 even though Ryan supports giving citizenship to\u00a0illegal\u00a0immigrants.\u201cOpen Borders is in his ideological DNA,\u201d NumbersUSA President, Roy Beck, has explained. \u201cOpen borders seeps out of every pore of his being. This isn\u2019t personal, it\u2019s just who he is\u2026 Paul Ryan is the heart and soul of crony capitalism.\u201dIndeed, a2015 PBS documentaryrevealed the full extent to Ryan\u2019s efforts to pass President Obama\u2019s immigration agenda.The documentary revealed that between 2013 to 2014, Ryan worked with open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez to push the Rubio-Obama amnesty agenda.\u00a0Gutierrez has previouslysaid, \u201cI have only one loyalty\u2026and that\u2019s to the immigrant community\u201d.During the 2013 push to pass amnesty, Ryantolda group of Hispanic voters that he believes his job of a U.S. lawmaker is to put himself in the shoes of foreign citizens living in foreign countries\u2014 such as a \u201cgentleman from India who\u2019s waiting for his green card\u201d or the illegal alien \u201cDREAMer who is waiting\u2014 and put forth U.S. legislative solutions to improve the lives of those foreign citizens.At a joint event with Gutierrez in 2013,\u00a0Ryan made the case for dissolving borders\u2014declaringunabashedly that the United States \u201cis more than [its] borders.\u201dTwo years later, Gutierrez was one of Ryan\u2019searliest endorsementsfor House Speaker.\u201cPaul Ryan and I talk,\u201d Gutierreztoldthe filmmakers in 2014. \u201cWhat we do with Ryan,\u201d Gutierrez explained, \u201cis he puts together a bunch of bills, one of which is legalization, and that\u2019s the one we join him on. The legalization is good enough that I can go and say we need to get in bed.\u201dGutierrez told filmmakers that their collaboration had to be conducted in secret, so as not to tip off Republican voters. \u201cYou feel like you have to kind of sneak around to have dinner with these guys,\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s communications director, Douglas Rivlin, said, referring to his secret meetings with House Republicans to push amnesty.\u00a0\u201cUnlike some of you[expletive deleted],I don\u2019t mess around with my wife, so\u2013but let me tell you\u2013right? I feel like I\u2019m sneaking around right on my Party \u2026 when I have dinner with you guys,\u201d he said.\u201cRight,\u201d Gutierrez confirmed. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell people. That\u2019s OK. Maybe that\u2019s the way this has got to get done. But if those are the rules, those are the rules.\u201dIt is perhaps interesting that Ryan is now choosing to campaign on border security given that he has taken so many actions throughout his career to effectively dissolve national borders.In doing so, Ryan appears to be taking a page out of the campaign playbook of ex-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. In 2014, when Cantor\u2019s primary race began heating up in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, Cantor\u2019s\u00a0campaign began distributing misleading mailers claiming that the pro-amnesty House Majority Leader was actually opposed to amnesty.AsBreitbart Newsreportedat the time, \u201cHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) is at it again. After sending adeceptive anti-amnesty mailerlast week to voters, Cantor\u2019s campaignsent out anotherthis week just days before his June 10 primary against Dave Brat, who has been attacking Cantor on immigration. The new mailer touts the \u201cconservative\u201d Eric Cantor who is \u201cstopping\u201d the \u201cObama-Reid plan to give illegal aliens amnesty.\u2019\u201dInterestingly, like Ryan, Eric Cantor similarly had joined forces with Gutierrez to push amnesty. Cantor \u201cwent on a tour with Rep. Luis Gutierrez\u2026 to promote amnesty legislation in New York,\u201d Breitbart reported prior to Cantor\u2019s historic loss.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2787412411\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt's the same in Cali.

The details have not yet been confirmed.Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann was being briefed about the incident, the spokesman said.The Nuernberger Nachrichten newspaper reported that the blast occurred at a restaurant in Ansbach.https://twitter.com/GoldenKrant/status/757346120670511104Germany\u2019s NTV television reported that officials suspected the explosion was caused by a gas leak.Questions will now be raised as to how the man remained in Germany, and what German authorities are doing toReuters and AP contributed to this report\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2801701558\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSilly people!!

Last month, Reiner appeared onCNN Tonightandsaidthe real danger in\u00a0Trump\u2019s words are that his followers \u201chave a violent nature, and a violent streak.\u201dThe formerAll in the Familystar\u2019s disdain for Trump supporters is, however, rivaled only by his hatred for the White House hopeful himself.In an appearance on MSNBC in July, ReinercalledTrump \u201cthe single most unqualified person ever to run for president in my lifetime.\u201dReiner, who also\u00a0toldTHRthat the iconic character Archie Bunker would be a Trump supporter, is an enthusiastic supporter\u00a0of Trump\u2019s Democratic rival in the 2016 race.\u201cI\u2019ve known Hillary Clinton almost 25 years, and she\u2019s incredibly dedicated and passionate about wanting to make things better and wanting to move thing forward,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a real policy wonk. She can work across the aisle. She\u2019s good at it. Once she has a job, Republicans like her because she does listen and figures out ways to forge consensus.\u201dReiner said it\u2019s his \u201cdream that she wins the White House,\u201d and also admitted that \u201cit may just be pie-in-the sky, but that\u2019s my hope.\u201dAsked if there\u2019s anything that could keep Hillary from winning in November, Reiner said, \u201cThe only thing I could think of is some Julian Assange thing,\u201d referencing the\u00a0notorious WikiLeaks founder, whose infamous non-profit publisher of corporate and secret government documents recently released scores of emails that embarrassed the Democratic National Committee\u00a0and resulted in theresignation of former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.FollowJerome Hudsonon Twitter:@jeromeehudson\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe Hollywood commies are self destructing!

Mexican cartel smugglers have taken full advantage of the system in order to maximize their profits from human smuggling as well as the smuggling of illegal aliens. In 2014, Mexico\u2019s Gulf Cartel was able tomake approximately $38 million in a matter of months off human smuggling alone.According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, of the 194,726 detained illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico, 125,032 have been apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley (64 percent).The most recent figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection revealed that in the 2016 fiscal year, authorities have encountered 68,080 family units, the term used to describe underage immigrants accompanied by at least one adult relative. That figure is already higher than the 66,144 family units apprehended in 2014. In the case of underage immigrants, during 2016, authorities have apprehended 54,052, in comparison to the 66,115 underage immigrants detained in 2014.The record-setting immigration issue, along with the lack of resources, is something agents have been warning about for some time. In May, Breitbart Texas reported on the spike inunderage illegal immigrants being apprehended at the border. At the time, members of the National Border Patrol Council sounded the alarm.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this since the summer of 2014. The flow is increasing at an alarming rate. If we don\u2019t do something to stem the massive influx, we will likely see numbers that eclipse those of 2014,\u201d said US Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera speaking as Vice President for the NBPC Local 3307. \u201cThe cartel groups are tying us up on one end with the family groups and running their narcotics because we are caught up doing babysitting duties.\u201dEarlier this year, Breitbart Texas reported on how in theLaredo sector authorities had managed to apprehend 18,000 illegal immigrantsin just five months. As Breitbart Texas has reported in the past,Laredo is one of the least secure border regionsdue to its proximity to populated areas, lack of physical barriers, limited use of technology and its diminished number of agents in the field.In the Mexican border city of Reynosa, the criminal organization known as the Gulf Cartel has set up stash houses throughout the region to hold illegal immigrants in preparation for their trip over the river into Texas. The immigrants are taken west towards the area immediately south of Starr County. The area has been a bustling corridor due to its lack of physical barriers and its limited patrolling.Last month, avan carrying 26 illegal immigrants from Central American countries crashedalong a Mexican highway near Reynosa. The van had an armed escort that fled the scene. Five immigrants died at the scene of the crash and a sixth one died days later. In June, Breitbart Texas reported on how Mexican authorities had been able todetain dozens of illegal immigrants at those stash houses in Mexico.Once the cartel smugglers are able to bring illegal aliens over the Rio Grande, they move them to stash houses on the U.S. side where they hold them until they can be moved to their final destination. The journey to the stash house presents a security issued for individuals on the U.S side of the border. Breitbart Texas previously reported, if encountered by law enforcement,human smugglers routinely flee and start high speed chases through small border citiessuch as La Joya, Sullivan City and others. The chases have often resulted in tragic crashes that have left dozens injured and resulted in multiple fatalities.Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Well, one clue in a new poll indicates that one-third of viewers are changing the channel over the anti-American protests during the national anthem.A newRasmussen pollfinds that 32 percent of adults surveyed say that they have stopped watching NFL football because of the protests while only a scant 13 percent said they are more likely to tune in because of the anthem protests.Drilling down into the results shows that more women than men are tired of the Black Lives Matter-like protests with 29 percent of men saying they are less likely to watch pro\u00a0football\u00a0compared to 38 percent of women, who intimated that they are uncomfortable with the protests.The NFL preseason kicked off in controversy when San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to remain seated during the playing of the national anthem instead of standing in honor of the nation\u2019s theme like everyone else was.As the weeks rolled on and Kaepernick began kneeling on the field during the regular season,\u00a0his protest spread not only throughout the NFL but into other sports.As the season rolls into Week Five, though, television ratings have been seen tumbling each week to new lows.The ratings for Week Three\u2019s Sunday featured game between Chicago and Dallas measured in at 12.9 in the Neilsen ratings. This is down from the previous Sunday\u2019s 13.7 and that was down from week one\u2019s 13.9 rating. Ratings also dropped by 18 percent over week three from last year for all the midday regional games,according to Sports Business Daily.The ratings forMonday Night Footballare\u00a0even worse. The game between Atlanta and New Orleans received a low 5.7 rating. It was a 38 percent plunge over the same week last year.During these protests, Colin Kaepernick\u2019s reputation has also taken a major hit. Since he started his rants against America, he has becomethe most hated playerin the NFL.Despite that, Kaepernick has continued his anti-American attacks even off the field. Recently he attacked the U.S. saying it has never been great as he talked about Donald Trump\u2019s now well-loved slogan.\u201cHe always says, \u2018Make America great again,'\u201dKaepernick saidabout Trump.\u00a0\u201cWell, America has never been great for people of color and that\u2019s something that needs to be addressed. Let\u2019s make America great for the first time.\u201dKaepernick\u2019s hate for the country has spread to other sports, andeven high schools, have begun indulging these protests. And just last weekenda college marching band drew criticismfrom its own school administrators for taking a knee during the national anthem.But, if the news on the ratings are any indication, Americans are beginning to get fed up with the constant drumbeat of liberal politics shoehorned into their once beloved forms of apolitical entertainment.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthustonor email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAccording to NFL officials, the negative publicity is not the cause of the loss of viewers.

The migrants denied the attack and it was said that as the woman did not resist sufficiently, the incident can not be classed as rape according to Swedish law.\u201cThe act is not based on violence or threats without having exhausted her special situation,\u201d prosecutor Mats WihlborgtoldAftonbladet, claiming the \u201cclaimant\u2019s story is not so robust that it can be the basis for an arrest\u201d.Hundreds of local residents took matters into their own hands, protesting outside the migrant centre on more than one occasion, sending the town into chaos such that extra police had to be brought in from other regions.The victim\u2019s lawyer, Staffan Fredriksson, argued that the disabled women was \u201cparalyzed\u201d and could not have fought back. He said:\u201cShe followed him in and had no fears that something would happen. Then the man took advantage of the situation. The abuse started in the toilet.\u201cWhere they came from we don\u2019t know. This was going on for a couple of hours. She got paralyzed in this situation and was not able to bring herself to resist physically, other than saying no.\u201dHe added: \u201cShe is completely broken down.\u201dSweden accepted more so-called refugees per capita that any other European nation last year and the liberal government is now facing a backlash.At the beginning of this month, it wasreportedthat the proportion of Swedes who want their country to accept fewer refugees has almost doubled in a year, meaning a strong majority \u2013 60 per cent \u2013 now support slashing immigration.In contrast, only 13 per cent said they thought more refugees should be accepted \u2013 more than halving from 31 per cent in 2015.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2947143540\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt's already in America!

Trump:The rise of Donald Trump has given Paul Ryan heartburn all year. And that may not change after Election Day.The GOP presidential nominee has repeatedly accused Ryan, the nation\u2019s highest-ranking elected Republican, of being disloyal to his campaign.If Trump is trounced by Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, many believe he\u2019ll turn his wrath \u2014 and his millions of loyal followers \u2014 against Ryan as he runs for reelection as Speaker.Trump already appears to be looking for ways to explain his potential loss in the White House race.Fox News host Sean Hannity, an ally of Trump, is dialing up the rhetoric against Ryan, telling The Washington Post this week that the Wisconsin lawmaker is a \u201csaboteur\u201d who \u201cneeded to be called out and replaced.\u201dAnd last Friday, top leaders of the far-right House Freedom Caucus held a conference call in which they discussed backing a challenger to Ryan in the Speaker\u2019s race, set for one week after the election, The Hill has learned. Some lawmakers are floating caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), though his aides said he won\u2019t run.\u201cA lot of conservatives are hearing in great volume back in their districts calls to dump Ryan. If we don\u2019t have somebody that runs against him, it makes us look like we\u2019re complicit,\u201d said a lawmaker on the Freedom Caucus call.\u201cI think it is a pretty sure bet there will be an opponent to the Speaker in November.\u201dRead the rest of the storyhere.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2962989508\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n???\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

The much anticipated \u201cmedia-wide bidding war for Kelly\u201d has not materialized, due perhaps to the lackluster ratings performance of her \u201cheavily promoted prime time interview with Trump.\u201dFromVanity Fair:Kelly\u2019s imminent free agency has been the talk of the very chatty TV-news business. By late summer,\u00a0James Murdoch\u00a0and\u00a0Lachlan Murdoch, the C.E.O. and co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, respectively, appeared hellbent on re-signing the anchor. Not only was Kelly a meaningful symbol of a post-Ailes culture within the Fox News bunker, but her ratings were also key to preserving Ailes\u2019s estimated $1.5 billion profit machine, which the younger Murdochs were now tasked with maintaining. It didn\u2019t seem to matter that Kelly clashed with O\u2019Reilly, whose own contract expires at the end of 2017. It was clear that the Murdoch sons favored Kelly. They invited her to dinner parties at their homes. They seemed poised to put her on par with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s much larger compensation package, and possibly top his haul, which has beenreportedto be in the neighborhood of $20 million per year. \u201cIt was a perfect storm for her,\u201d said a rival news executive, \u201cand she has made the most of it.\u201d According to multiple people familiar with the discussions, representatives for the network have offered Kelly a compensation package north of the $20 million per year. (A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment.)Indeed, the headlines over the past weeks, includingat the Hive, have anticipated a frenzied, industry-wide bidding war for Kelly.\u00a0In my reporting on the negotiations, virtually every news executive appeared to be pointing to another rival news executive whom they believed would be making a major play for her.\u2026But so far, the purported auction for Kelly\u2019s services has not come to fruition. One CNN insider explained, \u201cof course we would love to have her,\u201d before noting that poaching Kelly, given the likely cost of her contract, \u201cis not something we are seriously considering.\u201d Instead, this person elaborated, CNN is investing more in documentary-style programming after the election. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone is pursuing her other than Fox at this point,\u201d said one ABC insider. A source close to CBS said that they are not making an offer, either. (The person close to Kelly noted that discussions with rival executives were ongoing.)In fact, Kelly\u2019s attempt to spread her wings and show that she is more than just a nightly cable-news host may work against her. An executive close to ABC told me that Kelly\u2019s performance during herheavily promotedprime-time interview with Trump was particularly damaging to her perceived ability to \u201ctranslate\u201d to a morning show, where anchors are typically paid more handsomely than their prime-time counterparts. For Kelly, the Trump interview was intended to patch up her feud with the candidate and show her softer side. But the event was a critical and ratings disappointment. After that, \u201cit was never a sort of concerted effort to think about what [Kelly] could look like [at ABC],\u201d the executive told me.Read the resthere.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe Murdoch brothers ar fools for giving Kelly \"north of $20 million.\"    One can only take so much of the Trump bashing.

The increase is equivalent to the nation of just 9.5 million people building a whole new capital city Stockholm by 2020.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3028983784\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhen they all become voters, they'll own Sweden!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

The behind-the-scenes tours and security briefings of the Minneapolis airport very well could have created a threat to public safety,\u201d he said.The material that was withheld fromJudicial Watchincluded a section entitled: \u201cTSA Overview \u2014 Processing [Redacted].\u201d The invitees were provided briefings of theGlobal Entry system, theAutomated Passport Controlsystem, secondary screening procedures, baggage-screening procedures, and given tours of the holding cells and interview rooms.The records came in response to a May 2016 Freedom of Information Actrequest, which sought records, documents, and communications regarding a Feb. 18\u00a0\u201cCommunity Engagement Tour\u201d in Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport.The tour program came to the attention of Judicial Watch after one of the tours was the subject of a post atPowerLinebyScott W. Johnson.Mohamed Farahis one of the \u201cMinnesota men\u201d charged with seeking to join ISIS. His trial is set for the second week of May before Judge Micheal Davis. Imam and law school graduate Hassan Mohamud is a member of Farah\u2019s defense team. Judge Davis has set a hearing on the possible disqualification of Mohamud from Farah\u2019s defense team for preaching jihad. I wrote about the hearing in \u201cJihad on the defense team.\u201dIn its article on the matter,theStar Tribunementions in passing: \u201cMohamud was uninvited from a behind-the-scenes security tour with about 50 imams and other members of the Muslim community at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.\u201dEight senior rankingHomeland SecurityandCustoms and Border Protectionofficials were tasked with accompanying and briefing the Somalis on the Feb. 18, Minneapolis airport tour, including the Minneapolis-area port director, the assistant port director, the watch commander; and from theTransportation Security Administration,the local federal security directorand\u00a0deputy. A Homeland Security Departmentcivil liberties senior policy adviserwas also flown in from Washington.In addition to the tours at the three airports, the federal officials encouraged the Somalis to apply for jobs with federal law enforcement and security agencies.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt's quite doubtful this was Fed's \"recklessness.\" Fact is Obama has many Muslim appointees to key positions in government agencies, one if them at the DHS. Is it surprising that his administration put our country's security at risk? We can't get rid of Obama soon enough.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence over the Trump administration\u2019s vow to tackle corruption in Big Pharma.Trump promised during his press conference in New York City at Trump Tower last week to reform the pharmaceutical industry to ensure proper bidding procedures take place\u2014among other reforms to the major industry\u2014moving forward.\u201cWe have to get our drug industry coming back,\u201d Trumpsaidat the press conference. \u201cOur drug industry has been disastrous. They\u2019re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs but they don\u2019t make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because they\u2019re getting away with murder. Pharma has a lot of lobbies, a lot of lobbyists, a lot of power. And there\u2019s very little bidding on drugs. We\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don\u2019t bid properly. We\u2019re going to start bidding. We\u2019re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.\u201dLater,in an interview with the Washington Post, Trump doubled down on his criticisms of Big Pharma. \u201cThey\u2019re politically protected, but not anymore,\u201d Trump said in that interview of drug companies.Trump\u2019s comments sent the pharmaceutical industry,according to Fortune Magazine, into a financial tailspin. So naturally, Ryan\u2013the donor class\u2019s representative in Washington\u2013rode into the rescue and to fight Trump.Ryan, in response in an interview with Mike Allen of Axios, said that he wants to \u201chave more conversations about\u201d Trump\u2019s efforts to crack down on Big Pharma corruption before the president-elect\u2014soon to be president\u2014does so.\u201cI believe that the current premium support system with Part D works extremely well,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI think there\u2019s some real success stories \u2026 and I think we need to tell that story.\u201dWhen asked by Allen if that also means telling such stories to Trump, he replied that the story needs to be told to \u201ca lot of people.\u201d\u201cI think [incoming Health and Human Services Secretary] Tom Price understands this issue extremely well,\u201d Ryan said.When asked specifically about Trump\u2019s Washington Post comments about how the drug companies are \u201cpolitically protected, but not anymore\u201d under Trump\u2019s administration, Ryan replied: \u201cI don\u2019t speak like that, generally speaking. I\u2019m always looking for win-win situations, and I believe there\u2019s a lot more we can do to bring down the price of drugs.\u201dThe tension is yet another example of where Trump\u2019s populist nationalism\u2014he\u2019s a president for the working class, and wants to stand up for American workers against world financial, cultural and political elites\u2014is rubbing up against Ryan\u2019s globalist elitism. Ryan is someone who is joined at the hip with the donor class, and hardly ever does anything anymore because he thinks it\u2019s the right thing to do: Ryan\u2019s motives are usually on behalf of whoever is funding Republican campaigns including his own, but he;s also driven by his open borders, elitist ideology. Expect more clashes soon.Then, as the interview Ryan did with Allen seeps in throughout Washington, his office released a video of him showing Trump, incoming First Lady Melania Trump and incoming Vice President Mike Pence a view from the Speaker\u2019s balcony at the U.S. Capitol in a seeming attempt to smooth things over with Trump and Pence.While the video makes it look like they\u2019re getting along, sources in both camps tell Breitbart News to not expect this bromance to last.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3104312912\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe American Cancer Society has been around since I've been alive, which is a long time, and they are still soliciting money for cancer research.

Ted Cruz revved up hundreds of Tea Party activists at Wednesday\u2019s \u201cStorm Congress\u201d rally against the American Health Care Act crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.) to stabilize health insurance markets, rather than repeal the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.\u201cThank you for braving the cold and thank you for standing up and fighting for freedom,\u201d saidCruz, who was on a roster of speakers that included Sen. Rand Paul (R.-Ky.), Jenny Beth Martin \u2014\u00a0the leader of the Tea Party Patriots \u2014\u00a0and members of the House Freedom Caucus. The rally was organized by FreedomWorks, the Washington-based policy and logistics hub for Tea Party and conservative activists. The master of ceremonies was Andrew Wilkow, the host of the XMSirius radio showThe Wilkow Majority.\u201cIn November Democrats were shocked, the media was shocked\u2013although I repeat myself, and millions of hard-working Americans across this country rose up and said: \u2018Enough is enough and we have a mandate for change.'\u201dCruz said Republicans promised for more than six years that if the voters gave them control of the House, Senate, and White House, the GOP would repeal Obamacare.Now, the GOP controls Congress and the White House, he said. \u201cWell, you know what? We\u2019re out of excuses. The time for talk is over. Now, is the time for action.\u201dAfter the rally,FreedomWorksstaffers escorted teams of activists to\u00a0meetings with congressmen and senators, where they advocated for a clean repeal of Obamacare, instead of the bill Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.) crafted \u2014 the American Health Care Act, or RyanCare.The RyanCare bill does not repeal and replace the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Rather it keeps its structure and programs in place. Central to the bill is the support it provides to the insurance companies by preserving the Individual Mandate as a program administered by the insurance companies and the cutbacks to Medicaid. The expansion of Medicaid pulled millions of lower income insurance customers out of the private market, which drastically changed business conditions for the insurance companies.Now that the American Health Care Act passed the House Budget Committee, the bill is in front of the House Rules Committee, which is tasked with providing the conditions for the bill\u2019s debate on the House floor. As RyanCare moved through the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees, it remained unchanged from the exact text the speaker\u2019s office posted March 6 at 6 p.m. Whether or not the Rules committee allows amendments on the House floor will signal if the speaker has the votes to muscle through his text unaltered.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nRyan should get out of the way.

The source added\u00a0that Mr. Cornell \u201cfelt very stuck\u2019 over the situation. \u201cTarget didn\u2019t adequately assess the risk, and the ensuing backlash was self-inflicted, he told staff. Now, it was too late to reverse course,\u201d the paper reported. The decision was announced via the company\u2019s website and social media accounts. In the ensuing weeks, Cornell\u00a0publiclyannounced his unqualified supportof the policy and defended it on multiple occasions.When the North Carolina legislature passed its sexual-privacy HB2 bathroom bill in April of 2016, Target jumped out as the first major corporation to give full-throated support for theunpopular transgender claimthat men who say they are women should be allowed to use women\u2019s bathrooms and changing rooms.The company\u2019s revenues, profits, and stock value dropped quickly after the announcement, which said that store managers would eliminate single-sex bathrooms and changing rooms to help provide a welcoming atmosphere for transgender customers who comprise far less than 1 percent of the population. The company sank faster oncea major boycottof Target was launched by the American Family Association, whose petition garnered over a million signatures in a matter of weeks.At first, Cornell explained away the lost customers as a result of the \u201charsh winter weather\u201d experienced across the nation over the 2016 winter months. But that excuse quickly began to look increasingly absurd as the company\u2019s profit margins and stock prices continued to fall in each of the succeeding months through the year and even into 2017.Target stock quote, courtesy of YahooOther national retailers experienced ups and downs over the same period, Target\u2019s profits and stocks fell much harder than its competitors and continued to fall after the others began seeing some improvement.By February of this year, Target had experienceda $15 billion loss. But the fall continued. By March of this year, Target\u2019sstock price had fallento roughly $53 a share, down from its 2016 high of $84 a share.While many other U.S. retailers have similar policies, only Target made a big spectacle out of the decision. According to theJournal, Target essentially made the bold announcement that anyone who disagrees with its policy is a bigot.\u201cTarget picked a side and pretty much said to the rest of us that we don\u2019t matter,\u201d customer Mary McCandless of Winston-Salem, N.C. told the told a pollster cited by theJournal. \u201cThey should have just left it as, \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t show, don\u2019t tell.'\u201dThe company has seen such a troubled economic outlook thatit droppedseveral high profile, but costly, projects upon which it had pinned its hopes for future growth. The announcement of the shuttering of the two major expansion projects came as a sudden and unexpected move to analysts.By contrast, even as Target has taken a continued beating, the State ofNorth Carolina didn\u2019t experience much of an economic hit at all, even with multiple boycotts by sports teams and entertainers.Despite the failure of the boycotts to have economic consequences, local business groups pressure GOP leaders and the new Democratic governor to write a new law. That new law, HB-142,preserves the state\u2019s support for sexual privacyin bathrooms, despite pressure from Democrats allied with the transgender movement.The state\u2019s new law is a big win for voters and legislators around the country who wish to block the effort by \u201cgender identity\u201d activists to eliminate legal and civic distinctions between the equal, popular and complementary preferences of men and women, such as single-sex bathrooms. In general, gay and transgender activists are trying to impose a \u201c\u2018genderless society\u201d on Americans, in which the government would encourage damaging lawsuits against any facility or group that recognizes the differences between the two sexes. Unfortunately for Target and its shareholders, several top level managers support that \u201cgenderless society\u201d agendaUnfortunately for Target and its shareholders,several top managers at the companywere pushing that \u201cgenderless society\u201d agenda in April 2016 when they wrecked the company\u2019s stock value by declaring the company\u2019s support for transgender bathrooms and changing rooms.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthustonor email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThis CEO should have been fired.

Times.Vidal-Jaime has been living in the U.S. since 2001 and her husband, Hugo Rueda, was arrested for drug possession by officials in the raid, where Rueda\u2019s car allegedly had 33 pounds of cocaine in it, and the couple\u2019s apartment had $600,000 cash inside, along with an ounce of crystal methamphetamine.Federal officials believe Rueda is involved with the cross-border U.S.-Mexico drug trade.Vidal-Jaime is the mother of Los Angeles immigration activist Claudia Rueda, who claims her mother was detained by authorities illegally, despite her mother\u2019s illegal immigrant status.A small open-borders rally was held at the Border Patrol station in San Ysidro near San Diego, with \u201cFree Teresa now\u201d chants from protesters.An organizer of the protest told theL.A. Timesthat not only should Vidal-Jaime not have been detained, but she also claimed federal authorities arrested the woman because her daughter is an activist against immigration enforcement.\u201cWe think it is retaliation against her mother for her daughter\u2019s activism,\u201d Marcela Hernandez said.In a statement to theL.A. Times, Claudia Rueda said authorities should let her mother out of federal custody.\u201cDespite being told she would not be detained as long she cooperated, my mother was apprehended during an illegally conducted raid at my apartment,\u201d Rueda said.\u201cI know my mother is innocent, and both [the Sheriff\u2019s Department and Border Patrol] know that, which is why they were supposed to let her go,\u201d Rueda continued.Vidal-Jaime is awaiting a deportation hearing before an immigration judge and is expected to be deported.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

He said:We are compelled to deny Mr. Magana Ortiz\u2019s request for a stay of removal because we do not have the authority to grant it. We are not, however, compelled to find the government\u2019s action in this case fair or just. \u2026The government\u2019s decision to remove Magana Ortiz diminishes not only our country but our courts, which are supposedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice. Magana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only victims. Among the others are judges who, forced to participate in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity as well. I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not.The judge, who was appointed \u2014 not elected \u2014 in 1980 and is married to a former top leader in the ACLU, also lamented the authority of ordinary DHS agents to enforce the law despite protests from well-paid, high-status \u201ccivil rights\u201d lawyers:On January 25, 2017, the President [Donald Trump] signed a series of executive orders dismantling the system of priorities that had previously guided Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol in determining whom to deport. The orders also gave far greater authority to individual agents and officers, who are now removing non-citizens simply because they are here illegally, regardless of whether they have committed any offense. In light of the breadth of these orders and the lack of any apparent limit on agents\u2019 discretion, the undocumented must now choose between going to work, school, hospitals, and even court, and the risk of being seized.In contrast, the new Supreme Court Justice appointed by Trump,Neil Gorsuch, has a more humble vision of his job as a judicial referee, saying ina 2013 award ceremonythat:As my daughters remind me, donning a [judicial] robe doesn\u2019t make me any smarter \u2026 It serves as a reminder of what\u2019s expected of us\u2014what [Irish philosopher Edmund] Burke called the \u201ccold neutrality of an impartial judge.\u201d It serves, too, as a reminder of the relatively modest station we\u2019re meant to occupy in a democratic society. In other places, judges wear scarlet and ermine. Here, we\u2019re told to buy our own plain black robes \u2014 and I can attest the standard choir outfit at the local uniform supply store is a good deal. Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester.The judges on Reinhardt\u2019s Ninth Circuit are expected to release soon a decision blocking Trump\u2019s Executive Orders limiting the entry of people from six terror-prone Muslim countries. The decision is based\u00a0on a Hawaiian case, in which an Egyptian-born Islamic cleric claimed his constitutional rights were infringed by Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce Islamic jihad\u00a0in the United States.The court\u2019s\u00a0decision may have been delayed by the Islam-inspired bloody attacks in Manchester and London, at least one of which was conducted by the sons of Muslim refugees and migrants from Libya.Reinhardt\u2019s intemperate language, said Andrew Arthur, a formerimmigration judge, suggests that the court\u2019s decisions are political biased. \u201cThere is no \u2018cold neutrality\u2019 in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling,\u201dArthur wrote about the court\u2019s preliminary ruling in the Hawaii\u00a0case. \u201cIt is personal, visceral, and vindictive.\u201d\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nReinhardt and all the left wing political judges disrespect our Constitution and the rule of law.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) stood on an empty New York stage, reading excerpts from her latest book,This Fight is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class, and could hardly restrain her excitement while reading what sounded like awarningfor President Donald Trump: \u201cDonald, you ain\u2019t seen nasty yet.\u201dWarren wasreportedlyreading some of her favorite anti-Trump signs from the nationally-coordinated Women\u2019s March in Boston, Massachusetts, when she said, \u201cAnd only one more\u00a0because I have to discipline myself on this. This is a good sign: \u2018Donald, you ain\u2019t seen nasty yet.'\u201dThe phrase \u201cnasty woman,\u201d quickly became a slogan after Trump uttered the phrase during the final presidential debate following Hillary Clinton\u2019s remarks that she would raise taxes on the rich in order to pay for the nation\u2019s mounting debt. \u201cMy Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald\u2019s, assuming he can\u2019t figure out how to get out of it,\u201d Clinton said at the time. Trump moved into his microphone and said in response, \u201csuch a nasty woman.\u201dWarren was speaking atThe Town Hall, a New York City-based performance space Friday evening. Those who chose to watch Warren read portions from her book and answer questions, instead of attending\u00a0a rendition ofJulius Caesarin which\u00a0President Trump is killed off, could have paid $45-$50per ticketto do so.Another one of her favorite signs was reportedly, \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are not up for grabs.\u201d In a video, she can be seen\u00a0saying, \u201cWhatDonald Trumpand the Republican majority in the House and the Senate want to do to us, is they want to deliver the knockout blow to the middle class.\u201dTrump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin \u2014 a longtimedonor to the Democratic Party\u2014 has stated that Trump\u2019s tax plan is meant to help the middle class and strengthen free market competition.The far-left senator and former Harvard law professor went on to say, \u201cThe character of a nation is not the character of its president. The character of a nation is the character of its people.\u201dWarren read a paragraph from her book that documented her emotion from the Women\u2019s March in the state she represents. \u201cAs I marched in Boston with tens of thousands of others that day, I had no illusions. I\u00a0knew it would be a hard fight. I knew there would be dark moments. But I knew that we had tens of millions of people with us, and this fight would be our fight.\u201dWarren, who has said she won\u2019trun for presidentin 2020, recently said she hopes Republicans would \u201cleave their bodies to science\u201d because she \u201cwould like to cut them open.\u201dDuring a 2010 debate about proposals about how to fix the financial system, Warren said if a bill for \u201ca stronger consumer agency\u201d was not a possibility, she would choose \u201cno agency at all andplenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.\u201dOne year later, in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Warren said, \u201cAndI have thrown rocks at peoplethat I think are in the wrong.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019ve done it before, I\u2019ve continued to do it, and I\u2019m going to do it in the future.\u201dAdelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

Officers said the male victim had been on a moped when a pair of men on a second moped pulled up beside him.The men threw a \u201ccorrosive substance\u201d into his face, before stealing his moped and riding away. When officers responded, they found that the man had sustained facial injuries, but they are not\u00a0being treated as \u201clife threatening or life changing\u201d.The second attack took place 40 minutes later on Shoreditch High Street \u2014 a location just half a mile away. Once again, two men on a moped threw acid into the face of a man, who was taken to a hospital.Eight minutes after that, police received a third call after a man in his 20s had acid thrown in his face. The most serious of the attacks,\u00a0a crime scene was set up at the location and the man is reported to have received \u201clife-changing\u201d injuries.Another 19 minutes later police received a fourth call when another man on a moped had acid thrown in his face, with the attackers stealing his moped and again riding off.The final incident took place in Islington, North London, and took place another 12 minutes later when\u00a0a man was reported to have had a corrosive substance thrown in his face by two males on a moped.Police are appealing for eyewitnesses to the attacks.London is seeing a sudden surge in acid attacks, with the 261 attacks in 2015 jumping to 458 in 2016. There have been over 120 attacks in London so far this year, with the frequency of the attacks leading to the city being dubbed the acid attack capital.Acid appears to be finding favour with gangs and individuals to settle disputes and launch attacks, as simple bleach products and drain unblocker is available cheaply in shops without checks and carrying it does not incur penalties, like knives do.Home Office minister Sarah Newton told the BBC Friday that while the government was considering tighter restrictions on such materials, the fact they could be found in any kitchen cupboard made legislation difficult.Follow Oliver Lane onFacebook, Twitter:Follow @Oliver_Laneor e-mail: olane[at]breitbart.com\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAcid attacks are most common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The installation of a neural microchip would allow us to seamlessly integrate our capacity for creative thought with the raw silicon horsepower, granting us quite literally superhuman intellect.The idea is as ambitious as it is fraught with peril; concerns about the eventual obsolescence of a chip that would require actual brain surgery to replace, and the concept of privacy in a world where your memories exist on a hard drive top the list. Additionally, it means that any error in programming this interface would be fed directly into your brain, bringing an entirely new level of gravity to software bugs, let alone computer viruses.Neuralink registered as a medical research company in California in July 2016. Since then, it has gained at least 12 investors, six of which may benon-accredited. Musk has been deliberately obtuse regarding the specifics. When questioned, he responded as such:So, while Musk isn\u2019t feeling particularly helpful regarding Neuralink\u2019s financial outlook, he cannot evade the real question: will neural augmentation become humanity\u2019s deus ex machina, or will it simply leave mankinddivided?Follow\u00a0Nate\u00a0Church@Get2Churchon Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMusk is a parasitic maggot who sinks his teeth on taxpayer money wherever he can.

Brown signed SB54, the \u201cCalifornia Values Act\u201d into law last week making it illegal, after January 1, 2018, for a local law enforcement officer to ask about a person\u2019s immigration status during the course of routine interactions with the public, Breitbart News\u2019 Michelle Moons reported.\u00a0 The law also prohibits law enforcement officials from complying with ICE issued immigration detainers.\u201cThis bill does not prevent or prohibit Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Homeland Security from doing their own work in any way,\u201d Gov. Brown said after in the signing law and asigning statement.DHS officials responded quickly and said the will go right to work in California.\u201cUltimately, SB54 helps shield removable aliens from immigration enforcement and creates another magnet for more illegal immigration, all at the expense of the safety and security of the very people it purports to protect,\u201d Homan stated.SB54 will negatively impact ICE operations in California by nearly eliminating all cooperation and communication with our law enforcement partners in the state, voiding the delegated authority that the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office has under the 287g program, and prohibiting local law enforcement from contracting with the federal government to house detainees.\u201dDHS said the department and ICE remain committed\u00a0to its public safety mission. \u201cWe will continue to do our sworn duty to seek out dangerous criminal aliens and other immigration violators. ICE seeks straightforward cooperation with all sheriffs and local elected officials,\u201d Homan concluded. \u201cThis misguided legislation will severely undermine those efforts.\u201dBob Priceserves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Absolutely,\u201d Jones continued.\u201cThey were wrong to get rid of those Title IX Rules, you know,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were wrong to ban transgender [people] from the military. Just wrong, wrong, wrong.\u201dThe YouTubeclipis entitled \u201cDoug Jones commits political suicide in Alabama Senate race.\u201dWatch the full video here:According to the label on the clip, Jones was speaking on the sidelines of acampaign stophe made last Thursday at the Macedonia Baptist Church in Daphne, Alabama.In the clip, a woman asks Jones, \u201cI know that you are for equal rights for everyone. Mr. Jones, what about transgender people in schools and bathrooms?\u201dDean Young, a former candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, who is a longtime friend of Alabama Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore, released the clip at a press conference Monday.Speaking to Breitbart News, Young, who uploaded the clip to his YouTube channel, stated that the woman who asked the question in the video was sent to the Jones campaign stop by Young himself.Young used the occasion of the press conference to label Jones a \u201cflaming, left-wing liberal extremist.\u201dYoungexclaimed,\u00a0\u201cDoug Jones thinks it\u2019s okay for guys to pretend like they are girls and go into the little girls restrooms in schools. Doug Jones thinks it\u2019s okay for guys to pretend like they are girls and to go into girl\u2019s locker rooms and take showers with them from kindergarten to college. That won\u2019t work in Alabama.\u201d\u201cYou have a lot of good people in Alabama who believe in God and country. They won\u2019t stand for this. It won\u2019t work. \u2026 He needs to quit pretending he\u2019s a moderate. You need a sense of common decency in Alabama to win. Doug Jones is out in left field.\u201dWhile the video was clearly a political ambush attempt against Jones, it does spotlight the Democrat candidate\u2019s position on the controversial issue of transgender people pertaining to bathrooms and locker rooms.Jones\u2019s statement that \u201cthey were wrong to get rid of those Title IX Rules\u201d was a reference to the decision by the Trump administration\u2019s Departments of Justice and Education to rescind guidelines put into place by the Obama administration regarding\u00a0the treatment of transgender students and their rights to same-sex spaces in public schools, notably bathrooms and locker rooms.The Obama administration\u2019sguidelinesinterpreted Title IX rules\u00a0concerning transgender people. Title IX of the U.S. Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis of sex\u201d in any educational program that receives federal funding.The Obama administration\u2019s guidelines called for schools receiving federal funding to \u201ctreat a student\u2019s gender identity as the student\u2019s sex for purposes of Title IX and its implementing regulations. This means that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity.\u201dThe guidelines expressly call for federally funded schools to allow transgender people to use the bathrooms and locker rooms that are consistent with their \u201cgender identity.\u201dThe guidelines state:Restrooms and Locker Rooms. A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so. A school may, however, make individual-user options available to all students who voluntarily seek additional privacy.Besides rescinding those guidelines, in August, Trumpsigneda directive calling for the U.S. Armed Forces to cease proceeding with the recruitment of transgender people into the military. The order also bars the Department of Defense from providing medical treatment regimens for any transgender individuals currently serving in the military.Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

James Lankford (R-OK) said he would not support the Republican tax plan if it contributed to the deficit by a large margin.Partial\u00a0transcript as follows:TODD: One question on the tax bill. You yourself said you know there are going to be a lot more iterations of this that come out. I\u2019m curious, do you have a red line? You\u2019ve been a big deficit hawk in the past. If this increases the debt, is that something you\u2019re comfortable with supporting, even if the debt is increased, given that you have been a pretty tough critic of increasing the debt in the past?LANKFORD: I\u2019m actually not comfortable with increasing the debt. This has been a behind the scenes conversation for a long time. It\u2019s one thing to be able to cut taxes, it\u2019s another thing to say how are we going to deal with our debt and deficit? My main focus has been whatever economic growth model we put in place has to be reasonable to do it. If we cut taxes right now, we\u2019re expecting a .4 percent growth in the economy to be able to offset that. That\u2019s a pretty conservative estimate of economic growth. Our economy for the last ten years has not grown above 2 percent \u2014 above 3 percent a single year. We are stuck in a rut. We\u2019re going to have to bump the record player to get something going on the economy again.TODD: If this tax bill increases the debt too much, you\u2019re a no?LANKFORD: I am a no.

The question is, how are they going to relate that to their Christian faith?\u201cAnd if what I believe are the clear teachings of the gospel about love for all, the desire for justice and for making sure marginalised and defenceless people are protected, if it looks as though those teachings are being contradicted, then I think there is a need to say so.\u201d\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3681540150\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOpen all the gates to Buckingham palace.

The students, who call themselves\u00a0Ithaca High School\u2019s Students United Ithaca, penned aletterdemanding the production be recast or shut down after a white student was cast as Esmerelda.Esmerelda is accurately depicted in the Disney musical, and is written for, a young woman of color. Esmerelda is a Roma, part of an oppressed class of people. It is her oppression, and that of her people, which allows her to better understand the perspective of the Hunchback and to ultimately advocate for him.The students continued, complaining that the student who had been cast had \u201chazel eyes\u201d and blonde hair.\u201d \u201cThe young woman who was cast in this role has hazel eyes, blonde hair, and is the epitome of whiteness. This is an unfair position to put her in. At best, this is cultural appropriation. At worst, it is whitewashing, a racist casting practice which has its roots in minstrelsy,\u201d they wrote. The students then explicitly\u00a0demanded the show be shut down.We respectfully ask them to either:1. Choose a different show and hold new auditions.2. Do the Hunchback of Notre Dame, but recruit the many talented brown and black female students at IHS who have received the message that IHS musicals are a playground of the white privileged students of our school. We ask that these students are actively recruited and encouraged to audition. There are students who have never stepped foot in the choir room but can blow the roof off their church choir. They should be playing this role. It is their story to tell.The Ithaca City School District announced last week that theHunchbackproduction would be shut down. \u201cThe active community engagement and conversation about the selection of the Hunchback of Notre Dame for the Ithaca High School musical has led to many conversations in our school district. This dialogue has affirmed our observations and wishes to have a more inclusive and culturally responsive learning community. In short, our efforts to eliminate institutional biases are ongoing,\u201d thestatementread. \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame will not be performed this spring.\u201dA mother of one of the student\u2019s that fought for the play\u2019s cancellation defended the decision to take the play away from those students who had already been cast. \u201cHowever, the loss experienced by the Hunchback cast must be considered in a broader context. While these students may be experiencing a loss this year, students of color experience loss throughout their whole education. The consequences of that loss will persist throughout their lives,\u201d shewrote.Although it shouldn\u2019t matter, the source material forHunchback, Victor Hugo\u2019s 1831 novelThe Hunchback of Notre Dame, does not\u00a0specify Esmerelda\u2019s race. \u201cEsmeralda in the book is not 100% Romani (Gypsy). Her mother is a French women\u00a0(sic) and while her Father could have been a Gypsy, it is never actually mentioned who was her father,\u201d one blog about the novel wrote in a 2011post.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3744807034\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAbsolutely they are!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

One of the filtered tweets, from Trump Jr., was critical of Twitter\u2019s uneven enforcement of its terms of service.Two tweets from the President, made today, and one from Trump Jr., posted on March 4, are currently hidden behind content filters. Users navigating to their profile pages with their content filters on will not be able to see the tweets.Only when users manually disable their content filter via settings are they able to see the tweets, which appear to be completely innocuous and not in violation of any of Twitter\u2019s terms of service. All three of the filtered tweets include links to stories on the Drudge Report.Ironically, the tweet from Donald Trump Jr. that was hidden by Twitter contained criticism of the company\u2019s uneven enforcement of their terms of service.The filtering appears to have been triggered by the retweeting of@DRUDGE_REPORT. Users navigating to the account\u2019s page, which automatically posts links from the website of the Drudge Report, will find that all tweets from the account are hidden behind the same \u201csensitive content\u201d warning message.Users who wish to ensure that they continue to see all tweets from the President, Donald Trump Jr. and @DRUDGE_REPORT will have to manually disable their content filter.

At $259.30 per share, it is trading at the lowest price since early 2017.The company is producing 90 percent fewer Model 3 vehicles than forecast; its Chief Financial Officerresignedover fears the company is burning $2 billion of cash per year; and Tesla is now the subject of a federal probe over a death that occurred while a driver was using the car\u2019s self-driving features.All of that contributed to Moody\u2019s Investors Service issuing acredit downgradefor Tesla, from B2 (non-investment grade) to B3 (highly speculative). Moody\u2019s analysts commented that the company\u2019s \u201csignificant shortfall in the production rate of the company\u2019s Model 3 electric vehicle\u201d had led to \u201cliquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds.\u201dAfter trading closed on March 29, the Associated Pressreportedthat Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA-NASDAQ) was recalling 123,000 cars, or almost half of the 276,000 vehicles the company has ever produced, to fix rusting bolts that hold its steering column.Tesla\u2019s website stated that bolts could corrode in winter conditions on all cars built before April 2016. The companystatedthat the chance of failure is just 0.02 percent, and blamed the issue on salt used on icy winter roads. Tesla claims, \u201cIf the bolts fail, the driver is still able to steer the car, but increased force is required due to loss or reduction of power assist.\u201dCEO Elon Musk gave a speech last weekend that many are calling is his equivalent of Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s rallying of British boat owners to save the troops at Dunkirk. He\u00a0showed up at Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, factory to encourage workers to disprove the \u201chaters\u201d that are shorting the company\u2019s stock on the bet that Tesla cannot ramp up manufacturing by 1,000 percent to mass-produce on its Model 3.Tesla Chief Engineer Doug Fieldtoldworkers in a March 23 memo, \u201cI find that personally insulting, and you should too\u201d that Wall Street hedge funds think we will fail. \u201cLet\u2019s make them regret ever betting against us. You will prove a bunch of haters wrong.\u201dTesla will celebrate the two-year anniversary of introducing its Model 3 \u2014 and quickly taking deposits for 500,000 potential customers \u2014 on Saturday. CEO Musk emphasized at the time that through \u201cphysics-first principles,\u201d Tesla would shape a new mode of industrial production to improve efficiency by \u201cfactors of 10 or even 100 times.\u201d Musk emphasized that Tesla\u2019s key advantage in building all-electric vehicles would be limitingmoving electric engine partsto 20, versus up to 10,000 for internal combustion engines.Musk claimed that the company would be delivering 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week in the last quarter of 2017 and 10,000 per week in the first quarter of 2018. But Doug Field stated in his weekend memo to Tesla workers that the company is currently producing about 1,000 cars per week, and that Tesla\u2019s goal is to produce 1,500 a week by the end of the second quarter.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMusk is a con artist who's happily taken taxpayer subsidies.

Orrin Hatch (R-UT), he and 12 other Republican Senators have taken the extreme, open borders position that the Trump administration should release every illegal alien who crosses the southern border with a child into the interior of the U.S.The plan would spur a completely open border until the Republican-controlled Congress passes legislation that allows children to be detained with the border-crossing adults that they arrived in the U.S. with.\u201cWe, therefore, ask you to halt implementation of the Department\u2019s zero tolerance policy while Congress works out a solution that enables faster processing of individuals who enter our country illegally without requiring the forced, inhumane separation of children from their parents,\u201d the letter signed by the 13 Republican Senators states. \u201cWe believe a reasonable path forward can be found that accommodates the need to enforce our laws while holding true to other, equally essential values.\u201dHere, Breitbart News has compiled a list of all the Republican Senators supporting this plan to stop all border enforcement:Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT)Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS)Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN)Sen. John Boozman (R-AR)Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV)Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO)Sen. James Lankford (R-OK)Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA)Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH)Pushing back against the Republican establishment and Democrats\u2019 efforts to end all border enforcement is Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who most recently slammed a plan that would allow all illegal aliens crossing the border with children to be released into the U.S.\u201cDems\u2019 Keep Families Together Act is better called the Child Trafficking Encouragement Act,\u201d Cotton said, asBreitbart Newsreported. \u201cShow up at border with a minor & call him your child, then you get released into the US! Children will be abducted & sold to drug cartels & slave-traders as a free ticket into US.\u201dPresident Trump has asked the Republican-controlled Congress to enact his plan, which would allow border-crossing children to be detained with their guardians and parents for extended periods of time. This plan would speed up the asylum and immigration hearing process, and allow the family unit to be deported together back to their native country.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

I want it to be me,\u201d McCarthy told Turning Point USA\u2019s High School Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C., as reported by theWashington Examiner.McCarthy is currently second-in-command in the Republican caucus in the House. His position is traditionally a stepping stone to the Speaker\u2019s job, and current Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) recently announced his retirement from Congress at the end of the term.However, there may be other candidates.

However, hewithdrewhis name from consideration after conservativescomplainedhe was too moderate.

But the paper explains that the decades-old trees are being destroyed to make room for a track field that is being displaced by the impending construction of the Obama Center. One did not need to transpire without the other, so the moving of the track field is inextricably tied to the Obama Center, critics note.The paper also points out that the Obama Center is impacting far and away more acreage and city facilities than just the area upon which the complex will eventually sit.TheTimeswrote:Since former President Barack Obama picked Jackson Park for his center in August 2016, a series of intertwined projects in and around Jackson Park has made the impact much larger than just the 19.3 acres to be occupied by the center, including retooling roadways and relocating athletic fields.Despite claims by Obama representatives, the famed Jackson Park, designed by landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in 1893, will see major alterations even though the park was placed on the federal National Register of Historic Places in 1972. And preservationists say the Obama Center is destroying the carefully planned parklands across the city\u2019s Lake Shore region.The claim that the Center will not force the city, state, or federal governments to spend tax dollars on the complex is also coming up false.According to theWall Street Journal, taxpayers are now being asked for nearly two hundred million dollars for costs resulting from the Obama Center.\u201cNow comes news that Illinois taxpayers will put up at least $174 million for roadway and transit reconfigurations needed to accommodate the Obama Center. If you don\u2019t live in Illinois, you may be smirking \u2014 but you\u2019ll be footing the bill, too,\u201d theJournalreportedon August 10. \u201cEighty percent of such spending is generally reimbursed by the federal government, and Illinois officials confirmed to me that they expect to receive $139 million from Washington if they request it.\u201dFormer Obama chief of staff and current embattled Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel thinks the $174 million in tax dollars to be spent on the center is \u201cmoney well spent.\u201dOddly, the city will not even enjoy rent money from the sprawling Obama Center because another sweetheart deal the city agreed to when it entered into the pact with the Obama Foundation maintains that the Centerwill payonly one dollar for the land.

Jeff Sessions, according to aWashington Postpoll.In contrast, 42 percent of likely\u00a0voters, and 27 percent of Republicans, strongly back Sessions\u2019\u00a0continued role as AG.The poll was taken amid reports that Trump wants to fire Sessions for not heading off the establishment-backed and\u00a0unprecedented investigation into Trump\u2019s pre-election\u00a0businesses and his campaign.Sessions has been Trump\u2019s longest-standing supporter in Washington D.C., but Democrats are hoping the investigation will impeach and ruin Trump.The poll is skewed by Democrats\u2019 unusual support for Sessions, who is often smeared as a Civil War-style racist by progressives, despite Sessions\u2019\u00a0courtroom destruction of the KKK in his home state.\u00a0Overall, 75 percent of Democrats oppose Sessions\u2019 firing, while just 14 percent support Sessions\u2019 removal.Forty-seven percent of Republicans want to keep Sessions, compared to 31 percent who want him removed.GOP support for Sessions is bolstered by his effective and\u00a0aggressive\u00a0implementation of the President\u2019s \u201cHire American policy.\u201d For example, Sessions\u2019 staff recently arrested an Indian CEO for labor-tracking white-collar workers.He is also using\u00a0his power\u00a0as AG to overhaul the nation\u2019s\u00a0border-security policies to block illegal migrants, despite bipartisan efforts to preserve the inflow of cheap labor.Sessions has a lot of support among GOP Senators but he\u00a0faces sniping\u00a0from amnesty proponents, such as South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham. If Sessions stays on as AG< he is likely to block from Graham\u2019s plan to push an establishment agenda through the Senate\u2019s judiciary\u00a0committee in 2019.Lopsided Democratic support for Sessions and hatred for Trump also leaves Sessions with an apparently higher voter approval rating. In reality, nearly Democrats would also like to see Sessions gone because of his role in helping achieve Trump\u2019s shocking win in 2016.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMore fake polls that's been reported as fake news!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

Your thoughts on USMCA?HARPER:I was of somewhat of a different view. I thought the president\u2019s priority from the outset should be Chinese trade. I thought NAFTA\u2019s pretty good overall.Although I\u2019m not going to dispute, I think the president got a pretty good deal for the United States. But what I think is interesting in this from a Canadian perspective is that it provides a number of incentives for Canada and Mexico to work with the United States on the Chinese trade imbalance. That to me should have been the real objective all along.We all have massive and growing trade imbalances with China. I think this is a serious problem for our workers. It\u2019s not due merely to normal economic factors. It\u2019s due to the fact that Chinese market\u00a0is largely\u00a0closed, and I would like to see our government take advantage of these incentives in this deal to work with the United States to open up that part.BARTIROMO:In terms of this new trade deal, I guess it does benefit American workers because more of autos are going to be originated in the United States, what\u2019s most important from this trade deal from your standpoint?HARPER:I think from the\u00a0standpoint of the United States, the gains from the auto sectors. There are both content requirements and wage provisions, a number of other things that really should over time tilt new production back to the United States.I\u2019ve always felt this was the only real grievance that I thought was legitimate of Mexico. Canada and the United States, we built up the auto sector during the global financial crisis and the next thing we do is see them moving product to Mexico. I think that was a legitimate\u00a0thing for the president to be concerned about, and I think this helps tilt that back.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4137756710\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHow many decades did Canada ride on the backs of the working class Americans when they operated under Nafta?

According to areportfrom The College Fix, the unnamed female admitted to performing oral sex on Rossley Jr. without his consent. Despite this, Drake University never investigated that portion of the incident. He was ultimately expelled from the university.Rossley Jr., who has ADHD, dyslexia, and \u201cword-retrieval issues,\u201d requested assistance at the hearing that took place after the investigation. However, Rossley Jr. was not provided with assistance and made to fend for himself during a nine-hour hearing.Rossley Jr.\u2019s father, Tom, was fired from his position on the Drake University Board of Trustees after he argued that his son was being treated unfairly. Rossley Sr. then sued, alleging \u201cTitle IX retaliation.\u201d A judge threw out the lawsuit over the summer, arguing that Rossley\u2019s position on the board was not covered under Title IX.The Rossleys argue that several parts of the proceedings were biased against him because of his gender. Rossley Jr. claims that university officials told him that it would be seen as \u201cretaliatory\u201d if he filed a complaint against his accuser. The implication is that officials told Rossley Jr. that the only reason he might file a complaint would be if he committed an assault and was looking to cover it up.Last week, the court decided that the portion of the case that focuses on Drake\u2019s failure to investigate the accusations made against the unnamed female can proceed to a new trial.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4152735534\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat's about the size of it.

Part of that amnesty, multiple Democrats said, would include allowing DACA illegal aliens to eventually obtain American citizenship.\u201cWe would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image. Free DREAMers forever from any fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country,\u201d Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) said.Rep. Julian Castro (D-TX) said that his amnesty plan for illegal aliens would make all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens eligible for eventually obtaining American citizenship.\u201cIn my first 100 days \u2026 immigration reform that will honor asylum claims, that would put undocumented immigrants \u2014 as long as they haven\u2019t committed a serious crime \u2014 on a pathway to citizenship,\u201d Castro said.Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) vowed that not only would he grant amnesty to DACA illegal aliens and the hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals in the U.S. on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but he would end interior enforcement of immigration, allowing illegal aliens to remain and work freely once they cross into the country.Booker said:On day one, I will make sure that number one we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border [Protection] policies that are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border. [Emphasis added]Number two, I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipientsand to make sure that people who are here for Temporary Protected Status can stay and remain here. [Emphasis added]Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) touted his giving American taxpayer-funded financial aid to illegal aliens in Washington state and called DACA illegal aliens \u201csome of the most inspirational people\u201d in the country.\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a person who has not only talked about DREAMers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams,\u201d Inslee said.A DACA amnesty would put more citizen children of illegal aliens \u2014 known as \u201canchor babies\u201d \u2014 on federal welfare, asBreitbart Newsreported, while\u00a0American taxpayers would be left potentially with a$26 billionbill.Additionally, aboutone in fiveDACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at leastone in sevenwould go on Medicaid.Any plan to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens that does not also include provisions to halve legal immigration levels \u2014 the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants a year at the expense of America\u2019s working and middle class \u2014 would give amnestied illegal aliens the opportunity to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.At the southern border, a DACA amnesty has the potential to trigger a border surge that could triple the number of illegal aliens pouring through the border. Since DACA\u2019s inception, more than 2,100 recipients of the program have been kicked off because they were found to either be criminals or gang members.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

It aims to attract musicians who were either from or live in those specific states, and it has one messaging goal: Vote for anyone but President Trump.46for46.orgThe campaign, paid for by\u00a0bpoliticalPAC, has alreadyattractedartists such as Nathaniel Rateliff, Lissie, Bon Iver, Dashboard Confessional, Sylvan Esso, and Patty Griffin. The campaign is the brainchild of \u201clongtime artist managers\u201d Kyle Frenette\u00a0and\u00a0Christopher Moon, who decided to use their connections to attempt to defeat Trump in 2020.According toBillboard:The minds behind the campaign are\u00a0Kyle Frenette\u00a0and\u00a0Christopher Moon, longtime artist managers who felt compelled to use their considerable rolodexes in service of the Democratic campaign for president. For Frenette \u2014\u00a0who owns the artist management firm Middle West and represented\u00a0Bon Iver\u00a0and its frontman\u00a0Justin Vernon\u00a0between 2007 and 2018\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the project is part of a larger pivot toward politics that began in February 2018, when he\u00a0announced his bid\u00a0to represent Wisconsin\u2019s 7th district in Congress. Frenette had never held or run for political office before,\u00a0making his headlong leap into the political fray nothing if not a bold move. But as with so many others,\u00a0Trump\u2019s shocking win in 2016 had shattered the sense of complacency he had built up over the previous eight years.\u201cI voted for [Obama], he was elected, he seemed like a very good leader, and I thought everything would be taken care of,\u201d Frenette tellsBillboard. \u201cIt almost seems like that was this country\u2019s M.O.\u00a0in a way. Meanwhile, you\u2019ve got the GOP sweeping in on the state level and putting all of these things in place and taking advantage of the political divide.\u201dFrenette worked on a Rock the Vote campaign during the 2018 midterms and organized a concert rally for Sen.\u00a0Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). It inspired him to move his efforts to a larger scale.\u201cThe concert sold out and we raised the most money in a single evening [of Tammy\u2019s]\u00a0entire political career,\u201d Frenette said, according toBillboard. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t even try. It was astounding.\u201dThe \u201c46 for 46\u201d events hope to feature activist speakers, politicians, and candidates, although organizers want to ensure that they provide enough \u201cdiversity.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a white guy, my partner\u2019s a white guy,\u201d Frenette said. \u201cWe need to diversify here.\u201d\u201cHonestly, we\u2019ve got 46 concerts to put on, and so we\u2019re not gonna pick and choose,\u201d he added. \u201cIf a prominent artist from California would really like to play California, then great, that\u2019s awesome. \u2026 We\u2019re not gonna be picky, so long as we hit those crucial swing states.\u201dThe campaign goes beyond the concerts, with organizers planning to ask attendees to \u201cPledge 46,\u201d which means \u201cchatting with 46 people in their social circle about the Democratic nominee, donating money\u00a0to the party or the candidate\u2019s campaign ($4, $6 or $46 are the suggested amounts), or volunteering 46 hours of their time to canvassing, phone banking and other get out the vote efforts,\u201d according toBillboard.\u201cThe pledge additionally includes a commitment to keep working for progressive Democratic candidates up and down the ballot in future elections,\u201dBillboardadded.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4555136085\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nPhonies with gigantic egos?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

The employee wrote in the memo:Over the last 5 years I\u2019ve heard co-workers spew hateful words about immigrants, boast unabashedly about gentrifying neighborhoods, mockingly imitate people who speak different languages, reject candidates of color without evidence because of \u2018fit\u2019 and so much more. So, just as I\u2019m doing with this essay, I ultimately resolved to break my silence. And though I eventually grew more comfortable using challenging moments to educate my co-workers, I never stopped feeling the burden of being black at Google. And the more insensitive comments weighed on me, the less safe I felt here\u2014and the less capable I was of being my best self at work, or myself at all.The author of the memo reportedly worked at the firm for several years and confirmed to Motherboard that he wrote it but did not comment on it. The former employee cites moments in the memo where he felt uncomfortable at Google, such as following the shootings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and during the protests following the shootings. The memo states:I realized that my team simply did not have much to say on the issue of police brutality. This was odd\u2014mostly because I\u2019d watched them debate countless other topics, newsworthy and not, with a proud deftness and alacrity. From disappearing Malaysian airplanes to the spread of Ebola to the marriages and divorces of celebrities I\u2019d never heard of, my teammates always had something to say about everything. But when it came to the violent policing of black bodies, they were silent.This memo is one of many published by current and former employees in recent months, which appears to imply that employees at the firm are unhappy for a number of reasons. Just last week, another Google employee alleged widespread discrimination against pregnant employees at the firm. Amemotitled\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m Not Returning to Google After Maternity Leave, and Here is Why,\u201d was posted to an internal company messaging board for expecting mothers. The memo was then reposted to other message boards and quickly went viral within the company. In the memo, the female employee writes:I\u2019m sharing this statement because I hope it informs needed change in how Google handles discrimination, harassment and retaliation. This is a long read, but the details are important in understanding the often drawn-out, isolating and painful experience of victims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Also, if anything similar has happened to you, know that you\u2019re not alone.In response to the memo, one employee wrote: \u201cWOW. I can\u2019t wait till absolutely nothing changes as a result. She deserves better than this continued train-wreck.\u201d In the 2,300 word memo, the employee alleges that her manager made discriminatory remarks about pregnant women, and when reported to HR she received retaliation.

Amy Klobucharwas askedabout meat, she warned of obesity in the country, saying that she continued to support putting calorie counts on menus in restaurants.\u201cWe have to make sure we look at science and we make sure we do everything that\u2019s healthy, not just for individual Americans but also for our environment,\u201d she said.When asked if she would support changing dietary guidelines to reduce meat consumptions, she replied, \u201cOh, I think you can look at doing that of course.\u201dSen. Kamala Harrissaidthe government should create incentives to encourage Americans to eat healthier and educate them of the environmental impact of the food that they ate.Harris said she would support changing the government dietary guidelines and the food pyramid to reduce the amount of red meat in American diets.She also supported the idea of putting climate impact labels on food.\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that we should, you know, expand what\u2019s on those cans of those things you buy in the grocery store,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should expand the list. And included in that should be a measure of the impact on the environment.\u201dMayor Pete Buttigiegcalledfor more \u201cbalance\u201d in American meat production but was careful to say he was not in favor of abolishing the cow.He argued that government intervention like a carbon tax would encourage Americans have \u201cmore balanced diet\u201d and a \u201cmore balanced footprint.\u201d\u201cInstead we change the economic signals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe bring it into balance and balance is what we have lost when it comes to our relationship with creation, with the earth that sustains our ability to live.\u201dO\u2019Rourkeciteda similar solution, arguing that a carbon tax would balance out the carbon emissions by the meat industry.\u201cI think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the markets to respond by setting a price on carbon in every single part of our economy, every facet of American life,\u201d he said.Sen. Cory Bookerconfirmedhe was a vegan, but dodged the question about whether he would ask the government to intervene in American diets to reduce meat consumption. Instead, he proposed that the government stop subsidizing unhealthy foods.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about healthy food systems and the toxins that are in our food,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I will always be about the freedom to eat what you want, but we are going to have to make sure our government is not subsidizing the things that make us sick and unhealthy and hurt our environment.\u201dTop tier candidates Joe Biden, Sen.

And so he hasn\u2019t and, instead, he\u2019s done this. And that, I think, has something to be considered before you rescind a policy.\u201cRight,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco said.\u201cNot just say I\u2019ll give you six months to do it,\u201d Sotomayer said, referring to Trump\u2019s past announcement that he would hold off on rescinding DACA for six months to allow Congress to come up with a legislative solution.\u201cAnd where is the political decision made clearly?\u201d Sotomayor said referring to the June 22, 2018 memorandum issued by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to explain why the department was rescinding DACA.\u201cThat this is not about the law; this is about our choice to destroy lives,\u201d Sotomayor said, directly expressing what she believed a ruling to end DACA would mean to those enrolled in it.The back and forth between the justices, Francisco and two attorneys who argued for DACA petitioners \u2014 attorney Ted Olson and Michael Mongan, Solicitor General at California Department of Justice \u2013 included more discussion about the impact the ruling would have on both DACA recipients and the future enforcement of federal immigration law.Olson and Mongan argued that the Trump administration did not provide a compelling reason for rescinding DACA, which came to the high court after differing results in lower court decisions on the matter.Francisco argued that DACA, put in place by President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action in 2012, was not legal or highly likely to be illegal and it also would \u201chamstring\u201d federal law enforcement from enforcing immigration law.But the heart of the case revolves around two issues: Can the courts review the government\u2019s rescission of the DACA program? And was the government\u2019s decision to rescind DACA \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which sets standards for federal agency actions that are generally enforceable in the courts?The case analysis by Steven D. Schwinn of the University of Illinois Chicago John Marshall School of law noted that \u201cAs of 2017, when the government rescinded the program, there were nearly 700,00 active DACA recipients. Their average age was just under 24-years-old. Over 90 percent were employed and 45 percent were in school.\u201dMany of the groups submitting Amicus briefs in favor of DACA in perpetuity \u2014 or forever \u2014 were educational institutions and U.S. businesses who benefit from this demographic.The entities backing DHS were those groups that believe DACA is not constitutional and benefits those in the country illegally while threatening the employment and educational opportunities of citizens.A ruling in the case is expected in June 2020.These cases areDepartment of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, No. 18-587, Trump v. NAACP, No. 18-588, and McAleenan v.

The escapade led to thedeath\u00a0of three migrants, one of whom was a pregnant woman.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has largelyblamedincreased illegal migrant activity on pro-migrant NGOs affiliated with left-wing Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros.\u201cOne would have to be blind not to see that migration in the Balkans is organized by the Soros Network. This isde factomigration consultancy,\u201d OrbantoldHungarian media followingattempted border crossingslast month.\u201cThe Soros network is reaching the point where it wants to transform Europe into a mixed culture continent, possibly by eliminating nation-states.\u00a0They will continue to push for this plan and will use all their tools,\u201d Orbansaidin December.Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at@TomlinsonCJor email at\u00a0ctomlinson(at)breitbart.com\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4789949542\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSweden, Germany and France will still let them in and allow them refugee\nstatus.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

Wealthier? Win more awards, if she were a guy?No, she wants the right to be a bigger jerk than she already is.Here are some of the lyrics\u2026What\u2019s it like to brag about raking in dollarsAnd getting bitches and models?And it\u2019s all good if you\u2019re badAnd it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re madIf I was out flashing my dollarsI\u2019d be a bitch, not a ballerThey\u2019d paint me out to be badSo, it\u2019s okay that I\u2019m madI\u2019m so sick of running as fast as I canWondering if I\u2019d get there quicker if I was a manAnd I\u2019m so sick of them coming at me again\u2018Cause if I was a manThen I\u2019d be the manYou\u2019ve come a long way, baby\u2026Inthe video\u2014 an exercise in puddle-deep wokeness seeking peanut gallery cheers over meaning \u2014 our poor, put upon, oppressed, powerless princess Taylor (whowroteanddirectedandstars)becomesTyler, a bro-type who \u2014 gasp! \u2014 appears to work hard, play hard, enjoy money and beautiful women\u2026 But he is also a man-spreader on the subway \u2014 which remains one of history\u2019s great, all-time, anti-science, female whines.Dear Ladies: We\u2019re not spreading out due to a sense of entitlement. It\u2019s called anatomy. Believe it or not, we\u2019re built a little different than you and we don\u2019t want to crush The Boys. It hurts. Fer real.But if you look at the video, if you look at her message, Taylor Swift is pouting because she believes that if she were a guy, she could be more obnoxious than she already is.The message here is quite revealing. Swift is not searching for a path to something mature and noble, for something that matters, something good that would be more available to her if she were a guy. No, she\u2019s angry that guys get to be bigger jerks than she does, that guys are allowed to be dicks and have temper tantrums. Swift is saying,No fair! I wanna be a guy so I can be more obnoxious, loud, inconsiderate, spoiled, and self-centered!!Taylor Swift should thank her lucky stars she\u2019s a gal. A guy could never become a superstar whining about ex-girlfriends; he\u2019d be laughed off the planet. A guy could also never get away with a lazy video like \u201cThe Man.\u201d Good grief, if he were to attack the female gender with a bunch of stereotypes, he\u2019d be blacklisted and canceled before the day was out.But our poor, little rich girl will only be met with SLAYYYY KWEEEEENNNN, thanks to the female privilege that helped to make her who she is \u2014 which is someone increasingly insulated, humorless, and insufferable.Don\u2019t worry, Taylor\u2026 Men will still fight all the wars and do all the dirty and dangerous jobs that keep your velvet world safe, clean, and air conditioned\u2026 You know, that part of \u201cequality\u201d you entitled she-babies want no part of.

The dire state of the socialist country\u2019s \u201cuniversal healthcare system\u201d has raised serious concern among health experts that this pandemic could wipe out an excessively high number of people.One of those most concerned appears to Maduro himself, who in a strange moment of vulnerability appeared to admit that the virus could wreak unprecedented chaos and heartbreak on a country that is already experiencing one of the world\u2019s most severe economic, humanitarian, and migratory crises.\u201cAt five in the morning, we will enter social quarantine,\u201d Maduro said in a televised address on Sunday evening. \u201cThere is no other option \u2026 We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country.\u201dExceptions to quarantine will allow for the passage\u00a0of transport, health, and food delivery services, he added.Security forces were deployed around the country toimposetravel restrictions as well as support sanitization efforts in areas\u00a0deemed a contagion risk.Venezuelan hospitals have for years experienced chronic shortages of medical resources such as antibiotics and basic sanitary products required to confront an epidemic. Such a crisis in healthcare has existed for years, with the leading national newspaperEl Nacionalin 2017dubbingthe situation a \u201cHealth Holocaust.\u201d\u201cMost hospitals don\u2019t have water, face masks or even soap,\u201d Dr. Patricia Valenzuela, board member of the Venezuelan Society of Infectology,toldthe AP last week. \u201cWe\u2019re not prepared.\u201dOne of Maduro\u2019s strategies for dealing with the virus is to step up the importation of Cuban doctors as part of an agreement first drawn up between late dictators Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Fidel Castro, where medical specialists are sent abroad toperformslave labor for the communist regime.Cuba has built an unwarranted reputation for high standards of health care, despite the fact it has some of the worst health outcomes in the world and activelymanipulateshealth statistics like infant mortality.\u00a0On Sunday, Venezuelan state media outlet VTVreportedthat a delegation of Cuban specialists had arrived in Caracas to help Venezuela deal with the outbreak.\u00a0Last week, Maduro falsely claimed that Cuba had found a cure for the virus.\u201cCuba is at the head, at the vanguard \u2014 Cuba, always Cuba, is at the vanguard, with interferon, a medicine created with Cuban medical technology,\u201d hesaidat\u00a0an event commemorating the National Day of the Doctors and Doctors of the Homeland. \u201cThis\u00a0is a medicine created in Cuba that has had excellent results in its application in the coronavirus crisis in China.\u201dFollow Ben Kew onFacebook, Twitter at@ben_kew,\u00a0or\u00a0email him at bkew@breitbart.com.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"....We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country.\u201d No virus can bring down Venezuela...that's already been done\nby Mauro a long time ago.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) ispromotinglegislation that would change voting methods for November\u2019s election, including a nationwide vote-by-mail option.Wisconsin\u2019s election is underway despite its statewide stay-at-home order and an executive order issue by Gov. Tony Evers (D) that effectively moved in-person voting to June 9. His order was immediately challenged and overturned by Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, prompting a response from Klobuchar.\u201cThis is why I lead the bill so voters are not disenfranchised in November,\u201d the former presidential hopeful said:KlobucharannouncedThe Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020 (NDEBA) last month alongside Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), which would expand early in-person voting and extend \u201cno-excuse absentee vote-by-mail\u201d to all states.The bill would specifically \u201censure that voters in all states have 20 days of early in-person voting and no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail and ensure states begin processing votes cast during early voting or by mail 14 days before Election Day to avoid delays in counting votes on Election Day,\u201d per the release.\u201cAmericans are facing unprecedented disruptions to their daily lives and we need to make sure that in the midst of this pandemic, Americans don\u2019t also lose their ability to vote,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement, attributing the introduction of the bill to the confusion associated with Ohio\u2019s primary, which officials ultimately postponed.She continued:The confusion regarding Ohio\u2019s primary only underscores the need for federal legislation. Some states have announced that they will postpone their primary elections, and many election officials have expressed concern regarding how this public health emergency will affect upcoming elections. We must take critical steps to ensure that states have the resources they need to implement early in-person voting and no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail programs. As Congress prepares to provide states with medical and economic relief, we should also act swiftly to pass my legislation to ensure that every American has a safe way to participate in our democracy during a national emergency.The release touts the NDEBA as a \u201ccommonsense solution\u201d not just for 2020 but \u201cfuture elections,\u201d adding to the mounting suspicions of the GOP, whichbelievesDemocrats are trying to use the national crisis to advance their broader agenda of changing voting laws and methods, whether through the next coronavirus relief bill or separate legislation.\u201cOur Democratic friends want the federal government to take over elections, but historically those have been handled at the state level,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX)said, according toPolitico.\u201cStates should run state\u2019s elections,\u201d Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) stated. \u201cWashington D.C. should not run the state\u2019s elections. So if a state determines that\u2019s the way it wants to go, a state should make that decision.\u201dKlobuchar\u2019s push comes as the GOP gears up for what could be a contentious battle over the next relief bill, as several Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), haveindicatedthat they intend to fight for vote-by-mail in the next phase of relief.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nVoting by mail has always been the Democrats' wet dream.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

Flynn was then-President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser.Among the 39 Obama officials who submitted unmasking requests for Flynn\u2019s identity are former Vice President Joe Biden, former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI Director James Comey, former U.N., former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power.Grenell\u2019s list identified 53 requests made by Obama administration officials to reveal Flynn\u2019s identity on intelligence reports.Unmasking requests themselves are not classified, explained Fleitz, who worked for\u00a025 years in various national security positions at the CIA, DIA, the Department of State, and the House Intelligence Committee staff.\u201cI don\u2019t know why these names weren\u2019t public in the first place, but the fact that someone made one of these requests is not classified, and I think that should have been released straight away,\u201d said Fleitz on Thursday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019sBreitbart News Dailywith host Alex Marlow.Fleitz added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why this is so hard to get out, and I think that the [Trump] administration has to just release all of the names of requesters who asked for Trump campaign officials after the election.In terms of transparency and reassuring the American public that intelligence isn\u2019t being abused, that has to be revealed.\u201dFleitz called for greater congressional oversight of the intelligence agencies.LISTEN:Democrats and the broader left are misrepresenting the regularity of unmasking, explained Fleitz, noting that the identities of U.S. persons captured via intelligence agency surveillance operations are concealed on corresponding intelligence reports via redaction.\u201cIf you listen to the Democrats and to defenders of the Obama administration, obtaining the name that had been redacted from an NSA report is routine [and] done all the time,\u201d Fleitz said.MSNBC\u2019s Brian Williams invited former CIA DirectorJohn Brennan, now an MSNBC \u201canalyst,\u201d to describe the Obama administration\u2019s unmasking of American citizens\u2019 identities as unworthy of public attention:Fleitz described unmaskings as a rare event during his tenure at the CIA. \u201cI was a CIA officer for 19 years,\u201d he stated. \u201cFor the first 16, I didn\u2019t even know you could do this. This was such a sensitive thing. When an intelligence agency \u2014 the CIA or NSA or another agency \u2014 collects foreign intelligence, they\u2019re not allowed to collect against Americans unless it\u2019s a very special circumstance. If an American is swept up in an intelligence report, it\u2019s blacked out.\u201d\u201c[Such redactions] are called \u2018minimized,\u2019 and to deminimize it, or to unmask [the U.S. person\u2019s identify], a special request has been made to the national security agency [that] collected it. The person who makes the request has to be fairly senior and has to put the request in writing.\u201dFleitz added, \u201c[Unmasking] is treated very seriously. It\u2019s not that easy to do it. It is not routine. By contrast, when I was at [the State Department] from 2001 to 2005, Deputy Secretary [Richard] Armitage made 100 requests the whole time he was there. We know that U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power made 260 requests, and I think they were all in\u00a0 2016, and a lot of them were in late 2016.\u201d\u201cI worked for Ambassador [John] Bolton for four years,\u201d Fleitz recalled. \u201cHe made ten requests. There were so many requests at the end of [the Obama] administration.\u201dFleitz emphasized that the 53 above-mentioned unmasking requests only pertained to Flynn.\u201c[Richard] Grenell or someone else needs to give us information on how many other requests were made [by Obama administration officials] about other Trump campaign officials, and I think there\u2019s going to be quite a few of them,\u201dconcluded Fleitz.National Security Agency (NSA) officers and officials should have denied Obama officials\u2019 requests to reveal the identities of Flynn and other U.S. persons, Fleitz stated.Fleitz remarked, \u201cIt was up to officers of NSA and NSA officials to say no to these requests, to say, \u2018Look, you are asking for the names of someone in the incoming administration. That constitutes spying, one administration spying on an incoming administration.\u201d\u201cNSA should not have been part of that,\u201d Fleitz added, speculating on partisan and political corruption of intelligence agencies. \u201cWhere were the IG complaints that intelligence was being weaponized against an incoming administration? Why are IG complaints always lodged against Republicans or Republican administrations?\u201dFleitz concluded, \u201cThis was an opportunity for people who stand for ethical government to report what was going on to their [inspector general] and to the intelligence oversight committees, but there were no complaints lodged.\u201dBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Follow Robert Kraychik onTwitter.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\"We know that U.N.

Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens\u2014much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.\u2026At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors.

Actor Kevin Bacon recentlysaidonThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallonthat \u201cit\u2019s a good time for old white guys like me to just shut up and listen.\u201d While I understand his sentiment, I, for one, will not be quiet.You see, Kevin, a lot of ole white guys like myself, clawed and struggled for where we are in life. If you mean Kevin, white guys that were given a huge leg up in life by having a father who was a major figure in Architecture \u2014 the great Edmund Bacon \u2014 or a mother who was a liberal activist, then I understand. You see, Kevin, many were not born with the white privilege you grew up with. And I for one wish to speak out.Your call to muzzle ole white guys does a huge disservice to our nation during a time of perilous but exciting change. Many like myself grew up with a parent working three or four jobs to give us a chance at a better life. Many like myself grew up being the first in our family to attend college.The pomposity I see among so many of the privileged Hollywood community, where many make in a week what takes others five lifetimes, is nauseating. It seems almost a desperate attempt to make sure they are perceived as part of this movement that is using the emotions of our youth to topple the nation. Do you really believe that all the young people in America know the truth, Kevin? While many are well-meaning, they are being used Kevin and they still need guidance.I see too many people being sucked into a leftist vortex that has been orchestrated by powerful forces that wish harm to the country that has given us so much. You see, Kevin, I will speak out for better ways law enforcement can engage with people. I will speak out about how America\u2019s youth has been indoctrinated by a corrupt culture and education system that has neglected to teach the true greatness of America but instead peddles Marxist cultural propaganda.I have six children, much like your mom and dad, Kevin, and I have seen in several decades the chipping away at the values that made this country great. I, for one Kevin, will speak out against the dangers from the lack of assimilation we see from far too many in our immigrant population today. I will speak out about Ilan Omar, who has spit on this nation while being a member of Congress, who swore to protect and defend the nation she adopts as her own.I will speak out against the Left\u2019s attack on people of faith \u2014 where it seems mass protests are acceptable, but those who wish to worship are criminalized. I will speak out against those who punish all who dare to think differently. I will speak truth to those denigrating our flag and not standing for our national anthem.I will speak out Kevin against the globalist cabal that will not free humanity but enslave it. I will speak out about the Democratic Party, a political party that has ruined every city they are in power in. This destruction has occurred while all you bleeding hearts in Hollywood continue to bump fists over how great the party is. I will speak out against that hypocrisy, Kevin.What if all of Hollywood gave up their wealth and became a member of the proletariat? What if you and your lovely wife said, \u201cI am not worth more than a teacher\u2019s salary or say a Starbucks barista.

I will speak out, Kevin, against innocent unborn babies being aborted. This atrocity goes against nature, does it not Kevin? I mean, how can the Left condone abortion as a form of birth control? If black lives matter, do the leaders of that organization not realize that Margret Sanger is the woman who advocated abortion so as to control the black American birthrate?I will speak out against what we have done to the environment and how we must do all we can to protect the earth. I will speak out against rioting and looting. I will speak out against demonizing all police because of what some may do! I will speak out about how no one seems to care that actor Jussie Smollett lied and deceived. I will speak out against the mainstream\u00a0 media fueling the flames of racism.It\u2019s unAmerican for Kevin Bacon to demand \u201cold white guys\u201d or any American to keep their mouths shut. Political correctness has stabled our mouths shut for far too long. I will speak out against all the agitprop\u00a0that is used to separate us as human beings.Lastly, Kevin, since you made this about race, I will leave you and all who want to continue to fuel those hateful flames with this message from this wise young man, an angel.

The move came after President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to draw down forces in Germany, over the country\u2019s failures to meet its NATO spending requirements.The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement was signed by Pompeo and Polish Defence Minister Mariusz B\u0142aszczak. The agreement will give U.S. armed forces greater access to Polish military infrastructure and will create a framework for a sharing of costs between the two nations for the American military presence.The agreement will also lay the groundwork for a redeployment of American troops to Poland from Germany.In a statement from the White House, President Donald Trump said: \u201cThe agreement will enhance our military cooperation and increase the United States\u2019s military presence in Poland to further strengthen NATO deterrence, bolster European security, and help ensure democracy, freedom, and sovereignty.\u201d\u201cThis is going to be an extended guarantee: a guarantee that in case of a threat our soldiers are going to stand arm-in-arm,\u201d Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the signing ceremony.\u201cIt will also serve to increase the security of other countries in our part of Europe,\u201d the Polish leader said.\u201cThe opportunities are unlimited, the resources will be available,\u201d Pompeo said\u00a0at a news conference alongside Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz.At present, there are some 4,500 American troops stationed in Poland, with an additional 1,000 to be deployed to the Eastern European nation.The move comes one month after President Trumpannounceda reduction in forces from Germany, pledging to relocate troops to other European countries, including Poland.The Pentagon later confirmed that 12,000 U.S. troops would be moved out of Germany, of which 5,600 would be redeployed across the continent. Seven U.S. military commands will also be moved from Germany to Poland, including\u00a0the headquarters of the U.S. Army V Corps.Trump has long been critical of Germany for its failures to meet the spending requirements for members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In 2014, all NATO members pledged to spend at least two per cent of their respective gross domestic products on defence spending by the year 2024.According to the latest figures released from the military alliance, Germany \u2014 despite being the top economy in the EU \u2014 only spent1.38 per centof its GDP on defence in 2019. The country has said that it \u201chopes\u201d to reach the spending target by 2031.In an exclusive interview with Breitbart London, then-American Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said that Germany has been \u201cwoeful\u201d in living up to its commitments to NATO.\u201cGermany is the largest economy in Europe. They made a commitment to NATO, and they should be serious about that commitment; it is a multilateral institution that guarantees the allies, guaranteeing freedom,\u201d Grenellsaidin 2018.Poland, on the other hand, is one of the few NATO countries in Europe to meet its spending obligations.In 2018, the ambassadors from the United States and Polandwrotea joint statement, celebrating the deep ties between the two nations and hailing the \u201cshared democratic ideals are the heart of our 100-year-old friendship\u2026 [T]he bond between the United States and Poland is stronger than ever, and we are ready to face the next 100 years together.\u201dAP contributed to this storyFollow Kurt on Twitter at@KurtZindulka\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nGermany lost $$ billions from their trade with Communist China.

However, he also comes from a lot of money. A fact which has led the Lions signal-caller to label himself a person of \u201cprivilege,\u201d who now wants to get out of his \u201cbubble.\u201dIn an article titled,We Can\u2019t Just Stick to Football, Stafford insists that it\u2019s necessary for his team and others to address the perceived racial injustices in the country.\u201cPolice brutality, white privilege, racism \u2014 it\u2019s all real,\u201d Staffordclaims. \u201cThese are not political problems. These arehumanproblems. It should not be seen as a political statement to discuss this stuff honestly.\u201dStafford then wrote about his upbringing and the lack of diversity he experienced while growing up in a wealthy neighborhood.\u201cListen, I\u2019m not some perfect person,\u201d Stafford wrote in The Players Tribune. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to lecture anybody. I\u2019ve made a million mistakes. I grew up in Highland Park, Texas, which is probably\u00a0one of the most privilegedplacesin the country. It\u2019s a place that I still love very much, but it\u2019s a bubble. That\u2019s just a fact. I was not exposed to a lot of diversity or different ideas growing up. I was not educated on these issues, and I probably said a bunch of stupid things when I was young that I regret. But a big part of life is about looking inside yourself and trying to evolve as a person.\u201dStafford, who went to college in Georgia, wrote of all the experiences he\u2019s had with teammates of different races. Specifically, he tells a story about when he and fellow teammate Danny Amendola, who is white, worked out at an empty field, never having an issue. Though, after some black teammates decided to join them, a man called the police on them form trespassing.\u201cI was embarrassed to have put my teammates in that situation, especially when I was told that it was cool to use the field. Especially when I had been on the same field with Danny with no problems,\u201d Stafford wrote. \u201cThe only difference is what we all know in our hearts. Danny and I are white. We don\u2019t get the cops called on us in those situations. We don\u2019t immediately get called uncooperative.\u201dStafford is currently playing under a five-yearcontractworth $135,000,000.

He assessed widespread contemporary disillusionment among \u201ccommon people\u201d as being rooted in a fear of being \u201cleft behind\u201d in a future run by \u201csmart people.\u201d Such fears are justified, he added, given his projection that emerging technologies will displace economic needs to many categories of existing work:A lot of people sense that they are being left behind and left out of the story, even if their material conditions are still relatively good. In the 20th century, what was common to all the stories \u2014 the liberal, the fascist, the communist \u2014 is that the big heroes of the story were the common people, not necessarily all people, but if you lived, say, in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, life was very grim, but when you looked at the propaganda posters on the walls that depicted the glorious future, you were there. You looked at the posters which showed steel workers and farmers in heroic poses, and it was obvious that this is the future.Now, when people look at the posters on the walls, or listen to TED talks, they hear a lot of these these big ideas and big words about machine learning and genetic engineering and blockchain and globalization, and they are not there. They are no longer part of the story of the future, and I think that \u2014 again, this is a hypothesis \u2014 if I try to understand and to connect to the deep resentment of people, in many places around the world, part of what might be going there is people realize \u2014 and they\u2019re correct in thinking that \u2014 that, \u2018The future doesn\u2019t need me. You have all these smart people in California and in New York and in Beijing, and they are planning this amazing future with artificial intelligence and bio-engineering and in global connectivity and whatnot, and they don\u2019t need me. Maybe if they are nice, they will throw some crumbs my way like universal basic income,\u2019 but it\u2019s much worse psychologically to feel that you are useless than to feel that you are exploited.Harari contrasted the 20th century with the 21st while forecasting what he said is the current century\u2019s and future economies progressively diminishing need for human beings. He said:If you go back to the middle of the 20th century \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in the United States with Roosevelt, or if you\u2019re in Germany with Hitler, or even in the USSR with Stalin \u2014 and you think about building the future, then your building materials are those millions of people who are working hard in the factories, in the farms, the soldiers. You need them. You don\u2019t have any kind of future without them.\u201cNow, fast forward to the early 21st century when we just don\u2019t need the vast majority of the population,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbecause because the future is about developing more and more sophisticated technology, like artificial intelligence [and] bioengineering, Most people don\u2019t contribute anything to that, except perhaps for their data, and whatever people are still doing which is useful, these technologies increasingly will make redundant and will make it possible to replace the people.\u201d\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5944078900\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat may be part and parcel of the plan to achieve the WEF world's population goal.

Provide the stance type:\n            - EXPLICIT: when the stance is directly stated in the comment\n            - IMPLICIT: when the stance is implied but not explicitly stated\n\n        2.3 Extract key claims\n            - Extract the fundamental assertions or beliefs that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n            - Each key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n        \"target\": \"<target description - maximum 4 words>\", \n        \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE]>\", \n        \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT]>\",\n        \"key_claims\": \"<[ \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim 1>\", ...,\"I agree with the following: <extracted claim 2>\"]>\", \n        \"explanation\": \"<explanation of how the key claims support the stance classification>\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target expressed by the user's comment\n    ]\n    }\n\n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}]}}
