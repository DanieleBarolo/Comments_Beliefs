I really appreciate the stererotyping of the middle class...well done. You sound like a Medieval king talking about his plebes working in the fields outside your gate. So, I'm a middle class American with two professional degrees (that I paid for myself; daddy didn't prime the Alumni for my slot in college); I have a good job; a decent savings account, excellent credit, don't spend money on things unless I truly need them, don't drink or play the lotto, no big toys-boats, no big vacations, etc., etc. So, would you still call me one of those 'pissing and moaning' middle classers you know nothing about? You and your generation's greed is what is destroying this country from the inside out; not the fading middle class you are a part of destroying. Who is going to pick up the rich's tab, when the middle class is gone? Who will you blame then, for the failing status of this country's economy? Wake up and take a taste of reality brother. You have no clue what is really going on.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnecdotes are not data.

Never have to fear being intellectually intimidated around you. To wit: you confuse a rate with an amount, a difference you should have learned in third grade. If we go back to the Clinton era tax <b>rates</b> then the federal government will take in roughly 19% of GDP, significantly above the 14% it's taking in now. The <b> amount</b> of money taken in would be significantly above the Clinton era revenues, as would the amount the government spends, but that's because the overall economy is larger.\n\nNow give me a smile and tell me you love me.\n\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nooo\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They CANNOT tell you if an area will get more or less rainfall due to global warming.\n\nAll of the above outtakes in Kevin's figure are due to decreased water availability. Climate change could just as easily INCREASE regional water supplies, making it easier to produce electricity.\n\nClimate Change scaremongering helps no one.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nExactly right. \u00a0My wife keeps telling me we should save more for retirement, but I tell her she is scaremongering because it's just as likely that I will \u00a0HIT IT BIG as it is that we will be eating CATFOOD when we are old. \u00a0So saving money helps NO ONE.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n\u00a0Actually it was called Climate Change (IPCC--I actually worked on research for projects related to this) well before the Koch brothers came to our attention.

When he wouldn't eat dry food, we gave him tuna; when he wouldn't eat tuna anymore, we squeezed out tuna juice for him to drink; when he wouldn't drink the tuna juice anymore, and then within a day of that, wouldn't even drink water, we knew that was it.

I lived in the St. Louis area in the late 80s, where there were at least a dozen enclosed malls. One of those, on the far edge of an outlying suburb, closed in the early 90s while another was being remodeled into a mostly outdoor mall.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThis is an area I have some expertise.\nBegan working for DeBartolo Properties Management at the beginning of the 90's.  Was swept up in the Simon /Debartolo merger of 94 - 95.  Stayed with Simon until 2002 when it was clear malls were going the way of the Dodo bird. Note, Simon is still one of the largest retail REIT's in the market.\n\nWhile I think all of your speculation Kevin, played a role in the demise of the mall, the biggest culprit to me was money.  In the mid to late 90's, a class A property (we classify retail properties using a A - F designation, with F being the worst) could see $55 - $60 SF for a decent to prime location within the mall.  Compare that to $20 - $25 SF of a class A strip mall cost in today's dollars.\n\nThe business model of the mall was hemorrhaging cash when the economy began to turn in the late 90's.  Vacancies were up, tenants were re-negotiating their leases and we could not attract new tenants due to the cost.\n\nAlso, with the crazy retail days of the mid 90's, there was not any new trends or retailers that were making waves at the beginning of the aughts.  So a combination of a saturated market, no innovation or new players and the prohibitive costs of leasing a covered mall was the 3 nails in the coffin to this business model.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhat we really need is a drive through WalMart\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Hope you're feeling much better.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI just wish there was some better reporting on the details.  Everything I've read so far seems to lack critical details needed to make a judgement about how big an issue this is.  Where was this really hosted, how good was the security, what were the standards in determining which emails had to be provided for government archiving, why did Clinton use a private server instead of the state dept.  My default after decades of GOP cultivation of fake Clinton \"scandals\" is to presume this is more hyped up nonsense, but I hope some intrepid, tech savvy journalist continues digging.\n\nupdate: a couple minor details i found.  I looked up the history of the clintonemail.com domain and it was originally registered in 2009 by Justin Cooper, an adviser to Bill CLinton who, according to wikipedia, \"began working in the White House as an intern in the Office of Science and Technology Policy and later in the Oval Office. He was later hired as a Staff Assistant for Oval Office Operations.\" Today it's registration info is shielded by a middleman company called PERFECT PRIVACY, LLC. Not anything revelatory, but I hadn't seen that detail reported yet so I figured I'd write a quick post about it. I also noticed a traceroute dies at a zayo.com router, a company which provides \" bandwidth infrastructure services, including dark fiber, wavelengths, SONET, Ethernet, IP services, and carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection.\".\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nShe \"destroyed the bad ones\" would be in effect regardless of where her email was stored or what email system she used. Voir Benghazi and the IRS \"scandal\" (yes I know the IRS \"scandal\" wasn't HRC but it was an email \"question\").\n\nThere are a whole lot of people out there who think email storage is infinite and perpetual.  Only the NSA has that capability.  Even magnetic archiving is prone to flaws and errors, which increase as the media ages.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

The Greek government would be creating a new currency just to make it worth less than it was mere weeks earlier by devaluation, and this in a country that already has issues with tax evasion and a large shadow economy sector.

In every country there is a group of people who are the \"untouchables\" but we must ask why there are untouchables in the first place, and why we are so bent on having people to demonize, instead of working to create the land of liberty and justice for all?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Also, the fact that most white crime (theft, fraud, etc) doesn't fall in the descriptor of \"violent\" crime, it doesn't get reported as \"crime\" in most statistics, and results in lower rates of incarceration, although the extent of victimization is greater in fraudulent activity than one-on-one violent crime. Also, most crime resulting in incarceration committed by poorer people tends to be drug related non-violent crime, and gets reported whereas fraud etc doesn't. So, the crime statistics are seriously distorted by what we choose to call a crime.\n\nThink about it.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Seriously?\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nThere's nothing wrong with blaming culture in abstract for social ills. The reason why we liberals mock conservatives is because conservatives tend to have, at best, shaky correlation and commonsense prejudices to back up their accusations -- not to mention holding onto these explanations even when a much-better supported explanation is found such as the lead-crime hypothesis.\n\n\nA conservative blaming violent video games or a lack of prayer in the school isn't even in the same ballpark as a feminist decrying rape culture for the alarmingly high incidence of rape in American society. Because feminists actually have a little thing called, you know, <i>empiricism</i> on their side.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\non a related note, can the media stop referring to the postmortem ranting of every lunatic murderer as a \"manifesto\".  he's not a god damned philosopher just because he killed people.  thanks in advance, reporters.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nscanners for everything\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You always pay every tax from your accumulated wealth.  The \"name\" given to a tax just describes the means used to make you liable for the tax, and the means by which a tax will be calculated.\n\n\nThus, for example, when you choose to by a new high tech widget (perhaps a Spacley Sprocket), you become liable to tap into your wealth to pay taxes calculated on the value of the widget.  The trigger is that you took a cash asset and chose to replace cash with a different type of asset.  The trigger is your decision to convert the form of your assets.  The amount of wealth you pay in tax is calculated by the value of the widget.\n\n\nAll other taxes work the same.  Every tax is a wealth tax.  People fight about the trigger and about the means of calculation so they can conceal the total amount of wealth you are taxed each year.  By dividing the taxes up into small bites they assume you won't calculate the total.  They also use a variety of triggers to shape behavior.\n\n\nIf people wanted tax transparency, they would dump all taxes and replace them with one single unitary wealth tax.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI suppose it's no longer even worth observing how ironic the name \"Club for Growth\" is.

Just drive up and blow them away. Cops aren't accustomed to accountability. Police unions in NYC and Seattle have been reactionary. More murders increases perceived value of cops. Or so they think.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nPersonally, I think that the crime drp in the 90's corresponds to the huge increase of abortion accessibility in the 70's. As better pictures of fetuses has become available, there has been a corresponding decrease in the way most people feel about abortions. Increasingly state legislature has made abortions harder to get, and in some states, nearly impossible for the poor. I think this is the 20 year back swing og decreasing abortions. Just a thought. I think the book Freakanomics by Levitt discussed abortion and subsequent crime decrease connection. \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSort of a fact free assertion.

My point is that the cost of repairing the roads should be spread out to the major beneficiaries of road use that incidentally cause the most damage.  I wasn't really arguing for or against environmental costs. So, putting aside pollution, gas is an imperfect proxy for road damage. I doubt that trucks pay enough gas tax to cover the damage they do to roads (but yes, there are other truck fees, I am trying to point out that increasing the gas tax hits the wrong road users most severely). AND if gas is a proxy, what about electric vehicles?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It would be nice to see a follow up piece in other fields. I have published 50+ engineering papers (maybe 2 have had female authors) and I was the only author on one. It usually the first author who matters most.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI don't know the customs for different fields, but yeah, you want your name to be the name in \"NAME et al\" if possible.  I assume this is because there's a clear lead researcher.  It obviously wouldn't be fair if the only name that ever got shown is the alphabetically first one.\n\nBut even outside academia this has an impact. I would argue it's an even bigger impact, because it's on the general public, not a narrow field of interested researchers.  As Kevin notes, authors are typically listed alphabetically in economics.  Yet Deaton is regularly mentioned first in this discussion.\n\nEg this Forbes article: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/11/07/angus-deatons-paper-on-working-class-white-males-killing-themselves-might-not-be-right/\n\nHeadline: Angus Deaton's Paper On Working Class White Males Killing Themselves Might Not Be Right\n\n2nd Sentence: The basic point that Deaton and his partner (in both senses, his wife and also co-researcher on this paper) Anne Case\n\n\n\nFFS, could that be any more demeaning?  Her name is completely left out to start, and then her relationship to him is given a higher priority than the fact she was a \"co-researcher\".  As if he felt sorry for his feeble, weak-minded wife so he let her tag along.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nManagers are supposedly paid to reward high performers and pick stars.

He was skilled enough to make compromise sound heroic, but he ascended to the Presidency in a post-bipartisan era. Mitch McConnell figured out that bipartisanship disproportionately benefited the party in power. So he would have none of it. \n\nIronically, bipartisanship might be less threatening when Hillary takes over, since she would be incapable of taking credit for it. Not clear that would make a difference though: Republicans will still fear primaries more than they fear November.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nPeople have negative opinions about Hillary because they've been fed negative opinions about Hillary for 20+ years.  The people who actually know her and have worked with her seem to have a pretty high opinion of her.  There is a loop in effect where people end up blaming her for their own negative opinions about her.  For example, she's accused of being \"dishonest,\" she defends herself ( I thought pretty well), and the defense itself is a sign that she's dishonest, otherwise, why not just admit to being dishonest?  \n\nWhat we have now is a situation where some people (like Drum here) simply assume she is \"flawed,\" and see everything through that prism.  Obama is alleged to have been able to talk about politics in a way she can't -- but what did it get him?  Has he broken any logjams, changed any minds, made the Republicans any saner?  If anything, they are batshit crazier now than when he got into office, although perhaps they have fallen a little -- a very little -- below the peak crazy of 2009 - 2012.  But that's probably as much to do with demographics and economic factors as anything else -- I see no evidence that Obama's allegedly silver tongue had anything to do with it.  \n\nIf Hillary had Obama's record, Drum and others would be blaming her for the current state of affairs because of her \"inability to communicate\" or some such, because they start out with the assumption that something's wrong with her, and reason backwards (quite literally) from there.  Obama's lack of progress, by comparison, is seen as just a part of the landscape, something immutable and unremarkable.  It certainly has nothing to do with HIM.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYou want ME to research that for you?  Seriously? If all you want to do is say stuff, you can say stuff.

It was right in front of our eyes for a year and a half, and we'd been witnessing the republicans and their media minions whipping their base into a frenzy for 8 years against the Obama presidency with verbiage that was classic, early 50's McCarthy.

There is a paranoid cult, similar to cults that expect flying saucers to take them off the top of a mountain, and when that doesn't happen insist that their beliefs are true, they simply misinterpreted the alien messages.  Conservatism today meets the criteria for a cult: belief in things that just plain aren't true such as supply side economics, rich people work hard to get wealthy (most of them inherit it), inheritance taxes are double taxation, them others getting welfare are causing high taxes, them others are variously lazy, stealing our jobs, etc...the beliefs are staggeringly wrong and the believers can't believe their lying eyes.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

This bill will harm the children and elderly on Medicaid most of all.  Where will the Medicaid people living in nursing homes go?  Many of these people worked all their lives but have run through their savings (major illnesses could do that quickly).  What is the Republican solution?  Shoot them?  Let them starve or be murdered in the streets?\n\nThis is not a health care plan.

And as Republicans are currently demonstrating, that's a big problem when you've purged away everyone in your party who worries about details and implementation and consequences.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nPostscript: To repeat what I said yesterday....\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

What more can they want?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI would say the correct response is to haul him in front of a disciplinary committee, insist that he apologize personally to the class, determine whether this is part of a pattern of behavior, and THEN decide whether to fire him.  And they may well have done that, and he might have refused to apologize, or they might have determined that this is a pattern and decided to fire him for that reason, which would IMO be entirely appropriate.\n\nAn instructor is an authority figure, Hopkins is an educational institution (a private one BTW), and that kind of public display of bigotry is IMO completely inappropriate in that situation.\n\nI would add that, had he been in any of the major corporations where I have worked, he might well have been fired immediately.\n\nThere certainly are instances of hypersensitivity among students and among the organized left, to which I agree: chill out.

The result was a restraint upon wealth accumulation which necessarily contributed to far less income inequality than we have today. The Slate article mentions this:\n\n<i>One popular theory among left-leaning intellectuals right now\u2014advanced by Piketty, Saez, and their protege Stephanie Stantcheva\u2014is that high tax rates actually ease income inequality by discouraging CEOs and professionals from demanding exorbitantly high pay for their services. In other words, thanks to high tax rates, people didn\u2019t bother trying to get as rich. After all, there\u2019s no point in bargaining for a giant bonus if the government is going to clip off most of it.... So the real tax rates rich Americans paid in the 1950s may not have been so stratospherically high as some progressives assume. But they also may have helped create a more egalitarian society.</i>\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nEspecially if most of your income is unearned.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

In part because the color here is pretty unnatural anyway.\n\nIn fact, when I've shot stage performances with many colored lights I sometimes give up trying to get a decent white balance and just go with black and white - not for the art, not for the pretense, but because the only colors I can get are shit.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nOnce upon a time, I was a semi-professional photographer of sorts.  I acquired a well-deserved reputation of being much better in the darkroom than behind the camera, at least in black and white.  Much better at making the work of more talented photographers better than in taking the pictures myself.  Both honored that people who were really good would rather have me develop and print their stuff than do it themselves, much less the others and humbled by how much better they were than I could be.  (Honestly, they're why I gave it up).  \n\nAnd from that perspective, my beef with digital black and white is that the imperfection of film and paper technology is what made black and white great.  It's why it stuck around, decade after decade, after color became a thing.  Far more than is the case with color photography, a great black and white photograph was a product of the limitations of grain structure of the film and the paper, and the freehand hoodoo with dodging and burning done on the fly, while the timer on an enlarger counted down seconds, and even the imperfections that occurred--sometimes deliberately, sometimes serendipitously--as the result of the choice of the film developing fluid and the time-temperature relation.  No digital camera or editing software can really reproduce the imperfection.  \n\nMore than that, though, I lament the loss of the process of black and white itself, the way all practitioners of superseded technologies do.  The smell of the chemicals, the delicate work of loading film onto a reel by touch in total darkness.  The elusive, barely perceptible, flash of  triboluminescence when you pulled the tape holding the end of the film strip away from the cassette lose in total darkness.   Printing images by the dim light of an amber lamp. \nThe decadent thrill of breaking out the pricey, silver-rich, Ilford paper when doing prints for a show rather than the cheaper Kodak paper.  Rocking a tray while an image magically appeared, waiting for the exact moment when, despite the dim light, your experienced eye told you it needed to be pulled out and put into the stop bath.  \n\nIt didn't feel like science or engineering, or even art.  It felt like you were hidden away, safe from the superstitious, ignorant villagers in your sorcerer's dungeon, performing magic.  \n\nThat said, that picture of Kevin's is pretty good.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI agree, as a several language speaker.

Should it get to a sustained 4 percent (itself not terrible) easy to take action. What is hard and not obvious is low inflation as that is best dealt with fiscal policy - spending - and the developed world has itself in a bind there (entirely on board with the theoretical policy framework on spend counter-cyclically, the problem is making it happen in real world - rather like preaching to Journos against their real incentives not to pay attention to idiot memos).\n\nIn a world of low inflation, the central bank informal standard of 2%-3% really should be edged upwards to 3-4% for inflation targetting.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNo, only Democratic deficits do that.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBear market follows bull market.

The people who believe that blacks are genetically inferior are too stupid, too twisted and too locked into their racism to be swayed by any actual data. \n\nAnd besides, any research that conflicts with socioculturally primitive, right wing values is fake science at best, heretical ranting against the Invisible White Guy in the Sky at worst.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThe problem is the answer to bad pseudoscience isn't better pseudoscience.  It is actual science.\n\n\"White\" and \"black\" (and other traditional race terms) are not biological terms.  Specifically, those are not well-defined populations in the biological sense, and actual science has determined that if you go about defining human subpopulations using normal scientific methods, you end up with something quite different from the traditional races.\n\nSo that's that.  Once you know that, you can't do meaningful genetic population studies on whites and blacks because those aren't meaningful scientific populations.\n\nThat's a really important thing to know.  It is a point we should be making over and over until everyone gets it.  And that means we really shouldn't be doing what Kevin wants, because it is based on a false, and really quite harmful, premise.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nexactly.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

One of the the advantages of a city -- or at least an east-coast city -- is, it's walkable; you don't NEED a car the way you do in the burbs.  When I lived in NY -- where BTW I didn't mind density or high-rises; in fact, <I>they're among the reasons I moved there</i> -- only about 50% of residents in the city (including outer boroughs) owned cars, and some (like me) didn't even bring them into the city.  Cars <i>aren't necessary</i> in a city, and by the way, traffic in dense suburbs (e.g., NJ, suburban Philly, suburban DC, suburban Boston, and also smaller cities) is often every bit as bad as in the city.\n\nAlso, NIMBYism is a problem pretty much everywhere and in all things.  Sure a city dweller doesn't want a high-rise going in next door, but neither does a suburbanite want a McMansion going in next door, or indeed ANY construction nearby.  And traffic is a universal complaint.  Even a small commercial development -- which might allow WALKING in the burbs (as strange a concept as that may sound) -- is met with complaints about there-goes-the-neighborhood AND traffic.\n\nPlus, economies of scale are real, and they don't stop at a million.  Plus also, \"critical masses\" of certain kinds of talent are next to impossible to build in smaller cities.  Plus gerrymandering and political segregation, which has only emerged in the last maybe 3-4 decades. really?  Plus etc. and so on, too.  Feh.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI think it translates to McCabe didn't tell everything to his boss...which appears to be true-ish\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Save our ship. 30 states allow no excuse absentee ballot. 20 states allow absentee ballot with excuse, like on vacation, working out of state or lack of transportation. If you are prepared they can't refuse an absentee ballot. I can't wait to vote this time more than ever in my life.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWell good on you\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I would call myself a democratic socialist, but I also wouldn't be caught dead saying that I want to \"Destroy Capitalism.\" It's an asinine statement, especially in 2018, when we have no consensus idea of what either \"socialism\" or \"capitalism\" are. I certainly want to kick the living shit out of the idea that the market is either a panacea or the divine arbiter of all justice, and there are certainly a lot of Americans that believe that fool shit. But to argue that markets aren't often more effective at allocating goods than a centralized administration or a popular vote is asinine. There's just too much empirical proof. Just like there's tons of empirical proof that markets aren't always awesome all the time (and that they equal America!).

The market for labor is not competitive.  Contrary to the assumptions made by generations of economists, employers enjoy significant monopsony power in the labor market.  The solution is for workers to join together to develop countervailing monopoly power of their own; i.e., unions.  Or to use the power of government in the form of minimum wages and similar regulations.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat too.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

His call to have her on his show has nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman. Were she a man, he would have made the exact same request. It's her far-reaching and sometimes unrealistic ideas he wants to debate, not her gender. As a woman, frankly I find it extremely frustrating when women resort to playing the \"I'm a woman, you can't talk to me like that\" card when it's entirely unnecessary. He was treating her like any other democratic politician he doesn't agree with, she made it about the belittlement of women for no reason. And honestly, if I were a New Yorker, I'd want to know that the person running for Congress actually has a plausible way to carry out her plans, not just saying it because it sounds nice. If she can't hold her own, she shouldn't win the election.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWrong thread, sorry\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Anything that concentrates power is inherently corrupt, but I don't see that indirect government partial ownership of capitalistic ventures is inherently more corrupt except as an ideological meme.

He did his part. He repeated over and over again how terrible he felt about poor ol' Brat Kavanaugh's treatment without ever mentioning Ms. Ford by name or expressing one iota of compassion for her. \n\nMy guess is that one of his underlings was able to convince him that it would be a really-really bad idea for someone who has been accused of sexual assault by 16 women......many of whom he attacked viciously and repeatedly for complaining......to do anything that could fire up that story again with just 46 days until the mid terms and female voters already abandoning the GOP in ever increasing numbers.\n\nRemember what you see in the coming days, women voters of America. Ask yourself which party is trying to take rights, freedoms and protections away from you and your families and which one is fighting to protect them.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nSorry, WTF? simply not calling her a slut and too ugly to fuck is now \"respectful\"? Respectful enough that his aides are \"quietly stunned\"? I call bullshit on that whole article. It's not news, it's a fucking press release. \nHere's what he actually did: completely denied the validity of her story, impugned her credibility and continued to promote as unimpeachable (pun fully intended) the character of the guy accused. The ONLY FUCKING THING HE DID DIFFERENT is a couple of half hearted \"we'll see\" comments when press asked him his thoughts about an investigation. Which he is *refusing* to ask the FBI to conduct.\nSo, no. No fucking way is this respect.

Sounds about right.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNot on here, but on Twitter, I'm noticing an interesting (but infuriating) backlash that I'm assuming is from the past few weeks of women speaking loudly. There are increasingly more posts that downgrade women's accomplishments or imply that women are \"lesser\" than men overall. At first I thought I was just being hypersensitive, and I'm not saying that that might not be part of it. And these comments are coming from the conservative side, and in many cases from real idiots anyway.\n\nBut it's beginning to feel like the 1970's again. McConnell is calling the Kavanaugh protesters \"clowns\". And limitations on women's abilities are being stated very matter-of-factly. The following is a bad example, not least because Taylor Swift is not my kind of music, but it's one of the more obvious examples. Usually the innuendos are harder to quantify, out of context.\n\nAfter she came out in favor of a Democratic candidate, and explained her reasoning logically & coherently, there was the usual backlash. But within the predictable comments were things like calling her a \"mediocre woman\" or implying that she shouldn't be telling \"hardworking Tennesseans\" what to do.\n\nLike her music or not, \"mediocre\" is ridiculous. And anyone who knows anything about writing, recording & producing music, let alone touring with a huge roadshow (including choreography) and doing publicity, would know that she probably works harder than most of those Tennesseans. You don't garner numerous awards for numerous albums, with many songs she wrote herself, and amass a net worth of over $300 million in 12 years of performing, by sitting around twirling your hair. And it was very reminiscent of Chuck Grassley stating that the GOP side of the Judiciary Committee had no women (and never had) because it was probably too much work for them (there's another example!).\n\nFor many of you it might be easy to suggest that these jerks just be ignored. But again, I remember the 70's, when it was news & had to be emphasized that of course women could be doctors, attorneys, CPA's (not \"just\" bookkeepers), engineers, etc. That our place wasn't only in the home or on the boss' lap. As I'm assuming people of color feel right now, too, we've fought these fights -- over and over and over -- and now we're going back again, and it's happening FAST.\n\nSo, much longer post than intended, but please -- if you see others or yourself starting to use a more diminishing tone towards women, please push back.

Sounds about right.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNot on here, but on Twitter, I'm noticing an interesting (but infuriating) backlash that I'm assuming is from the past few weeks of women speaking loudly. There are increasingly more posts that downgrade women's accomplishments or imply that women are \"lesser\" than men overall. At first I thought I was just being hypersensitive, and I'm not saying that that might not be part of it. And these comments are coming from the conservative side, and in many cases from real idiots anyway.\n\nBut it's beginning to feel like the 1970's again. McConnell is calling the Kavanaugh protesters \"clowns\". And limitations on women's abilities are being stated very matter-of-factly. The following is a bad example, not least because Taylor Swift is not my kind of music, but it's one of the more obvious examples. Usually the innuendos are harder to quantify, out of context.\n\nAfter she came out in favor of a Democratic candidate, and explained her reasoning logically & coherently, there was the usual backlash. But within the predictable comments were things like calling her a \"mediocre woman\" or implying that she shouldn't be telling \"hardworking Tennesseans\" what to do.\n\nLike her music or not, \"mediocre\" is ridiculous. And anyone who knows anything about writing, recording & producing music, let alone touring with a huge roadshow (including choreography) and doing publicity, would know that she probably works harder than most of those Tennesseans. You don't garner numerous awards for numerous albums, with many songs she wrote herself, and amass a net worth of over $300 million in 12 years of performing, by sitting around twirling your hair. And it was very reminiscent of Chuck Grassley stating that the GOP side of the Judiciary Committee had no women (and never had) because it was probably too much work for them (there's another example!).\n\nFor many of you it might be easy to suggest that these jerks just be ignored. But again, I remember the 70's, when it was news & had to be emphasized that of course women could be doctors, attorneys, CPA's (not \"just\" bookkeepers), engineers, etc. That our place wasn't only in the home or on the boss' lap. As I'm assuming people of color feel right now, too, we've fought these fights -- over and over and over -- and now we're going back again, and it's happening FAST.\n\nSo, much longer post than intended, but please -- if you see others or yourself starting to use a more diminishing tone towards women, please push back. I don't think I have the heart to go through the 70's again.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nTuna salad today?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Hence, I\u2019m going to take a tangent.  We have Beveridge\u2019s law for headlines posed as yes/no questions.  Is there an analogous law for A or B choiced questions?  I.e., is it A or B?  Answer: both or somewhere in between. How about a law for self-reflexive questions?  Am I being jerk?  Am I taking us off topic?  Answer: yes.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nBeing female and perhaps shielded a bit from the slings of PC culture simply because of my gender, I will bravely wade in. \n\nWith my waders on, I note the psychological characteristics discussed are Europatriarchal gender expectations. Not surprisingly. Europatriarchal cultures, which are richer, display more Europatriarchal gender expectations. The validity of this study is probably as good as economic studies of consumer behavior based on white male college students in American universities. I also note that there is a lot of culturally enforced gender disparity in the US, which of course feminism seeks to address. It really doesn't matter how rich you are in the US, gender norms are still rigorously policed for most people.\n\nWhen we stop telling people how to behave depending on what their physiology is, and we have at least one generation of purely neutral expectations of our children, then and only then can we see if there truly are such divergent gender characteristics. And at that point we probably won't care.\n\nI also want to point out that the study addresses behavioral characteristics, not intellectual capabilities.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOh boy.

That's because Republican voters respond to different things than Democratic ones do, and if you want politicians with the kinds of personalities that Republicans routinely elect you need to figure out how to get Democratic voters to not start looking for the exits when it comes to supporting them.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAvenatti is toast.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022America / USA\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Police\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022China\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Would like to see a study on the nuances of female and male lawyer and politician's brains.\n\nPS - nice sculpture of the brain.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n<I>In this case, for example, the authors should say, clearly and up front, that sex differences in the brain are real and important, and <u>then</u> explain just how much practical difference they make and how they interact with social stereotypes and cultural cues. </I>\nI think that the flaw in this logic is that researchers don't really know how much practical difference any of these sex differences make. They can't separate out the biological differences at the time the people are studied from the environmental shaping that's occurred throughout people's lives.\nHere's a classic example: there are structural differences in the brains of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as compared to people without that diagnosis. But researchers can't say for sure that the structural differences *cause* the Schizophrenia, or if changes in the function of the brain which manifests as schizophrenia then goes on to cause the structural changes.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI would say there is a very large portion of the population that thinks men are human and women are less than fully human. See Peterson, Jordan, for example. Or evolutionary biologists.

Schultz, like other public-facing billionaires, may genuinely believe that Trump is unacceptably racist and incompetent, but he and they also apparently believe that the only thing worse than a catastrophe like Trump is a tax level high enough restore public faith in the American political system.\n\nSchultz himself has spent the week treating popular ideas like tuition-free public college (which would not be very expensive) and single-payer health insurance (which many countries pay for handily, and would mostly just move money we already spend on to the federal balance sheet) like ludicrous pipe dreams. He calls plans to reduce inequality\u2014by raising the top tax rate to where it once was, or by taxing exorbitant wealth like they do in some European democracies\u2014\u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\nIn this way, Schultz resembles the global plutocratic elites who last week welcomed Brazil\u2019s new president, the aspiring tyrant Jair Bolsonaro, to Davos, then mocked the growing international clamor for higher marginal tax rates on the rich, called critics communists, and brushed off responsibility for inequality, war, and climate change. He also resembles the executives who theatrically withdrew from Trump\u2019s now-aborted economic advisory panels after Trump praised the Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, VA, then participated without fanfare in a gross GOP propaganda campaign to help Trump tout his multi-trillion dollar corporate tax cut.\n\nSchultz\u2019s candidacy is a counterpoint to corporate America\u2019s winking complicity with Trump\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s a warning from donors to Democrats not to respond to Trumpism with an appeal to working-class solidarity\u2014a threat to boobytrap the applecart if Democrats promise to upset it.\n\n\"HOWARD SCHULTZ AND THE PLUTOCRAT REVOLT\"\nhttps://crooked.com/articles/howard-schultz-plutocrats/\n</blockquote>\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nExactly.

California is 5th largest economy in the world, $3 trillion dollars.  American Latino's are the 11th largest economy in the world.  California is a \"SANCTUARY STATE\", it is \"MINORITY MAJORITY\", it is only 37% White, Latinos are the Majority, more languages are spoken other than English, that in any other State.  It is \"CULTURALLY DIVERSE\".  There is a 20 Billion dollar surplus in the State and the median home price is $550,000.   Compare that with the \"90% White States\" and the \"WHITE SUPREMACY\" argument falls apart.
