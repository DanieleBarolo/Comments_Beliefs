You might be able to cherry pick some minor similarities, but you really can't compare expected civil disobedience handled by local law enforcement with an organized attack on the in-session Capitol building to stop election certification which was and still is a national security concern.  You dopes used to care about national security.

Garland's speech yesterday and President Biden labelin' Trump as the undisputed leader of the #January6th attack sounds like a one-two punch kickin' off 2022 as the year of accountability for those who sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

PARENT COMMENT:
Right along side those that obstructed the Kavanaugh hearings, those that pounded on the doors of the Supreme Court, those that broke into the Dept of Interior and especially those that burned federal courts houses and set up autonomous zones.  All deeds of sedition and insurrection.
