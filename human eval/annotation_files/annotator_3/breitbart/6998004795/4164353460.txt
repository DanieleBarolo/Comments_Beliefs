That's right--it must be the Deep State/MSM cabal!!!  If only there was some way to give the Republican's a tiny increment of power in this country, we'd all learn The Truth!!!  But alas, the liberals are the only ones with any power .....

People always say that you can't fix stupid.  But I think it's even harder to fix gullible.  Go on dreaming the delusion, squidie.

They're busy putting a MAGA hat and the Confederate Battle Standard in his place of residence.

PARENT COMMENT:
It wouldn't surprise me if the suspect had some connection to CNN. Fake news loves to be the victim. Either way, fake news is only reporting that it's a man in his 50's. No mention of prior arrests. If he was a MAGA hat wearing white supremacists, we'd have pictures and twitter feeds already.

Edit-
To all the hate spewing liberal trolls frothing at the mouth over the news reports that have been rolling out over the last few hours:

No one who is seriously discussing this as a false flag event expects the news media to report any differently then they are. You're wasting your breath with "I told you so" and "gotcha" comments. Go back to HuffPo where someone might pretend to give a crap what you have to say.

      We need Judicial Watch to request the text and email content of the arresting officers now. The cover-up is already underway.
