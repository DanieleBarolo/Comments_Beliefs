I don't 'have to keep telling myself' that, the ratings say it for me, over and over. 



You don't understand, I don't freakin' care, I don't watch either.

One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .

Do you know what the ultimate weird-out is? While Bill O'Reilly is the ratings leader - his viewership STILL translates to somewhat less than ONE PERCENT of America! Which means, he's got about 13 drooling old men pounding their canes on the floor and... EVERY FUCKING LIBERAL IN AMERICA! NO-body else CARES about what he, Limbaugh, Hannity ever says EXCEPT "the Daily Show", "Young Turks", Daily Kos... if the LIBERALS simply STOPPED getting their hate jollies on by studying him so intensely - he'd be off the air in a week. No viewers.

  No Viewers? You must be talking about MSNBC. The reruns of Forensic files on HLN get better ratings than MSNBC, LMAO!! We have local cable shows that get better ratings than MSNBC!! LIberals are loser scum with good intentions but bad outcomes!!
