Prop. 32 Could Turn California Purple in Future Elections

# Oldest comment (from the thread):
Lord willing, the few conservatives left here in this state, myself included, can make the changes necessary to repair the damages done by the progressives and the unions who fund them.  We have been outnumbered for so long and with more leaving every week it has seemed like the best course of action to take.  I pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.

Most of Orange County isn't as conservative as it used to be in the late '80s. Only south Orange County remains relativey conservative, but even this will change since liberals are moving in high numbers.
