Okay, I'll ask you directly: Why do you just believe whatever Trump says when you know he lies to you and the American people all the time?

So, how do you stop someone from being manipulated by liars when they not only want to be manipulated, but relish it?  Or, rather, what do you do with people who just decide something is true (or isn't true) just because they want it to be (or don't want it to be) regardless of the facts?
