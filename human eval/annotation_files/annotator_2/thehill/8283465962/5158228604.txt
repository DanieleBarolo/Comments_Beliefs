There's a reason Guiliani and Powell are laying out their case in a press conference instead of a courtroom.

I wonder what the 30 Republican state legislatures are thinking.
Normally they follow the popular vote when choosing electors but the US Constitution allows them to do as they please.
And in the face of such massive, highky organized Democrat voter fraud, they should consider it their patriotic duty to REJECT Ballot Fraud Biden on December 14.
Remind them of their patriotic duty, Trump Republicans...and warn them as well.
