A good outcome as the commission would have released the report by the end of the year, which was intended by Pelosi to use in 22' as a wedge issue. It is also why she rejected including the rioting last summer for the the commission to look at as well. That didn't help democrats last November and they do not want to see or hear  it next year at all.
