No one is going to take away your pacifier dude.  We don't want to see what you look like without sleep.

If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

"... about our deep investigation into the economic toll from gun violence, which dings America for no less than $229 billion a year. (Yes, that's capital 'B' billion ..."

"Read their whole July 2012 piece, look at the findings
 from our new data investigation, and you'll also begin to see—another 
100,000 deaths, 250,000 injuries, and one unthinkable elementary school 
massacre later—just how much we still don't know."

Nor do we know how much it "cost" the fine democratic republic that was 1933 to 1945 Germany that extinguished the lives of about 12,000,000 "Untermenschen".  The economic toll was however, somewhat offset by the fact that they were (at least in some cases) simply worked to death...


But never let history or human nature dictate policy.  We know the founders didn't - and that is why they never actually put the 2nd Amendment in the Bill of Rights... 

Because those that do not understand that the real threat to human lives is not the legal gun owner - it is the tyrant - that is the real threat.

  Sure. Because our democratically-elected government is just like the Third Reich.

    Gee - didn't you know?  Herr Hitler WAS democratically elected...

Keep reading your history - someday you too will understand.

      Are you really as frightened as you seem, or have you merely manufactured such fear in order to provide yourself an excuse to play with guns?
