  "article_body": "As someone who suffers through the left-wing monotone of CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer for two hours a day, I can tell you that Blitzer spews opinions all the time. Wolf is especially good at reassuring America that President Obama really,really, REALLY cares about what the everyday American is concerned about. Wednesday, though, Wolf slipped and spouted an opinion of which Obama and the media\u2019s Narrative Plantation Overseers did not approve. He has since taken it back.During a segment about the ObamaCare launch debacle, Blitzer said, \u201cThey had three years to get this ready. If they weren\u2019t fully ready, they should accept the advice Republicans are giving them, delay it for a year, get it ready and make sure it works.\u201d\u2014\u2014Immediately, Blitzer\u2019s media colleagues hauled their pal into Room 101 andstrapped a caged rat to his face.Soon after, Blitzer tweeted this:\u2014October 9, 2013\" data-btlnk=\"\n<p>Context matters. Earlier I said the govt shouldn\u2019t launch a website before it works. I did not express a view about the individual mandate.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Wolf Blitzer (@wolfblitzer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wolfblitzer/statuses/388084677082243073\">October 9, 2013</a></p>\" class=\"bnn-if-tweet\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"260\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">\u2014The tweet doesn\u2019t even make sense. The GOP are not giving Obama advice about postponing the launch of the website. This is all about the mandate. Period.But truth and logic do not matter. What matters is that Blitzer has publicly stated that today we are at war with Eastasia.All day long, CNN anchors spew left-wing, government-approved opinion. But step off the Narrative Plantation just ONCE, and it is just a matter of hours before you get a re-educated retraction.Follow\u00a0 John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC",

However, let \nus be clear that what we are seeing right now isn't liberalism...it is a totalitarian system\nexercised with a heavy hand. Members of the media prostituted themselves for \nthe cause of liberalism and became lapdogs for the Democrat party. They sold\nthemselves to the devil when they used every lie and manipulated ignorant \nAmerican voters so Obama would win. Now they have their master at the White\nHouse and they dare not tell the truth or they will be punished. They should be\nreal proud of themselves! Useful idiots!!",
