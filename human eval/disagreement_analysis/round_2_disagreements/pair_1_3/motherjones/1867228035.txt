and the Cherokee agreed to relocate to Oklahoma and ceding land in Georgia via Treaty with the United States... does that mean the Trail of Tears and being forced to march due to threat of arms never happened?

One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .

PARENT COMMENT:
You really are quite ignorant in all of this. 

The UK is a parliamentary democracy, not a monarchy.

The full title of Elizabeth is "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith." she is not the Queen of England, even if you put England in bold.

Scotland was not 'conquered' by England, neither was Northern Ireland. Scotland and England entered into a treaty passed by both the Parliaments of England and Scotland in 1707. Scotland has its own legal system, as different to England as it is different to the legal system of the USA. English Law does not exist in Scotland. 

As regards the situation in Northern Ireland, if you have difficulty in understanding the difference between England and the UK, then trying to explain the history of Northern Ireland would be like hitting my head off a brick wall. 

Before you start posting anything, I would make sure you have the slightest idea what you are posting about.

The Falkands War wasn't between England and Argentina, it was between the United Kingdom and Argentina. England is a not a synonym for the United Kingdom.

    It's really not. England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. Using it to refer to the entirety would be like using California or Texas to refer to the USA.

Just because you are ignorant of the difference doesn't mean that the difference doesn't exist.

      Not exactly.  The governance of the british Isles is complex, but in essence great britain and England are interchangeable, due to the fact that England is a part of the British government, which is dominated and controlled by England.

        No, it'd really not. I suggest you ask how English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish people feel. That you believe that English is interchangeable with Great Britain, or more accurately, British, only demonstrates your lack of understanding in this matter.

          Feelings are fun, facts are more entertaining.  The United kingdom is a monarchy.  The monarch is currently Elizabeth the second, queen of <b>England</b>(among other titles, but the first, formost, and most common title is Queen of England).  Again, as I have already stated, the status of the situation is complex.  When you start unwrapping the entire Gordian knot, what it comes down to is that the other three 'nations' were conquered centuries ago by England, and retain their names as regions allowed limited internal autonomy, Subject to English Law.
