When your persona begins to take over your music and becomes more important, you enter a dangerous place. Once you have people around you who don’t question you, you’re in a dangerous place,” John told the newspaper. “Look at Lindsay Lohan. There was someone with a successful career and her parents completely [expletive] her up. The dad was in jail and the mum was doing coke with her. Great!”He went on to say he looks at Cyrus and sees “a meltdown waiting to happen.”“And she’s so young!” John said. “But she’s got two records in the top 20, so who is going to stop her?”", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/09/17/Elton-John-says-he-is-concerned-about-Miley-Cyrus--Lady-Gaga"}
