They must have brainwashed you pretty good to be that clueless.   Yes chemicals get approved but it is not because of lack of toxicity but rather the justification for the need to use them just like any drug but they have side effects.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

That year, soybeans fetched $9.00 in the market, resulting in a GM seed-to-soybean price ratio of 5.5. The conventional seed-to-soybean ratio was 3.7.\n\nFarmers purchasing the most closely followed new soybean seed product in 2010 Monsanto\u2019s Roundup Ready (RR) 2 soybeans will pay 42% more per bag than they paid for RR soybeans in 2009. The RR 2 soybean seed-to-soybean price ratio will be around 7.8, over three times the historic norm.\n\nFor conventional farmers planting saved soybean seed an option precluded by purchase of GM seeds the seed-to-soybean price premium will be about 1.2 in 2010.\n\nIn the 25 years from 1975 through 2000, soybean seed prices rose a modest 63%. Over the next ten years, as GM soybeans came to dominate the market, the price rose an additional 230%. The $70 per bag price set for RR 2 soybeans in 2010 is twice the cost of conventional seed and reflects a 143% increase in the price of GM seed since 2001.\n\nThe organic soybean seed price premium, compared to conventional seed, is much smaller and will stand at about 33.4% in 2010. The GM seed price premium is projected at 63.5%. Accordingly, the biotech seed price premium exceeds the organic seed price premium by 1.9-fold.\"\"\n\nhttp://www.gmwatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11799:new-evidence-shows-huge-price-rises-for-gm-seed-summary-by-gmwatch\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

My two cents.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI think this important to this debate.\n.\n\"\"One of the main arguments behind creating these engineered crops is that farmers then need to use less herbicide and pesticide.  This makes farms more eco-friendly, say proponents of genetically modified (GM) crops, and GM seeds also allow farmers to spend less on \u201cinputs\u201d (chemicals), thereby making a greater profit.\n.\nBut a new study released by Food & Water Watch yesterday finds the goal of reduced chemical use has not panned out as planned.  In fact, according to the USDA and EPA data used in the report, the quick adoption of genetically engineered crops by farmers has increased herbicide use over the past 9 years in the U.S.  The report follows on the heels of another such study  by Washington State University research professor Charles Benbrook just last year.\n.\nBoth reports focus on \u201csuperweeds.\u201d It turns out that spraying a pesticide repeatedly selects for weeds which also resist the chemical.  Ever more resistant weeds are then  bred, able to withstand increasing amounts \u2013 and often different forms \u2013 of herbicide.\n.\nAt the center of debate is the pesticide glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto MON -0.78%\u2018s Round Up.  Food & Water Watch found that the \u201ctotal volume of glyphosate applied to the three biggest GE crops \u2014 corn, cotton and soybeans \u2014 increased 10-fold from 15 million pounds in 1996 to 159 million pounds in 2012.\u201d  Overall pesticide use decreased only in the first few years GE crops were used (42 percent between 1998 and 2001) and has since then risen by 26 percent from 2001 to 2010.\n.\nBy 2011 there were also three times as many herbicide-resistant weeds found in farmer\u2019s fields as there were in 2001.\n.\nThis has meant huge profits for agribusinesses developing and selling genetically engineered seeds, herbicides and pesticides.  Seed revenues have septupled (increased seven fold) since 1998.\"\"\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/07/02/gmo-crops-mean-more-herbicide-not-less/\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Not only that they released dioxin to the environment.  They have even claimed Dioxin was safe.  \n.\n\"\"On February 23, 1990, Jenkins sent a memorandum to the EPA Science Advisory Board entitled 'Newly Revealed Fraud by Monsanto in an Epidemiological Study Used by EPA to Assess Human Health Effects from Dioxins', attaching a copy of part of the Kemner Plaintiffs-Appellees' brief dealing with the Monsanto studies. She requested that the Board or the EPA Office of Research and Development, audit the records of these studies to see if they were flawed\"\"\"\n.\n\"\"According to Dean Kokkoris, an attorney for the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange (VAVA) class action lawsuit against the chemical manufacturers, \"C.H. Boehringer Sohn discovered a way to minimize the dioxin content in a substance by keeping down the temperature in the autoclave [during manufacture]. . . . Dow, Monsanto, and Diamond Shamrock were able to make a batch of Agent Orange in about forty-five minutes, but if they'd lowered the temperatures, it would have taken a lot longer-- possibly twelve hours-- to make the same batch of herbicide. By keeping the autoclave temperatures higher, they made it more quickly and for a lot cheaper. Dow and other manufacturers of Agent Orange ignored the safety precautions because they wanted to make Agent Orange more quickly, and they wanted to make more of it.\"[\"\"\n\nhttp://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Monsanto,_Agent_Orange,_Dioxins_and_Plan_Colombia\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

To top it off, they demand to not pay taxes for it.  \n\n\nThe protests were never going to solve it because the oligarchy's only means to acquire massive wealth is through hacking and so they have bought the whole thing.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If treatment is ever on the horizon \"Rick Simpson Oil\" will be the first thing I do.  Others with the same type of cancer have used it with surprising results, some even have markers return to normal and stay that way.  That is why I am optimistic.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nFor a war, the war on cancer is shamefully underfunded.  2 Trillion spent handing Iraq over to Iran (and Sunni extremists), and the NIH has to split a paltry 30 billion a year between cancer, alzheimer's, heart disease, and all the other human ailments which kill the same number of Americans that died in 9/11 every week.\n\nYes we're making progress despite this, but if it's a war where is our GI bill?  Why can't a young person interested in science and looking to fight America's enemies offer to spend 4 years working in a cancer research lab and have the government pick up the tab for their undergraduate degree in return?  If you want to encourage people into useful, beneficial careers - make it an affordable option.  Nobody outside a few pharma execs are getting rich fighting cancer, but at least remove the burden of debt from those willing to serve.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHow is that proving anything if you already had cancer.   \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Sturm, Ruger & Company raised $1.25 million through a program in which it donated $1 to the NRA-ILA for each gun it sold from May 2011 to May 2012. In a similar program, gun buyers and participating stores are invited to \"round up\" the purchase price to the nearest dollar as a voluntary contribution. According to the NRA's 2010 tax forms, the \"round-up\" funds have been allocated to both public interest programs and lobbying.[128]\n\nIn 2010, the NRA reported revenue of $227.8 million and expenses of $243.5 million,[149] with revenue including roughly $115 million generated from fundraising, sales, advertising and royalties, and most of the rest from membership dues.[147] Corporate sponsors include a variety of companies such as outdoors supply, sporting goods companies, and firearm manufacturers.[147][150] The same year, the NRA Foundation distributed $21.2 million in grants for gun-related training and education programs: $12.6 million to the NRA itself, and the rest to community programs for hunters, competitive shooters, gun collectors, and law enforcement, and to women and youth groups, such as the Boy Scouts and 4-H clubs.[128]\"\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

The strong law states' firearm-related homicide rate was also 40% lower and their firearm-related suicide rate was 37% lower.\"\"\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/07/gun-violence-study-chicago/1969227/\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Victims of suicide living in homes with guns were more than 30 times more likely to have died from a firearm-related suicide than from one committed with a different method. Guns are highly lethal, require little preparation, and may be chosen over less lethal methods to commit suicide, particularly when the suicide is impulsive. Suicidal persons may also be more likely to acquire a gun to commit suicide and, given the lethality of the weapon, are more likely to complete suicide, although the evidence on this point is mixed\"\"\n\nhttp://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Not that there is anything wrong about teaching transient knowledge but it is not material component of most jobs and if required, the knowledge can be acquired.\n\n\nThe education as an industry today  lives via paranoia of population and  that is why it claims that  vast knowledge are required to run the mundane jobs that the typical  industries provide but in reality that is not the case.   Their new scheme was to fly a new industry and that is testing industry which they had hacked the job market to enlist in it too.\n\n\nAs an industry that is listed in stock market and seeking growth, the testing growth is only way sustain their cash flow and that is what is happening.  \n\n\n\nI suggest that the only way to stop the paranoia is to create a pass/fail status for all subjects and remove marks and excessive filtering.  Simplifying schooling should reduce the fixation about higher education.   Allowing passing series of pass/fail courses to lead towards all degrees will help the remove the constant desire for filtering.  Courses can be repeated till people pass the subject and continuation of a given  paths to  degrees and certificates.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They voted for the statehood option and there are no clauses in anywhere  that would demand any different type of referendum.  The truth is that GOP is pretty much  racist and they are unlikely to get their votes and that they would block it and they did .   Your narrative about IMF is also  hacked.

Because the island remains a territory, the  decision is ultimately out of boricuas\u2019 hands. Only the federal\n Congress, to which the island appoints a non-voting \u201cresident  commissioner\u201d, can grant statehood, which it has not done since it  admitted Hawaii in 1959. Until the most recent referendum, Puerto Ricans had never voted in favour of statehood\"\"\n..\n\"\"the Republican  Party would surely use every tactic at its disposal to block a statehood\n bill. Exit polls showed that last year Barack Obama won 83% of the  presidential vote among Puerto Ricans living on the mainland. Adding two Democratic-leaning senators, five representatives and seven  presidential electoral votes would be a political nightmare for the GOP. \"\"\n\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/10/economist-explains-15\n\n              \n\"\"Jeffrey D.

While medical devices (like the epipen) do undergo rigorous testing (and they ABSOLUTELY should), there needs to be incentives for generics and/or other companies to do more work with devices.  The problem is that most generic companies do almost no research (they rely on the original development and present a 'bio-similar' to avoid R&D), and can therefore not compete with complicated devices like this.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNot mentioned: \n1. The Epipen's active ingredient is generic.\n2. An Epipen costs less than $5 to manufacture.\n3.

While medical devices (like the epipen) do undergo rigorous testing (and they ABSOLUTELY should), there needs to be incentives for generics and/or other companies to do more work with devices.  The problem is that most generic companies do almost no research (they rely on the original development and present a 'bio-similar' to avoid R&D), and can therefore not compete with complicated devices like this.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nNot mentioned: \n1. The Epipen's active ingredient is generic.\n2. An Epipen costs less than $5 to manufacture.\n3. Taxpayers funded development of Epipen technology.\n\nSo an Epipen perfectly encapsulates everything wrong with a pharmaceutical industry that has too much market power.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat is rant to claim that you don't know how the market was hacked as I supplied references.\n\nYou just pretend that you don't know and that is not a valid argument.

However, little is known about what transpired when firelight extended the day, creating effective time for social activities that did not conflict with productive time for subsistence activities. Comparison of 174 day and nighttime conversations among the Ju/\u2019hoan (!Kung) Bushmen of southern Africa, supplemented by 68 translated texts, suggests that day talk centers on economic matters and gossip to regulate social relations. Night activities steer away from tensions of the   day to singing, dancing, religious ceremonies, and enthralling stories, often about known people. Such stories describe the  workings of entire institutions in a small-scale society with little formal teaching. Night talk plays an important role in evoking higher orders of theory of mind via the imagination, conveying attributes of people in broad networks (virtual communities),  and transmitting the \u201cbig picture\u201d of cultural institutions that generate regularity of behavior, cooperation,and trust at the regional level. Findings from the Ju/\u2019hoan are compared with other hunter-gatherer societies and related  to the widespread human use of firelight for intimate conversation and our appetite for evening stories...\"\n\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/111/39/14027.full\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

In his world, Cash wins  over Labor which is a  form of  religious indoctrination rights by businesses!!\n\nSo this is how women are treated as chattel owned by oligarchy..

Same thing he said after Las Vegas. But a month has gone by since the Mandalay massacre that killed and wounded more than 500 people, isn't it time to talk about <u>that</u> tragedy yet? Or does a fresh mass execution-by-gun start the \"it's not time to talk\" clock all over again? At that rate, it will <u>never</u> be time to talk about gun control.\n\n(2) \"It's a mental health problem at the highest levels.\"..... Same thing the gun lobby spews after every tragedy, like when Wild Wayne La Pierre ranted post-Sandy Hook that.... \"We have a mental health system in this country that has completely and totally collapsed. We have no national database of these lunatics.\" \n\nThat was almost five years ago, yet the NRAGOP has done nothing substantive to promote an expansion/upgrade of our \"collapsed\" mental health system, nor has there been any more talk about a \"national database of lunatics\". In fact, the republicans have continued whittling away at mental health funding and tried to further undercut it with Obamacare repeal/replace.\n\n(3) Trump was asked whether he had considered extreme vetting for U.S. citizens seeking to buy a gun. (Gotcha!) He replied: \"If you did what you are suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago.\" ..... He made his NRA handlers proud with that bit of head-up-the-ass retrograde prognostication.\n\n(4) \"I can only say this. If [Willeford] didn't have a gun, instead of 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead. So that's the way I feel about it, not going to help.\" ..... More prognostication. Of course he didn't say where the hundreds more dead would have come from, but that's not important. He's implying stricter gun control laws put Americans at <u>greater</u> risk of gun violence. \n\nGood propagandists deal in fear and loathing imagery. All that matters is that there are now tens of millions of brain-dead trumpians running around meme-ing that the \"good guy with a gun\" stopped hundreds from being killed and that's the only thing that's ever going to stop gun violence because \"dangerous\" gun laws never work.\n\n <b>The National Rifle Association now owns the American presidency and the Congress of the United States.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nEven if they had entered it.

We can change things if we look at science and learn from it. We won't change things if we don't face facts. It is keeping with the conservative brain to be fearful of new ideas and to shut out data they don't like without  considering the possibilities. They scoff first before even considering the data.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nthere is no more \"Neanderthalish\"....what early anthropologists thought about Neanderthals has now been proven to have been based on finding bones of a badly arthritic Neanderthal remains....and egocentric thinking on their part. Most all modern humans with European backgrounds carry up to about 3% Neanderthal DNA. They took care of their elders and the sick, and buried their children. And survived about 300,000 years I believe. But I know the point you are making and mostly I agree with you.\n\nNeuroplasticity seems to happen when one is exposed to new ideas, new events, and nurturing. The problem with conservatives and the people you are referring to is that their brain makes it harder for them to embrace new things....they fear new things. So they aren't exposed to many foreigners, don't let science in their thought process.....and seem to hate facts of any kind. They don't like to be challenged or having to change their opinions.\n\nBut although maybe rare, it does happen. Before I moved to England in the early 80's, I was a conservative. My family were all conservatives for the most part. Then my kids went to British schools, I made friends, and somehow ended up with pen pals from over 10 other nations and was exposed to a whole bunch of new data that challenged my thinking. I went back to college and took critical thinking and many other classes that made me have to research issues in order to write essays required to pass my classes. All of this forced my brain to move from being conservative to being more liberal.\n\nThe GOP leadership understands this, even if they have no idea why it happens.....Rick Santorum as well as Mitt Romney both said that we shouldn't send our kids to college because education makes them more liberal....one said something about makes them think for themselves.  The 2010 GOP platform from Texas listed removing critical thinking from class rooms because it made kids more likely to think for themselves....\n\nThen there was a conservative who attended a conservative town hall meeting. He said that he had been opposed to the ACA....right up until it saved his life.....that illness forced his brain to see a bigger picture. I agree with you, it doesn't happen often, but if we understand how the brain works, we might find a way to frame things so that a conservative brain can listen. In fact, somewhere online I saw an article discussing that possibility.....but the part of my brain still too conservative got angry and it shut down my ability to hear that message and I turned the computer off. Later I couldn't find the article again. We are all a work in progress......smiles\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nNo you did.. lotsa of it.. \n\nYou are holy and you can not vote for least  evil.. ya right..
