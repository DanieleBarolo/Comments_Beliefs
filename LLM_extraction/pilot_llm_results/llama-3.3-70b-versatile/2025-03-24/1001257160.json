  "parent_text": "Why is the NAACP involved?  \nThis is not about Race!   Besides\nthat, Obama is half White, Why not call him White?   I hope this clown makes millions suing the\nNAACP, and all racist organizations involved. \nAnyone in their right mind knows that these clowns are hero\u2019s These\nRodeo Clowns  save the lives of Cowboys\nthat fall off the ride, and risk their own to do it.  This is a shameful example of our lost\nfreedom!!!!!   The clowns are in charge of the NAACP!",
