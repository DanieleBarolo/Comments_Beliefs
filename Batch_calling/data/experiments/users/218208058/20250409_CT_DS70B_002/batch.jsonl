Regarding Western Europe: There are reasons that health care costs less in Western Europe. I would rather not go down this rat hole. Let me  say this: Western Europe does not suffer  the artificial  shortage  of health-care providers that the American public has endured for generations; pharmacists and nurses play a greater role  in the health  care systems of Western Europe (or, so I've read). And doctors tend to make less money.\nThe VA has rationed  health care for decades. It's not the worst system  in  the world, but this doesn't square with your theory.\nIn the US, putting Medicare in a strong bargaining position means that the medical lobby controls both parties. I don't think we should lose sight of  this.

Just wondering. You seem to be under the impression that people in custody are not being documented. Should we take photographs and fingerprints of children? Retina scans? DNA? Are we obligated to verify the DNA of someone claiming to be related to a child? \nAnd, seriously, what do you propose that we do with the 90% of children who were  not accompanied by any adult? Think we should send them back to their home? Does that meet your standard of humane treatment? \nChildren in Latin America, particularly among the poor, aren't exactly treated the same way as they are in the United States.  The children who are here aren't exactly  'runaways'.  And the parents who drag their young children along with them across the border... I think  they have questionable judgment. \nMaybe the real question is How many immigrants should we accept, and Who decides?\nYou seem to find comfort in arguing against the inhumane treatment of children. I think we treat children quite humanely, personally.  We provide housing, food, water, plumbing, and supervision. I believe we provide a degree of health care. But some people think that 'separation' is inhumane. This has absolutely NOTHING to do with 90% of the children in custody, but, what the heck -- it makes for great political tripe, doesn't it?  Of all the issues to focus on, you've chosen one  that involves a very small number  of children, which just so happens to serve your political agenda. This is the true discussion, whether you admit it or not.\nYour blame of the Trump Administration speaks volumes.  How timely and convenient for you! What a great opportunity for virtue-signaling! YOU SUPPORT THE CHILDREN! How enlightened! If what I am saying is true, and you are merely virtue-signaling, and blaming the Trump Administration, despite the fact that this problem  existed long before Trump entered the political arena, then what does that say about you? \n\"What to do next?\" is the central question here. You don't know. Maybe 'civil conversation' will solve the problems. History, and I think you might want to consider pre-Trump history,  just for perspective, suggests otherwise.\nWhat to do about the failed narco-state to the south? I think we have enough problems of our own, and Mexicans will have to assume responsibility for Mexico. We can support orphanages, and build houses for the poor - which my church does every year -- but the culture is a disaster, and there is very  little Americans can do to fundamentally transform Mexican society.  From what I've learned, if you don't rescue the  kids before the age of 12 (okay, maybe 10...), they're  lost forever -- not matter what you try. These are the facts on the ground.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Did you forget?  Fortune cookie say, \"You no make sense!\"\nRevised procedures for asylum-seekers, revision to 'birthright citizenship' as it relates to illegal border crossers and maternity  tourism, enhanced presence on the border, including more agents and surveillance tech, challenges to 'sanctuary cities' as well as states,  end to the 'visa lottery', with merit-based immigration policies...\nMaybe you didn't hear that the Border Patrol requested a revision, using a see-through barrier? Did you miss this, too? You're still blabbing about concrete! How is this possible? \nYou can't credibly claim ignorance of this. But you did! You're not serious, or credible.\nDude, you see what you believe! Get it? You don't see what you don't believe.  Trump is a 'con' (such a clever double-entendre...), low-brow Breitbart readers are driven by fear. This is so classic! You don't get it, and maybe you never  will!  (Are you south  of 20? If so, there's still hope! If you're north of 30, the odds are against you.)\nHave you seen the video clips of Schumer, HRC, and Barack O (among countless others) advocating for a barrier at the border? Now it's all about  Trump! (And, and, and... He doesn't care!)  Wow! You are a special case. Other Presidents have kicked the can down the road. \nWe'll see how it plays out. The partisan loons, such as ML,  will squawk no matter what. Immigration reform should be bipartisan.  I think the smart money is on the status quo, but stay tuned!

Bloomberg turned the family friendly city that Giuliani created back into the Freak Peep Shows of the 1970s 42nd Street. Bloomberg is a corrupt pervert. He also allowed Occupy Wall Street to camp out in a park and run rampant in NYC for nine to ten months.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nBlacks and Hispanics typically commit 90-95% of all murders in NYC.

Obama implemented this in Houston. I had lived 5 yrs in an upscale gated apt. community in N.Houston suburbs, nestled together with 3 other similar communities. They clear-cut the surrounding greenspace and put in an apt. community that was really nice housing .. comparable to the others... except it was subsidized; if you make over $25,000 year you could not live there. Within 4 months we had 4 rapes on OUR property, innumerable break-ins and then gunshots ... during the day. The apt below me was a cop .. and he came out one morning and his pick-up was up on blocks.. all 4 tires, wheels, wheelcovers, etc. were gone. All the pool furniture was gone (they replaced it twice and then gave up). I was out after the truck incident and by then ... that area .. that <u>WHOLE area is a slum</u>, including the new Obama community ... as well as the communities that were quite nice to live in before those were built.... trash in the streets, paint peeling off the buildings, gutters hanging half-off ... screens punched through and half-hanging off the windows... landscaping worn down to bare grass .... along with the uptick in violent crime ... so very, very sad.\n\nOur cops couldn't keep up....we went from upscale to slum in 6 months -- and its still like that (10+ year later .. it never recovered).   Simply put ... the suburbs will look like .... slums ... your tax dollars at work.\n\nOn the bright side ... the elusive voter for Trump... the veritable unicorn... has been described as suburban white women ... well  somehow I think they might become Trump voters once they get a whiff of what Biden has in store for their own suburban neighborhoods, kid's schools, soccer teams, piano lessons, gymnastics, etc. etc....and not to mention their property values.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nA de facto declaration of war against suburban communities.

But don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that big regulation and huge investment capital is an advantage to the largest firms, and limits exposure to competition. It\u2019s not entirely innocent.\n\nWe could implement policies that encourage competition and reduce the investment required. Guess who is opposed to such policies? We could also expand the supply of health- care professionals. Do you remember \u2018supply-side economics\u2019?\n\n Ask any Congressman, in private, how this works. \n\nReforming Big Pharma, or anything medical, is the kiss of death.

Anyway, you will find opportunities to cite published papers that confirm your political bias, if that makes you feel better. Note how the Chamber of Commerce-types support immigration, as does Wall Street, and global corporations \u2014 who benefit from it.

This is, in fact, an example of the Rule of Men as opposed to the Rule of Law.  Worst decision in 50 years, regardless of what you think about abortion.\n\nMaybe the Rule of Law will be  re-established. People can vote, and their representatives can use the legislative process, to establish public policy regarding abortion. This is an exception  to the tendency away from the Rule of Law.  And it hasn't happened yet, so don't get carried away.\n\nThe American Experiment is the experiment in self-government. It's not going so well at the moment. You know, the money supply was inflated at a truly astonishing rate in the vicinity of 40%. This has devalued our currency. This has impacted the middle- and working-class in a big way. Did you vote for this?  I suggest that there is NOTHING you, or your elected representatives, can do about this.  This is not the Rule of Law. We are being ruled by men.

Long enough to remember the 'Big Pause', which flipped the script from global warming to 'climate change'? Long enough to realize that the baseline of '79, the year that weather satellites began recording data, was somewhat misleading? \n\nTell me, Ronald, from your Enlightened scientific perspective, is there an optimal global temperature? If you were in absolute control of the global climate,  as the Climate God, would you lower the temperature? If so, how much, and,  why? And would you keep the global temperature unchanged?

Those crazy narratives running circles in your head are confusing you! \n\nYes, i do believe that the people working at the border are a very good source for practical information.  Border towns. They have an informed perspective, much more than a partisan professor working for the Open Society, for example. \n\nDELUSION: You assumed that I harbor hatred for poor immigrants seeking a better life. That nutty hatred is ALL IN YOUR HEAD. That is a delusion, a self-serving, irrational delusion. FACT! Deal with it! And that fact that you need an explanation reflects your incoherence.

What a silly young person you are! Leave this topic to the adults.
