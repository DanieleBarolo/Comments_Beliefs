And I fail to see how giving seniors medical care is tyranny but right wing ideologues spot a lot of looney crap. Seniors will never give up medicare and are unaffected by Obamacare. The 700 billion that was cut was not a cut from their benefits and was cut from redundancy and waste. Look, wake up and realize there never was and never will be a libertarian utopia. Notice no one has ever tried either? I wonder why? All states, even the one's calling themselves communist(which should be a big clue) are now a mix of capitalism and what you would call socialism.

The War on Drugs is the greatest policy failure in American history and is a disaster no matter how you slice it. The fact that we continue it when it does nothing to stop drug use or sales is the definition of insanity. And for Klukowski to say that it's \"the far left\" that has been pushing decriminalization is totally false. Libertarians on the right have been pushing for drug decriminalization too. The federal government does not own you body and therefore has no legal right to tell you what you can and can't put in it nor should it be in the business of legislating morality or personal choices. How can anyone claim they are for small government yet want to control personal behavior and then jail someone for a personal decision that effects only the individual? And when did drugs become a moral issue and abstaining become a part of \"traditional morality\"? When the government said so about 40 years ago?

We can also show how the outsourcing of jobs started under Reagan and his fight against labor, even though he needed the Teamsters to get elected, lead to lower wages and the disappearance of the manufacturing base that built this country. That's also responsible for the death of the black community, many of whom relied on factory jobs to support themselves and their families, the shrinking of the middle class, and the massive wealth gap we now have. Reagan's war on drugs is undoubtedly one of the largest policy failures in American history and lead to the US having a prison population larger than Russia an China combined and the creation of a defacto police state.

There's always a mix between union and non-union help on a job, even if it requires a kickback on the part of the contractors to make it happen. My Uncle was a union big and I worked many summers of construction when I was young so know all about this. There will be numerous bids for parts as always and the company closest to the political class(or the labor union), as always, will win. That doesn't hold up business. It's how it runs. There is nothing more environmentally friendly than rail since it runs on electricity(!) and hence there will be no opposition to it.

Basically what you're saying is that the whole series is a bust because you're a prig, and probably a failed actor, who doesn't agree  a tv characters moral choice? Did you ever think that the writers are aware that the lead character is a loser and that's why he made such a decision? I think that idea has been explored throughout the series, especially since a huge motivator for him, and part of his back story, is that he was a brilliant chemist who because of one reason or another blew his potential, sold a piece of his start-up and wound up losing billions of dollars and great power. It's that gnawing sense of regret and where his life wound up that can turn a person bad. But see, you wouldn't know any of those details because you don't watch the show and instead are making bad judgments based on what? A synopsis? get lost, loser.

LOL! \n\nYou're seriously asking me that question? Obviously you don't grasp the word irony because the answer is YOU! LMAO! You're a social conservative for christ sakes! A theorcracy in America is your dream! You even go so far as to say hispanics are going to vote their religion(biggest loser RW talking point there is, especially when recently polled they are voting as a majority toward democrats and if you didn't notice did in the last election too)over the fact that the GOP has always been an anti-immigrant, xenophobic party. The one thing the GOP was hoping to do to bring in Latino votes was push immigration reform and you guys are against that, especially TED CRUZ! It's your wet dream to believe that 76% of hispanics are suddenly going to turn tail and vote for Ted Cruz because he's hispanic and for their religion especially when he opposes the immigration platform! Should also add that large swathes of latino immigrants are low wage workers and you really think they're going to vote for a party that opposes minimum wage and minimum wage hikes because of homosexuals? You're just projecting your twisted, infantile fear and hatred on to others. Most Christians, especially Catholics, which is what most latino's are, have little issue with gay people and believe in the Church's teachings about social justice making them far more left than right. It's baptists and Wasps that vote Republican majorities not Catholics. Amazing too that conservatives hate identity politics but now think they will work for them! HYPOCRITE! No, hispanics vote democrat because the DNC is a more working class party and friendlier toward immigrants. And you went on and on about how liberal feared conservatism's last darling, Sarah Palin too, and what happened to her? NOTHING. Cruz will wind up the same way and will never be anything but a local phenom. He knows this too and is just working the Ted Cruz brand for the fame and the money. Of course you dupes believe otherwise. \n\nAccording to all actual polling Christie is the GOP front runner. You don't understand this because you live in a right wing bubble that is obsessed with ideological purity and thinks that's whats going to win even though that's why you lost in 2012 according to the GOP autopsy report and all exit polling. The majority of republicans in this country are moderates, not TP imbeciles. And no, I don't \"persecute\" christians, you half wit, but I'll definitely ridicule you since anyone with half a brain knows God is a human invention, hence your morality is not divine and now reflects nothing but your infantile fear of the other. It was the hard opposition to abortion and gays that hurt you guys in 2012 but like mental cases you'll just double down on a losing tactic and blame everyone else(media, Romney, fraud) for why you lost. \n\nAnd I don't give a good crap about Leon Trotsky. The name was picked to provoke you and it did like the reactionary, Pavlovian dog you are. There is no communism anymore and even Mao's China and Vietnam have become capitalists.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

Atlas Shrugs Part 1 and 2. And if based on right wing reasoning, that the box office that a film does has a corollary with it's political message then we can take away that conservatism, especially Ayn Rand's version, is a spectacular failure and been completely rejected. Then again that bears out in the real world as evidenced by last years primaries and the rejection of hard right candidates for moderates. In any case, Elysium came in exactly as projected last week and had a huge purchase of it's commercial TV rights to FX. So with that in mind and the 44 million dollar take it had worldwide in it's first week I'd say it's right on schedule to make a decent profit for Sony. A \"flop\" is After Earth and the Lone Ranger, films that haven't even come close to recouping their budgets and are poorly reviewed. Elysium still holds a 60 plus percent tomato score too. What was Atlas Shrugs? Like 7%? Might have even been lower because the film is such an unwatchable, self righteous, inane piece of crap whose ideology only a sociopath could embrace.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.

Do they not know how to write a standard drama or comedy? Liberal filmmakers don't make nothing but politically liberal films. This is what's ironic: you all moan and groan about the occasional politically themed film Hollywood makes like Elysium. even though there is a precedent for politically tinged sci-fi going back decades that has always been a bit left, and then when you make your own films they are ALL promoting a political agenda! You guys should have worked for the Soviet film industry but even they weren't this ideological after the era of Stalin and put out challenging films by Tarkovsky that had strong spiritual and moral themes. In any case, this story sounds like absolute rubbish and will play only to the conservative die hard's who are mainly interested in promoting right wing politics but everyone else will ignore it much like they did with Atlas Shrugs and whatever other forgotten \"conservative movie\" came out.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    1.
