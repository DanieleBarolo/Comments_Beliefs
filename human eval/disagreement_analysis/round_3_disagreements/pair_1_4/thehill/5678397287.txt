It's bad enough when foreign enemies attack America.


It's even worse when Americans attack America, like the MAGAts did on January 6th.

Garland's speech yesterday and President Biden labelin' Trump as the undisputed leader of the #January6th attack sounds like a one-two punch kickin' off 2022 as the year of accountability for those who sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
