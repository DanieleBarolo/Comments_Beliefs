You can't credibly argue that it's illegal \"because,\" when the words strongly suggest that it is. \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nHere's a question to those supporting it from a Republican who thinks the current strategy of my compatriots is misguided:\n\nEveryone thinks this will be a one-off thing.\u00a0 What happens when the debt ceiling has to be raised AGAIN before the midterm elections or shortly thereafter, when Republicans are still likely to be in control of the house.\n\nSo they mint the coin, endure a lot of blowback, and the crazy wing of the GOP is able to say \"you see, Obama really is that dangerous!\"\u00a0 republicans become LESS likely to compromise, not more.\u00a0 Meanwhile, markets spook, people stop trusting American debt (trying to distinguish between executive and congressional debt will confuse markets, 14th amendment notwithstanding) and the partisan rancor is elevated to even higher levels.\n\nIf republicans are as vile as the minters claim, what makes you think they will change when we have to do this again, especially when, thanks to redistricting, Repubs are still odds on favorite to control the House?\n\nIn short, what's the freakin endgame?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Police\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
