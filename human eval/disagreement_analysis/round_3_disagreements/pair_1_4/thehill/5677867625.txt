Garland's speech yesterday and President Biden labelin' Trump as the undisputed leader of the #January6th attack sounds like a one-two punch kickin' off 2022 as the year of accountability for those who sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

7/1/21:

- FBI deletes Epps from FBI data base
- no indictment, no arrest, no explanation

Hmmm...
