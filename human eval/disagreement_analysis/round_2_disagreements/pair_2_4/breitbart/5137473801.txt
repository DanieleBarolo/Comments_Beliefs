Barr and Durham ran out the clock. Had they "found something" and prosecuted, Fake News would have been forced to report on it, and could not have pulled their black curtain of silence around it.
I wonder how many people voted without knowing that Biden was an influence-peddling crook? No laptop, no bagman Hunter, none of it being known if one only read newspapers and watched network TV news.

The MSM is making Trump seem like the underdog, and biden the expected winner. Its the same fake leftwing narrative they used in 2016 all over again...truly shameless propaganda...
...
Please say a Prayer for Trump, and the Victory for the American people on election day, with another 4 years of Trump as POTUS, and The Senate and House under Republican control.

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come;
thy will be done;
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.

GET OUT AND VOTE PATRIOTS!!!

PARENT COMMENT:
There was a reason they kept Biden in the basement during the entire election. They knew the fix was in. They kept saying Trump might be declared the winner until the mail in ballots were counted. They knew how it was going to play out. They knew how hard it is to remove an incumbent President with great poll numbers on the economy. We had 4 years to prepare for the dem cheating and <i>failed </i>to stop it. Now we know why Barr and Durham dragged their feet they knew the fix was in. Remember we were supposed to get the Durham findings late spring, then late summer, then early fall then after the election. They were simply running interference.
