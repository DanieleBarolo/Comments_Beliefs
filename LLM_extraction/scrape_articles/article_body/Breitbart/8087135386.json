He is now drinking water with one hand. He says the media gave him another disease after West Point. Crowd is chanting “Trump! Trump!” after he sipped water.8:42 PM: Trump babbling about walking down the West Point ramp. He apparently has never heard of Barbara Streisand.He is now mimicking his walk and says he didn’t like the fact that he was “bent over” and says his opponents will use the image in ads. Trump says he looked “very handsome” while walking down the ramp and didn’t want to fall in front of the media.NYT’s Haberman having fun with this rally:8:32 PM: Trump now says: “Let’s open the schools, please.” He says “we gotta get them open” in the fall.Now he says the unhinged left-wing mob is trying to desecrate history, tear down statues, and cancel and punish anyone who does not absolutely conform to their agenda.

Trump says these people are “stone-cold crazy.”Trump says vote for him “if you want to save our heritage” and says “you’re so lucky I’m your president.”8:27 PM: Trump now mocking Seattle for allowing an autonomous zone. Trump says it’s probably better to just “watch that disaster” in liberal areas like Seattle instead of “straightening it out fast.” Trump says it’s better to “let it simmer” for a little bit to see what the “left-wing radicals” will do to the country. He talks about left-wing radicals rioting, looting, burning down buildings, and injuring police officers and thousands of people only to hear the fake news say “what a beautiful rally it was.”Trump says the fake news media never talk about “Covid” when tens of thousands of protesters march in cities and loot. He says the press never talks about “Covid-19” and “masks” and, desperately craving an applause line, Trump says it gets further and further away from China and the “Chinese virus.” Like a wrestler now competing for lower-tier titles, not getting his usual pop, and throwing every gimmick up against the wall to get the pop he once got.8:26 PM: Trump says the protesters outside are “thugs” and not “wonderful” like “the Boston Tea Party.” Trump says the fake news media are trying to insist that the protesters are “peaceful.”8;25 PM: Trump says if AOC is in charge of energy, it will make the “pandemic look like child’s play….”8:20 PM: Trump says he never knew the D.C. swamp was so bad.
