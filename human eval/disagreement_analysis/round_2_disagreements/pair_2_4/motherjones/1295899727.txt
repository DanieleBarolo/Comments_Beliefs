Is Hobby Lobby contemplating applying for tax free status as a religious organization? If they are, then they can quit being a outlet store for all the cheap crap from Communist China and convert their stores to churches. If not, then they are just another profit motivated retail giant looking to cut overhead by denying coverage.

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.
