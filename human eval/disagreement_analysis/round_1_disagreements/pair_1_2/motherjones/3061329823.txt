what is shown above is that you have nothing but hatred and bigotry for anyone who does not do exactly as you, nor believes exactly as you do, as shown above by you(and in hundreds of other places within the Mother Jones Comment sections).

We need to get our representatives to explain to their constituents that there was Russian hacking, and yes, it did compromise the election, and, yes, it did skew the election to t rump.  When will it become a given that states with the easiest voting process have the most progressive congressional delegations.  I fear that there is a movement afoot by conservatives to instigate easily detectable fraud in a state with mail in ballots in order to say, " see! see! Making voting easier makes fraud easier."  .

"The Tea Party's ideas were wrong and their behavior was often horrible....We are better than this."

As they used to say on Mythbusters......"Well there's your problem." If we (should have) learned anything from this most recent electoral debacle it's that taking the high road landed us smack in a political ditch from which it may take years or even decades to extricate ourselves. We got Trumped, Bannoned, Comeyed, Putined and in every way imaginable screwed six ways from Sunday by the nastiest campaign of white-is-right fear and loathing since George Wallace.

The only way to stop Trumpism is take the gloves off and get down in the mud with the plug-uglies on the uber right, and that poses a yuge problem because far too many younger voters, who represent the future of the liberal/progressive/independent movement, were already disengaged because they felt that the whole political process was irretrievably corrupted by "the boomers" and was not something they wanted to soil themselves by participating in. The "conservatives" knew that and used it to their advantage. 

Clearly, Trump's strategy was to be so nasty and so crazy-like-a-fox.....to lie constantly on a level that can only be described as a pathological Gish Gallop for the ages, that he'd depress voter turnout on the left. And it worked in large part because:

(1) The allegedly liberal MSM refused to go after him  until it was much too late, 
(2) The right wing media celebrated the Gallop instead of excoriating it, 
(3) The FBI refused to go after Trump's campaign for its ties to Russia and instead joined in the Clinton-bashing, and
(4) Most of all, too many voters on the left bought into his campaign of slander and character assassination and decided that Hillary Clinton just wasn't trustworthy enough to deserve their votes in spite of repeated warnings that a protest vote or an abstention could lead to exactly the kind of sociocultural and environmental calamity we're facing today. 

Republicans need to be hammered relentlessly for their continued willingness to sell out to the corporate greed, Christian extremism, rampant homophobia, militant misogyny and racist filth that are now the hallmarks of Trumpism. There are 686 days until election day in 2018, but the decision to abandon the high road and prepare to get the proverbial hair mussed needs to come today or nothing is going to change. Trump has lowered the bar and it's going to stay low from now on. That's an ugly truth but in politics as in all things, "why fix something that works?"

    Unless your morals require you to do whatever you can to prevent the greater evil, which yours obviously don't.

      but in pursuing the lesser evils, you enable the greater, just not with as much alacrity.

        I'm not going to have the same, pointless circular exchange with you tonight that we had last night. You don't give a flying fuck about the things that I and tens of millions of other Americans believe in, care about and have fought for over the last half century.

          funny, given that your argument that you fight for such things is countered by your unwavering support of a candidate who wouldnt fight for those things if it hindered her pursuit of political power.


anyways, if you dont want to think, you dont have to.  if you dont want to figure out how you failed in convincing me that I should support a candidate that did not really believe as you* or I do, thats your choice to make.

*assuming you arent actually lying about what you believe
