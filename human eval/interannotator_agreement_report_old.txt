OVERALL METRICS
------------------------------
Average topics marked per comment by first annotator: 1.67

modified_jaccard_score: 97.64%
f1_score: 60.07%

topic_direction_agreement: 87.44%

COMPARISON OF METRICS
------------------------------
* Basic Coverage Rate (pooled): Percentage of all possible topics that both annotators provided values for
  - Calculated by pooling all comments together, then dividing
  - Gives more weight to comments with more annotated topics

* Basic Directional Rate (pooled): Among topics both annotated, percentage with directional agreement
  - Calculated by pooling all comments together, then dividing
  - Gives more weight to comments with more shared annotations

* Standard Jaccard Score: Intersection over union of topics marked by either annotator
  - Calculated per-comment, then averaged
  - Gives equal weight to each comment regardless of topic count

* Modified Jaccard Score: Agreement counting both mutual annotations and mutual NaN values
  - Calculated per-comment, then averaged
  - Considers agreement on NOT annotating a topic as a form of agreement

* F1 Score: Balances precision and recall for topic selection
  - Calculated per-comment, then averaged
  - Treats topic selection as a binary classification task

* Topic Selection Agreement: Agreement on which topics to annotate (same as Jaccard)
  - Calculated per-comment, then averaged
  - Focuses only on which topics were selected, not how they were annotated

* Topic Direction Agreement: Agreement on direction for mutually annotated topics
  - Calculated per-comment, then averaged
  - Only considers topics that both annotators marked
  - Treats E+/I+ as the same direction, E-/I- as the same direction

WHY METRICS DIFFER
------------------------------
The key reason 'Basic Directional Rate' and 'Topic Direction Agreement' differ is the method of aggregation:

1. Basic Directional Rate pools all topics across all comments, then calculates a single percentage.
   - This gives more weight to comments with more shared annotations

2. Topic Direction Agreement calculates a percentage for each comment, then averages these percentages.
   - This gives equal weight to each comment regardless of how many topics were shared

Example to illustrate:
- Comment 1: 2 out of 2 shared topics have direction agreement (100%)
- Comment 2: 1 out of 10 shared topics have direction agreement (10%)

Basic Directional Rate: (2+1)/(2+10) = 3/12 = 25%
Topic Direction Agreement: (100% + 10%)/2 = 55%

WHICH METRICS TO USE
------------------------------
* If you care more about overall annotation quality across all topics: Use Modified Jaccard
* If you want to separate 'which topics to annotate' from 'how to annotate them': 
  - For topic selection: Use Standard Jaccard or Topic Selection Agreement
  - For direction assignment: Use Topic Direction Agreement
* For comparing with other annotation projects: Use F1 Score
* If you care more about comments with many annotations: Use Basic Directional Rate
* If you care equally about all comments: Use Topic Direction Agreement
