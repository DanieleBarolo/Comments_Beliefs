Some have resorted to doing their business on theflooror outdoors, others have used showers, and many migrants\u00a0will have never seen toilet paper before.The issue caused some serious confusion last year, with one small German village beingaccused of racismafter issuing leaflets politely asking migrants to use to the correct facilities.With 1.5 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa arriving in the country last year, solving the problem without facing such accusations of bigotry presents a sizeable business opportunity.Enter the Global Fliegenschmidt toilet manufacturers based in Coswig, Saxony-Anhalt, who have announced their plans to develop a mobile \u201cmulticultural toilet\u201d complete with a squatting platform and water hose for migrant\u00a0friendly sanitation.The design was shown\u00a0to theFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungnational newspaper, who gave a gloriously politically correctwrite upof the new product, branding it, \u201cUniversally applicable: the refugee toilet is ideal for the globalised defecation.\u201d\u201cBecause everyone knows: Different cultures also mean different scale latrines. For Muslims, it is important that when using a toilet, one\u2019s back does not face Mecca. In addition, latrines for men and women have to separate from each other, and the floor cannot be green in colour, because that is the colour of Islam\u201d, reads their report.The article describes refugees standing on toilet bowls and breaking them, and some who resort to defecating in bushes.\u201cGerman toilets are a mystery to many refugees and this has already led to problems. A new mobile multicultural toilet should remedy this\u2014and along the way teach something about the coexistence of cultures\u201d, declares the article.In concludes: \u201cAnd so, as the refugees have brought about many changes in German society solely by their presence\u2026 so is it now with the toilet in the future with this pressing issue.\u201cWith some justification, one could say: Here we can even learn something from the refugees.\u201d\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nStop feeding them.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022God\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022California\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Terrorism\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The terrorists\u00a0surfaced from the forests in which they were hiding \u201cbegging for food,\u201d one witness stated, having chosen surrender over starvation.The surrender occurred in the town of Gwoza, previously the scene of a Boko Haram massacre,the Associated Press reports. The men leading the group, which included women and child hostages, demanded to be fed in exchange for surrender, according to both a Nigerian soldier who could not be named and a civilian self-defense group representative. The Boko Haram terrorists allegedly told soldiers that there were many like themselves hiding in Borno state\u2019s Sambisa forest, home base for the Islamic State-affiliated terror organization, hoping to surrender in exchange for being fed.Nigerian news outlet Naijpublished a photothey claim is of the surrendering group.The mass surrender follows a similar incident in which Nigerian soldiers arrested a number of high-ranking Boko Haram members who appeared to be attempting to travel south, out of the typical range of action for the terrorist group. On Monday, the Civilian Joint Task Force assigned to assist the military in attacking Boko Haram in areas that are less accessible to the federal governmentannounced that they had arrestedfour suspected Boko Haram members in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno. \u201cThe suspects looked unkempt with signs of starvation and have been handed over to the military for further interrogation,\u201d according to Nigeria\u2019sDaily Post.All four were members of Nigeria\u2019stop 100 most wanted terrorist list, and were identified through tattoos they bore of Boko Haram symbols.The next day, Nigerian military spokesmen announced that four men had been arrested in relation to a church bombing near the capital, Abuja, conducted five years ago. The bombing has been attributed to the Boko Haram group and the men are believed to be members. One man, identified as Victor Moses,was arrestedafter lurking around a local mosque, claiming he was a Christian looking to convert. Authorities believe Moses was conducting surveillance to give Boko Haram jihadists the information necessary to bomb the mosque. Moses has confessed to this crime.The Associated Press notes that the Nigerian military is taking these arrests as evidence that their tactics against Boko Haram are working, particularly their attempts to cordon off the Sambisa forest and prevent those hiding within from acquiring food, fuel, or weapons. \u201cIn essence, the insurgents have been effectively denied territory or sanctuary and are now in disarray\u2026 Scattered, demoralized and hungry, they have resorted to terror tactics available to a degraded and defeated insurgent group,\u201d Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s Information Minister, said in February.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has already declared victory against Boko Haram, despite their continued ability to stage suicide bombings and village raids. \u201cTechnically, we have won the war,\u201d Buharisaid in Decemberin a BBC Hausa interview.\u00a0\u201cBoko Haram has been systematically decimated and are in no position to cause serious threat to our development programmes,\u201d hereiterated last monthat a meeting with the Emir of Qatar. Many doubt Buhari\u2019s confidence, however, as Boko Haram has staged numerous attacks between December and March, including the massacre of dozens in the village of Dalori, Borno.Nigeria has become an increasingly inhospitable country for its Christians,according to a report released in February. Up to 11,500 Christians have been killed and more than one million displaced in the past 16 years, and 13,000 churches have been destroyed.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nServe them pork chops.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022God\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022California\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022The press\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Terrorism\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}
