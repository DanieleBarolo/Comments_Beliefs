The worst part of this entire situation is we have the house, senate and whitehouse and Schumer and Pelosi are running the country...which proves we don't have a two party system, rather they are all in on it together screwing you me and everyone.

PARENT COMMENT:
He sounds like a liberal democrat just repeating the same sh t they say. There are only like 300 dreamers out of 800k serving in the military. It was a dumb excuse when liberals used even dumber when Trump does. We aren't getting a wall, he's giving amnesty WTF?
