I have a feeling this was his plans all along; he just wanted to see if he could win the presidency to boost his big ego. That's what he does in his life, win a 'deal' and move on. I don't  think he was planning of running for a second term.

    IF this is true that Trump is in favor of the Dream Act, in direct violation of his repeated promises, THEN PATRIOTS IT IS TIME TO TREAT TRUMP THE SAME WAY WE TREATED OBAMA.  WE WILL FIGHT HIM, MAKE HIM A ONE TERM FAILURE, AND GO TO ALL OUT POLITICAL WAR AGAINST THE FILTHY FAT ****!!  Get on the phones tomorrow to the White House and every member of Congress and scream your absolute HELL NO to amnesty to them!

          Whether it's true or not, Trump is impatient and in politics that's a huge mistake, especially dealing with Democrats. He doesn't know their real end game. If he signs on to DACA, he's done! I'll wait and see if he does...

            I can reconcile Trump caving on virtually any issue, Amnesty and not building the wall are not one of them. F a GD tax cut, build the GD wall NOW and kill all this lawless Amnesty talk. Sick of it. Do the job people elected you to do...

                No amnesty
.
Trump: if you cave on this, the people who call you an orange racist women hating tax cheat n-a-z-i, will still hate you.
.
The only difference is most of your biggest supporters (myself 1st in line) will also hate you.

                  Trump attempting to play the "amnesty dealer" Reagan got duped by it,  Bush 43 tried to play the "compassionate conservative" and they still raked him over the coals so much that (blame bush) became a campaign slogan.  President Trump must have some really poor students of political history around him.  There will be cartoons of DJT reading newspapers in the oval office confused and frustrated that they still hate him.

In his tweets this morning he says, no "deal" was made then goes on to sell the "deal" with more tweets.  Claims wall is being built but Ryan and McConnel say no.  No matter what massive border security you throw at it, its still swiss cheese without a wall.  That surveillance may detect but with no wall it doesn't stop the invasion from coming in.  High tech border security has bureaucrats at the levers.  Bureaucrats can be bribed.  The excuse is they're "educated" so we cannot throw them out!  Educated by the public school system in the USA?  Thats WORSE!  They've been even more indoctrinated to hate America.  Our education system is the reason not to bring in children. They will become card carrying marxists and have no skills.  Then they will be given slots at the colleges existing Citizens were applying for, while the Citizens children get passed over.

TRUMPS MORNING AFTER THE DACA DINNER TWEETS...
"please clap"  "guac bowls for sale"  "act of love"

                    Ivanka and Jared are his top advisors and they are democrats.  Put a fork in Trump.  He is done.
