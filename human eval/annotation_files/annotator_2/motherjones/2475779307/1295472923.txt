  I wonder what would happen if Hobby Lobby would need to make a religious decision that would cost them a lot of money. Would they still insist on following their religious rules then?

    Lydia - Good point! When its put that way, profits and corporate survival verses bible interpretation, the choice becomes more difficult. We can be assured that had Hobby Lobby been owned by liberal Democrats instead of conservative Republicans there would be no case. There is no doubt that politics plays the major role.

      Can a liberal democrat be religious? If so, what religion would be acceptable?

        "<i>...what religion would be acceptable?</i>"


The kind that tosses Christine O'Donnell in the river to see if she floats.
