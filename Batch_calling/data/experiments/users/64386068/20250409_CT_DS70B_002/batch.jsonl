It was all about how you could not have a place to live, or be able to purchase food unless you were approved by the beast. It was always implied the beast was something that controlled the reigns of government. I by and large discounted it, it was just a preacher working the crowd up. Now days I am not so sure.\n\n\nThe government is involved with a lot things in our lives. Examples how to rent property, how to hire, even who to hire, increasingly what to say, medical, and now the performance of our livelihood. Scary when you think about it and New Mexico is not the only state doing this.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022China\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Why didn't we in the 1870's with the advent of the Franco-Prussian War? When Prussia invaded and overthrew the French government and a unified Germany was the result. After all Prussian militarism is often given as a cause for World War One.

I have a question for you Johnny Boy. If amnesty is such a winner for the GOP, why did you table it until after the election? Be a man of conviction for once in your miserable life, vote for it now! Let your supporters see where your true allegiance lie. I also ask this to the people out there, why do you continue to vote for the Republican Party? \n\nYou are not accomplishing anything. The GOP despises you, they may mouth comforting words to placate you. In the end they are just as much elitist as any Democrat. Take today for an example the so called opposition party fully funded Obamacare and authorized Obama to arm the so called moderate Muslims in Syria. Which really means ISIS and Al Qaeda and your children will eventually have to go back and deal with them, again.

It is a senatorial rule not a constitutional requirement. They could just change the rule. The fact they don't proves they never much wanted to in the first place. \n\n\n\nNo matter what Obama does the Republican Party will never stop him. They refuse to entertain an impeachment proceeding against him. The one thing they can do short of impeachment is not approve his funding demands.\n\n\nThey simply refuse to defund a thing that Obama wants. The House controls the purse. Notice not once has Speaker John Boehner and the GOP failed to fully fund an Obama program. Though, they gained control of the House in order to stop Obamacare in 2010. Five years later Obamacare is still fully funded and the law of the land.\n\n\nDid you believe congress would stop Obama on this? Soon they will be like the old Roman senate in the mid to late empire. Caesar would call the senate into session. They would rubber stamp what ever Caesar wanted to be done. Then vote Caesar a new honor or accolade and go home.  \n\n\n\nAs for the Republican Party their future is reflected by California after allowing this amnesty.

Still they all sent their children to all the approved Party schools and made sure those children performed all the required Party functions.

Thus ensuring that child's future in the Soviet state. \n\n\n\nThat's all that is going on here.

We wont have this time again in our lives to call Senators, Congressmen and women, and hidden government cronies before the voters, and world to have their life time of evil deeds, and current evil goals, exposed to all, and their careers ruined.\n\nWe have been abused by our government leaders, the federal policing agencies, and an unlimited supply of media henchmen.   This is the best and perhaps only real opportunity we will ever have to expose them.\n\nEven now, people supposedly on the right, but doing the bidding of big government, are talking, saying let's not have a trial. Perino, Grassely, etc.\n\nRemember, Pelosi not sending the articles to the Senate, is a plan the Rinos and libs hatched together, stalling time to talk, explain away, and lie, to stop a Senate trial that will expose them all.\n\nStay strong Patriots, Put these clowns on trial, while vindicating Trump more than imaginable.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nHow is this woman still a democrat?

This report on contagious agents is also a little out of alignment. Shutting down basically all transportation in and out of Wuhan is major, MAJOR.

If we resign ourselves to the fact that we are unable to sustain ourselves even biologically, by doing so we admit that we are not important even for ourselves. So why would we be important for the world? The fate of such peoples is slow but certain obliteration, until they become a mere cloud of dust on the highway of nations.

This will crush those reservations. There are thriving towns in New Mexico that will have huge unemployment and a general loss of citizens as they are forced to move away. The ripple effect of so many people losing jobs will put a lot of small businesses out of business and local school boards will be flattened by the loss of revenue. You have to wonder if these Democrats have the slightest idea what their green energy fairy tale actually costs.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI started in the patch in Wyoming,  I've seen this happen every single time over 60 years boom and bust you lose everything you worked decades for . Next election season when the next party comes along everything goes back to work and start all over again. It's a vicious cycle that has to stop , people lifes are ruined marriages falls apart because of the chaos kids become parentless then criminals,  drug addicts,  it brings a serious breakdown in society's. This is bad governing living in fear that we can't work effectively against climate change is crazy .
