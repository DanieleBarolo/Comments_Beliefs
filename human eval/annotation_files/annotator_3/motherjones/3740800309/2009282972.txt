We all have different spoken accents, it's just not common to actually write them out.  The more you know...

If the United States wasn't handcuffed by the demography of the Senate the Democratic Party would be in a much better position to do something about gun violence. As it stands, though, we absolutely need those sparsely-populated states in the Midwest and Rockies to provide us enough Senators to do something about more existentially threatening issues like war, climate change, and the economy.


If you ask me, letting the rural states jack off with their exploding dildos at the cost of a few ten thousand people dead to suicide/homicide is a fucking bargain compared to the collateral damage of their flipping out after getting their toys taken away.

We can have sane conversations about, say, motorcycles. We can talk about appropriate design standards and extra licensing and age restrictions and even banning certain people from riding motorcycles in the way that we can't about guns. No one accuses people of talking about appropriate additives for gasolines as trying to sneak in a backdoor clause to stop motorcycle ownership. Nor does a discussion of requiring more stringent state inspection standards for motorcycles introduce cries of tyranny and slippery slopes towards forced public transportation. And certainly no one says or even thinks that a hypothetical state law from forbidding people under the age of 18 riding motorcycles on highways is an assault on the commerce clause of the Constitution.


Yet with firearm ownership we routinely see this kind of insane rhetorical brinksmanship. Which is why I call people who support this kind of talk gun fetishists. It shows a complete lack of perspective and I have nothing but disrespect for people who flip out this hard over the topic.

I am still waiting for a truly compelling argument for guns. When I ask pro-gun people this they just fall back on the 2nd amendment. Which is the equivalent of saying "Because." I have heard arguments about how the founding fathers apparently had some special wisdom which was only granted to people in 1776, and how they are so much smarter than anyone is today. So therefore it must be true. Yes. Lets burn some witches and be fearful of sailing off the edge of the earth, too.


Others argue it is to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government. I find this one to be the most ridiculous. If the government wants to crush you, they are going to crush you. They have the standing armies, they have the aircraft carriers, they have the smart bombs and the nuclear weapons. They have also shown little care for "collateral damage," so this idea that you are going to fend off a tyrannical government with your puny M16 (which you are illegally keeping despite your state's laws) is nonsense. It is nothing more than an adolescent fantasy that you need to get over. You've watched Top Gun FAR to many times.


I have no way of knowing what the Founding Fathers would say about gun violence in our country, and how it is connected to the 2nd Amendment, but if they are as smart as gun supporters believe, I think their answer would shock them.

    You're confusing a political right with a civil right.  The right to self defense is not considered a civil right.

        The unexamined life for you then, eh?    Sounds absolutely fascinating.

            I'll take that as a compliment, coming from a guy who uses "da" for effect.
