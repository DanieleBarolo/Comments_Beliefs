          This will not heal or bring the country together. The democrats are causing massive division. Very irresponsible and reckless decision… The country is now further apart than in any other point in history, except for maybe one other time…

            <b>Q:  How many Democrats does it take to fix a problem?
A:  No one knows. It has never happened.</b> They are too busy creating problems to have the time to think about fixing any of them.

              <b>Q:  How many Bidens does it take to screw a country?
A:  Just one.</b>  But we have at least four just for good measure.
