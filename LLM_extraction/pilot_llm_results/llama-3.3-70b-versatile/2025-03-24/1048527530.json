  "article_body": "NEW YORK, Sept. 17 (UPI)\u2013British pop star Elton John says he is concerned about Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga because both young singers are exhibiting alarming behavior.\u201cI\u2019d like to be able to talk to her right now, but I can\u2019t get through to her,\u201d John told The Australian about Lady Gaga, the godmother of his two sons.\u201cAnd there are times when you have to listen. When your persona begins to take over your music and becomes more important, you enter a dangerous place. Once you have people around you who don\u2019t question you, you\u2019re in a dangerous place,\u201d John told the newspaper. \u201cLook at Lindsay Lohan. There was someone with a successful career and her parents completely [expletive] her up. The dad was in jail and the mum was doing coke with her. Great!\u201dHe went on to say he looks at Cyrus and sees \u201ca meltdown waiting to happen.\u201d\u201cAnd she\u2019s so young!\u201d John said. \u201cBut she\u2019s got two records in the top 20, so who is going to stop her?\u201d",
