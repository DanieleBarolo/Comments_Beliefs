With this logic, you should be fearful of roads in general then, since cars kill tens of thousands a year.

Trump has been trying to help protect us from this and liberals have overuled him at every step.

The Sudanese immigrant who shot up a White Christian Church in Tennessee, now we see this horrific attack.

You liberal sanctuary city appeasers are to blame for this carnage!

The 9th Circuit should feel proud they stopped our President from protecting our homeland.

Sickening!!

PARENT COMMENT:
2nd amendment rights are not supreme. You cannot have freedom if society is fearful.

The proliferation of these killing implements have caused a breakdown of freedoms. We can't go to public spaces without the freedom from being searched. 

You can't move freely without the fear of a lunatic with access to a gun. 

You cannot live free of fear from losing your life if everyone has a gun. It is not an equalizer. It makes it more likely you will lose your life to gun violence. 

In my mind other freedoms are supreme to owning a gun.
