Garland's speech yesterday and President Biden labelin' Trump as the undisputed leader of the #January6th attack sounds like a one-two punch kickin' off 2022 as the year of accountability for those who sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

      Wow! Even Belarus doesn’t want them? Haha! We should have created MAGAstan right next to Afghanistan and then left to watch what happens when they’re surrounded by people who want to kill them with nowhere to go.
