Iran defies the UN, so we sink its Persian Gulf fleet. China expands its air defense zone, so we start downing Chinese fighters. North Korea fires some missiles, so we send a CIA assassin with Dennis Rodman\u2019s entourage on the next basketball trip.Why is has any of this become unthinkable? We\u2019re the world\u2019s lone superpower\u2013since when did we become such complete wimps?We\u2019re afraid of escalation. We worry, for example, that any military response to Russia could lead to \u201cnuclear war,\u201d as Secretary of State John Kerry warned last week.If so, why doesn\u2019t that worry Putin when he sends thugs into Ukraine? If so, why did Iran pause its nuclear program in 2003, after we invaded Iraq over Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons programs?The answer is that weakness, not aggression, invites escalation by our enemies.We\u2019re afraid of being called the global cowboys, the world police. But we are anyway, regardless of what we do.Putintoldthe Duma on Tuesday that U.S. foreign policy amounted to \u201crule by the gun\u201d\u2013after months of craven appeasement by the Obama administration, after the U.S. sent Spam to Ukrainian troops rather than weapons.As long as we will be hated by tyrants anyway, why not do something truly worthy of fear by our enemies?We conservatives mock Obama\u2019s foreign policy failures. But the truth is that we are also paralyzed by a kind of moral terror. We are afraid to be honest with the American people about the sacrifices that will continue to be necessary to defend our freedom and security. Too few of us have shared those sacrifices, so we stop ourselves from stating the painfully obvious: to avoid war, we have to be willing to risk it.When will we find that courage?\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n1289990534\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI'm not suggesting a war with Russia or anyone for that matter.

Or our little Arab Street jingle can be fully understood\u00a0by just adding one word \u2013 JEW. You see, Al-Banna realized that the only way Palestine could be free was if that freedom went from the river, the Jordan River on the eastern border of Israel to the sea, \u00a0the Mediterranean Sea, on the western border of Israel. Again it is at this point that the mildly curious \u00a0asks, \u201cFree from what?\u201d What must Israel be free of that is so important to the Founder of the Muslim \u00a0Brotherhood in the 1920\u2019s and to the Armani Jihadis on the street corners today? What freedom do \u00a0these followers of the Religion of Peace want when they all chant in unison,\u00a0\u201cFrom-the-River-to-the-Sea, Palestine-will-be-Free\u201d\u00a0becoming increasingly louder and more violent at the mere appearance of a Star \u00a0of David on a child\u2019s yarmulke? For the answer to this perplexing question let\u2019s look at that one word\u00a0again \u2013 JEW. If you take that word \u2013 JEW \u2013 and place it in our cute Arab rhyme then the code is broken,\u00a0the puzzle solved and genocide is served on a historic platter. Here, take a look at this revised version\u00a0and you will have eyes that see the obliteration of Israel and the Jew.: \u201cFrom-the-River-to-the-Sea, Palestine-will-be-JEW-Free.\u201dAsk the true followers of Mohamed and they will tell you, \u201cyeah, yeah, yeah, maybe is some other\u00a0lifetime Israel was the homeland of the Jews but since the conquest of Mohamedism in the Holy Land,\u00a0that formerly Jewish real estate has now become Waqf, the Arabic concept of \u201csacred space.\u201d Or to\u00a0state it a bit more colloquially, \u201cFrom-the-River-to-the-Sea, Palestine-will-be-JEW-Free.\u201dAs Israel is in a battle for its very existence watch our special presentation and understand that the HAMAS members on the street corner in Miami are the same exact people that the IDF are fighting in\u00a0the tunnels of Gaza. In a very real sense the disposition of the war in Gaza will have a profound effect on the wannabe jihadis in Miami. If HAMAS is victorious in Gaza, which means anything less than their total\u00a0military destruction, then our home-grown Miami HAMAS will pen a new iteration of an this old jingle\u00a0and it will go something like this:\u201cFrom-the-Miami-River-to-the-Atlantic-Sea, Miami-will-finally-be-JEW-Free.\u201dTom Trento, for The United West\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n1500049075\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI don't think there was any cross-breeding with goats \u2013 the average intelligence level would be higher than it is, and goats have higher standards.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The President did not take questions.The President\u2019s remarks follow Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019sresponse to the terrorist attack, in which he called \u201con Palestinian leadership at every single level to condemn this in the most powerful terms.\u201d Palestinian Authority head\u00a0Mahmoud Abbas, on his end, nominally condemned the attackwhile\u201cstressing the need to end the causes of such attacks like tensions over what Jews call the Temple Mount and Palestinians call al-Aqsa Mosque.\u201d Such a dismissal of the increasingly out-of-control terrorist activity by Palestinian extremistsreceived the typical benefit of the doubt from mainstream media.As previously mentioned, four were killed during the attack\u2013 three,theNew York Postreports, were American citizens.Photos released by the IDF officeshow significant bloodshed, indicating that the axes were used in killing those praying in the synagogue. Those congregated there had assembled for morning prayers; the assailants were armed with both guns and axes. Both assailants were Arab Palestinians, and both were killed on sight.This attack is the latest in a string in Jerusalem in recent months. Two such attacks perpetrated on Israeli Jewish residents of Jerusalem were done so using a car.In one incident, a Palestinian assailant drove his car into a group of Jewish Israelis, killing a three-month-old Chaya Zissel, a US citizen. In the aftermath of that attack, a senior Palestinian Authority aidecalled the killer a \u201cheroic martyr,\u201dand both Hamas and Fatah applauded the attack.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n1702223263\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nNationalistic AND religious nuts.

Now look, if they can prove me wrong, like I said I\u2019ll pay with my life. Since they want to kill me anyway. Prove me wrong We\u2019re dealing with thieves, liars and murderers. Listen to this. We know that many Israelis were arrested immediately after the attack, but quickly released and sent to Israel.\u201d\u201cWe know that many Jews received a text message not to come to workSeptember 11. Who sent that message, that keep them from showing up. Within minutes of the attacks Ehud Barak, the founder and master of the Israeli military covert\u00a0 force was in a London studio of the BBC blaming Osama bin Laden and calling for a war on terror. We know that Benjamin Netanyahu told an audience in Israel, we are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon and the American struggle in Iraq. He added that these catastrophes and wars will swing the American public opinion in favor of Israel\u201d he added.Farrakhan concluded, \u201cIt now appears 9/11 was a false flag operation, which is an attack from one country but made to appear like an attack from another in order to start a war between them.

They plan to sell a statue of Forrest as well\u2013they are thinking of \u201cselling the statue to anyone who wants it.\u201dForrest was a businessman who become wealthy in the cotton trade prior to the Civil War. He abandoned that to fight federal forces once the war commenced, eventually becoming a lieutenant general in the Confederate Army. He was known for waging brutal warfare against federal forces in Mississippi and Tennessee.The Forrest family has made clear that they are \u201csolidly opposed to digging up the graves and moving them any place.\u201d They are opposed to moving the statue as well.Some believe the Memphis City Council vote is another example of the anti-Confederacy hysteria that swept parts of the country after a photo surfaced of alleged Charleston gunman Dylann Roof posing with a Confederate flag. But city council member Janis Fullilove asked if the move has something to do with a rumored \u201c$500 million [University of Tennessee] expansion\u201d that would use the land where Forrest is currently buried.Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter:@AWRHawkins.

While the media reports each new arrival, nothing speaks louder than pictures of these people risking their lives to reach Europe. The migrant crisis continues unabated throughout the continent this week.A photo of a\u00a0Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach has captivated the world this week, prompting international outrage from both supporters and opponents of granting asylum to these refugees.As the crisis has developed throughout the year, hundreds of photos spanning Spain to Turkey tell the story of these deadly journeys. Some end in safety, but many have ended in tragedy.Authorities report that Italy, Malta, and Greece have received the greatest number of migrants.The people pay smugglers to travel on boats not meant for human cargo, packed in tightly. There is no food, water, shelter, or bathroom.Countries erected fences years ago to prevent illegal border crossings, but the structures have not been able to stop people like the\u00a0man in the photo below. His expression alone shows the world what these people will do to escape poverty, war, and destruction.Boat rides are incredibly dangerous because many\u00a0people do not know how to swim, coming from landlocked countries.Personnel from European countries have done\u00a0everything they can to help those who manage to survive the deadly journey.Once these people reach land, they often want to keep going deeper into Europe. Macedonia and Hungary are the latest land-locked countries to receive thousands of migrants. Families are desperate to move to nations like France and the UK, where they believe they can find a better life.https://twitter.com/TheHungaryNews/status/635817193813381120(ROBERT ATANASOVSKI/AFP/Getty Images)(ROBERT ATANASOVSKI/AFP/Getty Images)DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP/Getty ImagesOn multiple occasions, the migrants have interrupted mass transit by rushing trains and attempting to smuggle themselves onboard.Migrants delayed a Eurostar train in Calais, France, in order to enter Britain.

Armed with combat experience and extremist connections, many of them are only a plane-flight away from our shores,\u201d it adds. \u201cEven if they do not return home to plot attacks, foreign fighters have taken the lead in recruiting a new generation of terrorists and are seeking to radicalize Westerners online to spread terror back home.\u201dTheforeign fighterswho have traveled to join ISIS come from more than 100 countries.\u201cOf the hundreds of Americans who have sought to travel to the conflict zone in Syria and Iraq, authorities have only interdicted a fraction of them,\u201d the report acknowledges. \u201cSeveral dozen have also managed to make it back into America.\u201dThe House panel noted that several Americans were identified and apprehended trying to return to the United States while others are being monitored.\u201cThe findings are concerning; we are losing in this struggle to keep Americans from the battlefield,\u201dHouse Homeland Security CommitteeChairman Michael McCaul (R-TX)said Tuesday after the report was released.In the report, Chairman McCaul\u2019s committee accused the Obama administration of lacking a strategy to prevent the flow of Americans to Iraq and Syria, identify those who attempt to return to engage in terrorism, or cope with new recruitment methods and technology that allow ISIS to disseminate its propaganda.Rep. John Katko (R-NY), who co-authored the report, said the radicalization of Americans via the Internet \u201cposes probably the biggest problem\u201d for U.S. law enforcement and others trying to detect and combat the recruitment efforts of\u00a0jihadists groups who target Americans.\u201cResearch also finds attacks conducted by returnees are more deadly than those carried out by homegrown extremists. These worries have materialized in the United States this year, as several American returnees have been arrested and charged by authorities,\u201d notes the report.\u201cHowever, American returnees are not the only threat to the United States. Other Western citizens in the conflict zone\u2014from dozens of countries\u2014can travel easily to U.S. territory without applying for a visa, including most European jihadists,\u201d it adds. \u201cEuropean security officials estimate 20 to 30 percent of their foreign fighters have already departed Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSometimes a problem is easily solved.

Legislation should be understood by all interested parties before it is voted on.\u201dIna speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2010, Boehner also promised that three full days meant \u201cat least 72 hours.\u201dBy scheduling a vote on Wednesday\u2014any time before 11:36 p.m. on Thursday, actually\u2014Boehner would be violating that pledge.Boehner is also putting the chances of his likely successor, House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), at risk. Ryan has indicated he thinks the \u201cprocess stinks\u201d on this, but is planning to review the deal in its entirety before making a decision one way or the other.Ryan\u2019s office has refused to answer a series of basic questions from Breitbart News on whether he believes all Republicans in the House should support or oppose the deal, what took him so long to comment on the deal at all (he still hasn\u2019t weighed in on the substance just the process), whether he would support Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) remaining on as Majority Leader if he becomes Speaker after McCarthy contradicted him on the process of the deal, and whether Ryan would allow staffers who were involved in this process who currently work for Boehner to remain working for the Speaker\u2019s office if and when this takes over. Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck, over the course of several emails on Tuesday, openly refused to answer each of those questions. Buck used to work for Boehner.The Associated Presscaptured in its piece on Tuesdayjust how high stakes this game is for Ryan\u2019s chances.\u201cThe House budget vote slated for Wednesday would come on the same day as the GOP caucus nominates its candidate, widely expected to be Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan,\u201d the Associated Press wrote.That means that as the House votes on this monstrosity, it will also be voting to nominate Ryan as the GOP conference official candidate for the Speakership\u2014setting him up for a floor vote on Thursday at which Ryan needs to win a majority of those present and voting for a person.If he fails to achieve that absolute majority on the floor\u2014something absolutely possible since Rep. Daniel Webster (R-FL) is still running against him\u2014then it could set up a catastrophic-for-Ryan second ballot fight at which point Ryan would likely eventually step aside. It\u2019s still entirely uncertain what is going to happen between now and Thursday, but with Ryan siding with the establishment in Washington on things like this it\u2019s highly unlikely there will be a clear answer until it all goes down. Making matters more interesting, too, is that GOP presidential candidates are arriving in Boulder, Colorado. All are likely going to face questions about this highly unpopular deal going down in Washington.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2331145372\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe M uslim B rotherhood and/or its enablers and apologists are in Washington, our schools, our universities, our military, actually most of our institutions and nobody gives a hoot.

These fences have provedso securethat the number of migrants in Hungary has dropped dramatically to pre-crisis levels.In September, when the border was closed, up 10,000 migrants a day crossed illegally into Hungary, but now that figure has fallen to just dozens.The policy has proved so successful that other European nations are considering building their own fences, including Austria which was initially highly critical of Mr Orban\u2019s policy.Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also strongly criticised European leaders for failing to protect their borders.Speaking at the Second Annual Margaret Thatcher Gala dinner in the City of London, Mr Abbott said:\u201cAll countries that say \u2018anyone who gets here can stay here\u2019 are now in peril, given the scale of the population movements that are starting to be seen. There are tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of people living in poverty and danger who might readily seek to enter a Western country if the opportunity is there.\u201cWho could blame them? Yet no country or continent can open its borders to all comers without fundamentally weakening itself.

In an email sent to top Department of State officials, at 7:19 p.m. ET, only hours after the attack had begun, Bash says, \u201cwe have identified the forces that could move to Benghazi. They are spinning up as we speak.\u201d The Obama administration redacted the details of the military forces available, oddly citing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption that allows the withholding of \u201cdeliberative process\u201d information.Bash\u2019s email seems to directly contradict testimony given by then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2013. Defending the Obama administration\u2019s lack of military response to the nearly six-hour attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi,Panetta claimedthat \u201ctime, distance, the lack of an adequate warning, events that moved very quickly on the ground prevented a more immediate response.\u201dThis latest bombshell Judicial Watch has released to the public has attracted considerable media attention. TheWashington Examinerreported on these revelations:While parts of the email were redacted, the message indicates the Pentagon was waiting for approval from the State Department to send the forces in. That help never arrived for the Americans under siege at the Benghazi compound. A spokesman for the House Select Committee on Benghazi said investigators had received the unredacted version of the email, which was obtained by Judicial Watch through the Freedom of Information Act and made public Tuesday, last year but had declined to make it public.Now would be a good time to go back and review the Obama administration\u2019s many prevarications on the Benghazi terrorist attacks. (A significant collection of our history-making work on the Benghazi scandal isavailable here.)You may recall that thefirst assaultoccurred at the main compound at about 9:40 p.m. local time (3:40 p.m. ET in Washington, DC). The second attack on a CIA annex 1.2 miles away began three hours later, at about 12 a.m. local time the following morning (6 p.m. ET), and ended at approximately 5:15 a.m. local time (11:15 a.m. ET) with a mortar attack that killed security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.The newly released email reads:From: Bash, Jeremy CIV SD [REDACTED]Sent: Tuesday, September 11, 2012 7:19 PMTo: Sullivan, Jacob J; Sherman, Wendy R; Nides, Thomas RCc: Miller, James HON OSD POLICY; Wienefeld, James A ADM JSC VCJCS; Kelly, John LtGen SD; martin, dempsey [REDACTED]Subject: LibyaState colleagues:I just tried you on the phone but you were all in with S [apparent reference to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton].After consulting with General Dempsey, General Ham and the Joint Staff, we have identified the forces that could move to Benghazi. They are spinning up as we speak. They include a [REDACTED].Assuming Principals agree to deploy these elements, we will ask State to procure the approval from host nation. Please advise how you wish to convey that approval to us [REDACTED].JeremyJacob Sullivan was deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the time of the terrorist attack at Benghazi.\u00a0 Wendy Sherman was under secretary of State for Political Affairs, the fourth-ranking official in the U.S. Department of State. Thomas Nides was the deputy secretary of state for Management and Resources.The timing of the Bash email is particularly significant based upontestimony given to members of Congressby Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission of the U.S. embassy in Tripoli at the time of the Benghazi terrorist attack. According to Hicks\u2019 2013 testimony, a show of force by the U.S. military during the siege could have prevented much of the carnage. Said Hicks:If we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over Benghazi as quickly as possible after the attack commenced, I believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because I believe the Libyans would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them.Ultimately, Special Operations forces on their own initiative traveled from Tripoli to Benghazi to provide support during the attack. Othermilitary assetswere only used to recover the dead and wounded and to evacuate U.S. personnel from Libya. In fact,other documentsreleased in October by Judicial Watch show that only one U.S. plane was available to evacuate Americans from Benghazi to Tripoli, and thatraises questionsabout whether a delay of military support led to additional deaths in Benghazi.As per usual, we only obtained this document after going to federal court. The new email came as a result of a Judicial WatchFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuitfiled on September 4, 2014, seeking:Records related to notes, updates, or reports created in response to the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. This request includes, but is not limited to, notes taken by then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or employees of the Office of the Secretary of State during the attack and its immediate aftermath.The Obama administration and Clinton officials hid this compelling Benghazi email for years. The email makes readily apparent that the military was prepared to launch immediate assistance that could have made a difference, at least at the CIA Annex. The fact that the Obama administration withheld this email for so long only worsens the scandal of Benghazi.TheWashington Examinerputs it very well:The newly disclosed email chain casts doubt on previous testimony from high-level officials, several of whom suggested there was never any kind of military unit that could have been in a position to mount a rescue mission during the hours-long attack on Benghazi.It came out later that day that the House Select Committee on Benghazi had been withholding from the public an unredacted version of the email released by Judicial Watch. Almost immediately upon Judicial Watch\u2019s release of the devastating email, a spokesman for the House Select Committee on Benghazi made a snide, sour-grapes announcement toThe Daily Callerattempting to defend the Committee\u2019s decision to keep the email secret for a year by implicitly criticizing Judicial Watch\u2019s supposed \u201crush to release or comment on every document it uncovers.\u201d Bad enough fighting the lawless secrecy of the Obama administration \u2013 so it is disappointing to have the unnecessary spitballs from presumed allies for transparency.The Democrats on the Select Committee thought they helped their cause of defending the indefensible byreleasinga complete version of the email. Hardly. The new details show that the military forces that were not deployed, specifically \u201ca SOF [Special Operations Forces] element that was in Croatia (which can fly to Suda Bay, Crete), and a Marine FAST [Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team] team out of Rota, Spain.\u201d The FAST Team arrivedwell after the attack, and the Special Operations Forces never left Croatia. In addition to providing confirming details that forces were ready to go, the Democrats expose the Obama administration\u2019s dishonesty in withholding the information in the first place.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat lying Clinton b!tch!

In order for reason to triumph, Schwab surmises, \u201cwe have to re-establish a sense that we all are in the same boat.\u201dA simple economic analysis of falling commodity prices is insufficient, Schwab suggests. Instead, leaders must examine the deeper causes of the present crisis, as well as the long-term effects both on the economy and on society as a whole.\u201cFirst, we have to look at the root causes of this,\u201d Schwab said. \u201cThe normal citizen today is overwhelmed by the complexity and rapidity of what\u2019s happening, not only in the political world but also the technological field.\u201dSchwab speaks of a time of \u201cunexpected consequences\u201d to describe a world where local decisions have repercussions throughout the globe, in ways that are difficult to foresee. It is this lack of foresight, on the other hand, that has led to \u201cerosion of trust in decision makers.\u201dAlong with his fears of heightened European migration, Schwab has also expressed his concern that technological innovation may cost some 20 million jobs in the coming years, which in turn could risk \u201chollowing out the middle class,\u201d which he calls \u201ca pillar of our democracies.\u201dCuriously, after issuing his dire predictions of an invasion of immigrants of unprecedented proportions and the implosion of the middle class, Schwab accused U.S. Republicans of fear-mongering.Schwab toldCNBCthat presidential candidate Donald Trump and other politicians were guilty of playing on people\u2019s fears, but he would welcome him at WEF anyway.Follow Thomas D.

No graphic photos of real babies are used in the series.\u201cI\u2019d like to challenge the abortion lobby \u2013 Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and the rest \u2013 to respond to these videos,\u201d Lila Rose said during a web conference for media Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cAfter seeing the videos, most people would have a difficult time telling a woman that abortion is \u2018health care\u2019 or \u2018empowering,\u2019\u201dRose, president of Live Action, said her group\u2019s nine years of video investigations have led to the realization that most of the general public is uninformed about what happens during an abortion.\u201cThe abortion lobby masks the procedure in euphemisms,\u201d she explained. \u201c\u2019Terminating the pregnancy,\u2019 \u2018tissue mass,\u2019 \u2018product of conception.\u2019 The majority of the public has no clue about what abortion really does to a child in the womb; how developed the child actually is during an abortion; and\u00a0the risks of abortion to the mother\u2019s health and safety.\u201dRose described the abortion industry\u2019s continued denial of the presence of a human baby during pregnancy. By way of example, she referred to abortion political advocacy groupNARAL\u2019s tweetduring the Super Bowl, protesting a Doritos ad featuring parents viewing their unborn baby\u2019s ultrasound. NARAL attacked what it called the ad\u2019s \u201canti-choice tactic of humanizing fetuses.\u201dThe new web video series, Rose says, will \u201cchange the debate about abortion.\u201d\u201cOur experience shows that once someone sees the reality of abortion, it\u2019s hard for them to go back and justify it,\u201d she asserted.The series consists of four videos \u2013 each about four minutes in length. The videos reflect accurate medical information about abortion and use animated medical depictions inside the uterus. Though the videos do not show graphic photos of abortion, the medical animations allow the public to see the violence of abortion.According to Live Action, all information presented in the videos is backed up by peer-reviewed medical journals and has been reviewed by practicing OB/GYNs, medical professionals, and former abortionists.The four videos \u2013 located atwww.AbortionProcedures.com\u2013 address the most common abortion procedures:The abortion pill \u2013 which deprives the unborn baby of blood and nourishment until it diesThe suction D&C \u2013 which uses a vacuum to pull the baby apartThe D&E abortion \u2013 which uses forceps to tear limbs from larger babiesThe chemical injection abortion that stops the fetal heart and causes the mother to deliver the baby stillborn a few days later\u201cAfter seeing these videos, the public isn\u2019t going to buy the rhetoric of the abortion lobby,\u201d Rose states.\u00a0\u201cIn 2016, \u2018war on women\u2019 and \u2018extremist\u2019 labels just won\u2019t work.\u201cIn four short minutes, Americans will see the reality of abortion,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the last thing the abortion industry wants, because it knows that once people are exposed to the violence of abortion, they reject it.\u201dA recent Marist College Institute for Public Opinionpollfound a full 81 percent of Americans favor some restrictions on abortion \u2013 including limiting the procedure after the first three months \u2013 and a continued ban on public funding of abortion.In the survey of 1,700 Americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, \u201cAbortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.\u201d\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2532808260\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThere is a big market for babies to adopt.

The Easter Sunday bombing is the fifthattackby the group since December 2015.The death toll for Sunday\u2019s massacre now stands at 72 victims, mostly women and children, along with at least 320 injured.The 28-year-old suicidebomberYousuf Farid blew himself up Sunday in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park in Lahore, where hundreds of Christian families had gathered to celebrate the feast of Easter. The bomber placed himself near an area of the park where small children were playing sports and outdoor games.As of Monday morning, Pakistani police had arrested 15 people including three brothers of the young suicide bomber who blew himself up among the families.Pakistan is a confessional Islamic state with a huge Muslim majority, and its 2 million Christians make up less than 2 percent of the country\u2019s population of more than 182 million people.Sunday\u2019s bombing was thedeadliestjihadist attack in Pakistan since the December 2014 massacre of 134 school children at a military run academy in the city of Peshawar.Pakistani Christians have long protested the lack of government protection from terrorist attacks and random, unsubstantiated accusations of blasphemy.Father Bernardo Cervellera, the director of AsiaNews, told Vatican Radio after last March\u2019s attack that both Catholics and Protestants have continually complained of the lack of security on the part of thegovernmentof Punjab, where there have been repeated \u201cviolence and attacks on churches and mosques on the part of the Taliban.\u201dAccording to eyewitnesses of that attack, \u201csome of the policemen who were supposed to be guarding these churches, were in a bar watching a cricket match instead.\u201dCervellera said that the government of Pakistan has always been \u201cambiguous towards the Taliban.\u201d On the one hand, he said, \u201cit has always protected them and given them shelter and refuge,\u201d mainly in northern Pakistan, and at the same time, Pakistan is supposedly allied with the international community to combat terrorism.Cervellera also said that \u201cthe Taliban have spread throughout the land because during all these years they have managed to create some 20,000-25,000 Koranic schools that teach fundamentalist Islam,\u201d and as a result, \u201cthere are extremists everywhere,\u201d who fight against both Christians and Shiites.Listen to the discussion of this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:Follow Thomas D.

On Sunday, 636 migrants were rescued in Maltese waters as well from two failing vessels.Tuesday\u2019s arrivals brought the total number of migrants by sea into Italy to 31,000 so far this year, a trend expected to continue as Italy has become virtually the sole point of entry into Europe.According to a number of humanitarian organizations, the sea passage between Libya and Italy has now become the prime route for asylum-seekers heading for Europe, as the so-called \u201cBalkan route\u201d was closed by Macedonian border controls and a European Union deal with Turkey on immigration.Since the beginning of 2015, more than 1.2 million Arab, African and Asian migrants have flooded into the European Union in the hope of finding a better life than the one they are fleeing.Follow Thomas D.

He was denied bail during a court appearance later in the day. His court-appointed attorney said he was living out of his car and in the country illegally after overstaying a visa.Sanford has not entered a plea.The arrest happened relatively quietly at a campaign stop seen as peaceful compared to the mayhem at the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s recent events in San Jose, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.Gregg Donovan was among about 1,500 gathered Saturday to see Trump at the Treasure Island casino on the Las Vegas Strip. For the event, he donned the top hat and red jacket that made him recognizable in his former job as swanky Beverly Hills\u2019 official greeter for more than a decade.Donovan said he didn\u2019t know about the charge against Sanford until he saw news reports. But he recognized him because the two had stood in line together for nine hours waiting to get into the Trump event. Sanford even held Donovan\u2019s spot in line for a bathroom break.\u201cI was No. 5, and he was No. 4,\u201d Donovan said.They spoke, Donovan said, though Sanford didn\u2019t say much and seemed \u201cstrange.\u201d Donovan didn\u2019t elaborate on what made Sanford seem odd.After waiting, they passed through metal detectors manned by Secret Service, police and casino security officials.Federal Magistrate Judge George Foley said in court Monday that Sandford was a potential danger to the community and a flight risk. Sandford wore leg irons and appeared to tremble during the hearing.Heather Fraley, his assigned public defender, said Sandford appeared to be competent. She said he hadn\u2019t been diagnosed with a mental illness but that he has autism and previously attempted suicide. He doesn\u2019t have a job.Sanford\u2019s mother told court researchers that he was treated for obsessive compulsive disorder and anorexia when he was younger, and that he once ran away from a hospital in England, according to the public defender.Fraley argued that Sandford should go to a halfway house because he didn\u2019t have a criminal history, but the judge said he should stay in detention ahead of a July 5 court date.Agents said Sandford told them he had been in the U.S. for about a year and a half, lived in Hoboken, New Jersey, and drove to the San Bernardino, California, area before coming to Las Vegas on June 16.Sandford told officers he was convinced he would die in the assassination attempt. He said he also reserved a ticket for a Trump rally in Phoenix, scheduled for later Saturday, as a backup plan.The criminal complaint said Sandford was arrested after grabbing the handle of an officer\u2019s gun while trying to remove it from a holster.Sanford told authorities that he went to the Battlefield Vegas shooting range the day before the rally and fired 20 rounds from a 9mm Glock pistol to learn how to use it. Police detectives who visited the range spoke with an employee who confirmed that he provided Sandford shooting lessons, according to the complaint signed by Secret Service Special Agent Joseph Hall.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThis will somehow be blamed on Trump.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The President and Secretary agreed that all parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected Government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed.\u00a0The Secretary underscored that the State Department will continue to focus on the safety and security of U.S. citizens in Turkey. The President asked the Secretary to continue to keep him updated as the situation unfolds.Obamaentered power in 2009 hoping to use Turkey\u2019s Islamist president to help remake politics in the Middle East \u2014 but the wished-for alliance crashed as Erdogan\u2019s Islamist government became more radical year by year.Obama met with Erdogan multiple times during his first four-year term.In January, 2012, Obama said Erdogan is one of his top allies.\u00a0\u201cI think that if you ask them, [Germany\u2019s] Angela Merkel or [Indian] Prime Minister Singh or [Korea\u2019s] President Lee or [Turkey\u2019s] Prime Minister Erdogan or [U.K.] David Cameron would say \u2018We have a lot of trust and confidence in the President \u2026 We think he\u2019s paying attention to our concerns and our interests,\u2019\u201d he told Newsweek interviewer Fareed Zakaria.In March 2012, at a meeting in South Korea, Obama declared about Erdogan \u201cthat we find ourselves in frequent agreement upon a wide range of issues\u2026 [and] because he has two daughters that are a little older than mine \u2014 they\u2019ve turned out very well, so I\u2019m always interested in his perspective on raising girls.\u201dErdogan has pushed step-by-step create an Islamic state. That Islamic push is being resisted by secular, educated Turks, mostly in the major cities.Erdogan has also tried to revive the defunct Ottoman Empire by building a new presidential palace and surrounding himself with guards dressed as the soldiers of the Ottoman empire, which collapsed in 1920. That push has been strongly resisted by neighboring Arab countries, and largely ignored by European governments.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2785797018\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI would guess he pictures himself as a reincarnation of the last caliph of the ottoman Empire, Abd\u00fclmecid II.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The pair married in an Islamic ceremony in Idlib, northern Syria in December 2013, before heading to Raqqa where they lived in a wealthy area with Jones\u2019s younger son, Joe, theTelegraphhasreported.Changing her name to Sakinah Hussain, and her son\u2019s to Hamza, Jones spent the first six weeks of her new life at a training camp in the city where she was taught Sharia law and tested for loyalty to the group; her husband meanwhile was sent to a training camp in the countryside.A few weeks after his return he took a second wife, a young local Muslim girl. Despite this Jones appears to have remained committed both to her husband and to Islamic State, posting messages on Twitter under the name Umm Hussain al-Britani encouraging attacks on the West and vowing to behead the opponents of Islam.She is believed to have recruited dozens of women for Islamic State in this way before her accounts were shut down.Meanwhile Junaid, a competent hacker, quickly rose up the ranks within the terror group, recruiting sympathisers in the West to carry out lone wolf attacks, as well as masterminding some of the highest profile hacking attacks.His efforts earned him third place on America\u2019s hit-list, behind Islamic State\u2019s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the notorious British executioner Mohammed Emwazi, also known as \u201cJihadi John\u201d.In August 2015 America was successful in targeting Hussain; he was killed in a drone strike on his car. While his younger wife has gone on to remarry, Jones, 47, has remained single.\u201cUmm Hussain did not marry again as she is considered old and Isil fighters prefer young girls,\u201d an activist from the underground movement Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently told theTelegraph.She is believed to receive a monthly salary from Islamic State of $700 (\u00a3520), plus a bonus of $300 every few months for being the widow of a respected \u201cshahid\u201d, or martyr.However, the death of her husband hasn\u2019t diluted her zeal for the terror group. If anything, the activist said, she appears to have become more violent as she blames the West for her husband\u2019s death.Following his death she has been placed in charge of training all European female recruits, or \u201cmuhajirat\u201d, leading the female wing of the Anwar al-Awlaki battalion, a fighting force founded by her husband composed of European recruits and tasked with planning and carrying out attacks on the West.She teaches the women under her charge to fight, use weapons, and carry out \u201csuicide missions against Western targets\u201d.A Syrian Islamic State defector confirmed her new status.\u201cIsil respects her because she is the widow of Junaid, who was very important to the group,\u201d said the former fighter, who declined to be named.\u201cThey want to send a message to their important fighters that they will respect their families and guarantee a good life for them after their death.\u201cUmm Hussain is also influential in her own right. She was the reason Isil was able to recruit a lot of Western girls to Raqqa: it\u2019s not easy to convince a Christian, rock girl to become an extremist.\u201dHer son, who is approaching his twelfth birthday, is also being trained as a jihadi fighter in a camp for boys under the age of 14. The pupils are taught Arabic, English, French, Sharia law, and how to use weapons in combat.Michael S. Smith II, a counter-terrorism adviser to members of the U.S. Congress, told theTelegraphhe had long suspected Jones was more than just a jihadi bride.\u201cEarlier this year, Sally Jones implied to me (on social media) she may be training female terrorists for deployment to execute attacks in the West.\u201cIt is unsurprising that the Islamic State may be grooming female terrorists,\u201d he added.\u201cThe deployment of female fighters and suicide bombers, notably women whose male family members died while waging jihad, became a common occurrence after Abu Musab al-Zarqawi organised the group now called the Islamic State.\u201dOn Thursday, Europe\u2019s first all-female terrorist cell werearrestedin Paris plotting an attack using a car laden with gas cylinders. The car had been parked near the Notre Dame cathedral, a major landmark in the city. All three girls were known to security services as they had previously tried to travel to Syria.Anti-terrorism prosecutor Fran\u00e7ois Molins told reporters that the plot showed women had assumed a new role within Islamic State. \u201cThe terrorist organisation uses not only women, but young women, who get to know them and develop their plot from a distance,\u201d he said.It is not yet clear whether the girls had a direct link to Jones, but Molins added the girls had been directed remotely by \u201cSyria-based individuals within the ranks of the Daesh [Islamic State] terrorist organisation [which] shows that this organisation intends to make combatants of women\u201d.Follow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter:Follow @Donna_R_Eor e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nStrange, isn't it, that the first thing that a convert to \"the religion of peace\" does is to engage in terrorism.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

But the historian, who has published several books on the Holocaust, argues that textbooks\u2019 sanitisation of Muslim conquests and their presentation of an Islamic supremacist version of history is completely unhelpful.The historian says textbooks focus on the \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d of Muslims and Christians and that official guidelines tell teachers not to study \u201cevents that tend to emphasise the warlike contacts\u201d.She draws attention to the fact that, incredibly, books use the term \u201cresuming control\u201d when describing Mohammed\u2019s conquests of previously non-Muslim areas. This presents as legitimate \u201creconquests\u201d the warlord\u2019s bloody takeovers of regions that were never previously Muslim, nor his territory.This directive is ignored, shenotes, when it comes to the Crusades, as prominent textbooks title their chapter on the subject of Christian self-defence \u201cViolent Holy Wars\u201d. This period of history, and the Spanish people\u2019s reconquest of their own country, is told through a series of bloodthirsty \u201ccrimes\u201d, Lefebvre notes.The focal point of peaceful cooperation between the two religions is exemplified by trading relations in the French curriculum. However, Lefebvre observes that even this narrative follows a Muslim supremacist agenda as textbooks \u201cunanimously describe Islamic civilisation as \u2018brilliant\u2019\u201d and claim that all the West is hugely in debt to Arabic science.To hammer home the discredited idea that Muslims were wise educators to Europe\u2019s ignorant cave-dwellers, the professor discloses that textbooks quote a Muslim occupier as saying: \u201cThis country does not know what science is and those who lived knew no one here who had made himself illustrious by his love for knowledge.\u201dLefebvre notes that, to emphasise this one-sided narrative, students\u00a0are asked to \u201cshow that the presence of Muslims in Andalusia helps develop science and Greek philosophy in the West\u201d in their assessment.The professor describes as \u201cdisconcerting\u201d the fact that textbooks rely entirely on Muslim sources for accounts of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims.As a result, pupils in French classrooms are taught that non-Muslims welcomed being conquered and invaded as\u00a0\u201ca blessing\u201d. Several textbooks, Lefebvre notes, claim \u201c[Non-Muslims] opened the gates of their city with the singers and the musicians began to play and paid the poll tax\u201d.\u201cIn textbooks, it appears that in Saudi after 632 everyone became Muslim like magic without pressure\u201d, she writes, asserting that so many under Muslim rule had only a \u201cchoice between conversion and death\u201d.By focusing on an idealised image of \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d under Muslim rule, Lefebvre blasts the narrative French schools project by completely neglecting to clarify the conditions under which non-Muslims were forced to live.She notes that \u201clike other ancient or medieval conquests\u201d the Islamisation of non-Muslim areas \u201cmeant dispossessing the indigenous of their sovereignty\u201d. For reference, the historian points to how when Christians in Toledo tried to resist this process they were mutilated and crucified by the invading forces.Further, she argues that to summarise the life of non-Muslims living under Islamic rule as being protected in return for a tax is completely dishonest.\u201cIf textbooks were willing to describe the humiliating terms of [non-Muslims living under Islamic rule]\u201d Lefebvre contends that it would be clear to students that Christians were \u201cstigmatised\u201d and made third class citizens in every respect under Muslim rule.Lefebvre notes that while textbooks devote whole pages to crimes committed by Europeans, Arab crimes are completely omitted. A clear example of this, she points out, is that textbooks neglect to mention Muslims\u2019 13 centuries-long enslavement of Africans.Contrasting Islamic slavery with the European slave trade, Lefebvre highlights the fact\u00a0that Arabs would castrate male captives and that the majority died as a result, which is why African slaves left little genetic trace in Muslim countries.The professor argues that it\u2019s wrong that the issue of Islamic slavery is completely absent from classrooms when children learn that the suffering of Africans throughout the centuries \u201ccomes down to the Transatlantic Slave Trade\u201d.Furthermore, she brings up the fact that it\u2019s impossible to find any history of Arab Muslims opposing slavery, \u201cunlike Europeans who fought for the abolition of this inhuman trade against their slave contemporaries\u201d.Lefebvre contends that the reason the government insists on the \u201cglorification\u201d of Islamic history in French classrooms is because multiculturalism \u201chas reached an identity point of tension close to breaking\u201d.The professor argues that textbooks\u2019 sanitising of Islam is counterproductive in that the issue of jihad is never addressed when from the religion\u2019s dawn it has served to justify \u201cimperialist conquest made of looting, killing and settlement\u201d.By employing such obvious double standards, Lefebvre says the history curriculum is failing in its duty to enlighten students, \u201cto make them informed citizens and to develop in them the critical spirit to analyse historical sources and not just learn [an agenda]\u201d.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n2927485886\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nPhiladelphia and NYC's mayors would respond by wondering what the possible motivation would be.

Yet the U.S. does not appear on the list of the Top 10 countries for firearm-related deaths. Those countries are:Honduras \u2013 67.18 per 100,000 residents per yearVenezuela \u2013 59.13Swaziland \u2013 37.16Guatemala \u2013 34.1Jamaica \u2013 30.72El Salvador \u2013 26.77Colombia \u2013 25.94Brazil \u2013 21.2Panama \u2013 15.11Uruguay \u2013 11.52The map and the accompanyingTelegrapharticle were drawn from theSmall Arms Surveyand the2012 Congressional Research Serrvice Report. AsBreitbart News previously reported, the CRS report shows privately owned firearms jumped from 192 million in the U.S. in 1994 to 310 million in 2009. At the same time, the\u00a0\u201cfirearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide\u201d rate\u2013which was 6.6 per 100,000 Americans in 1993\u2013fell to 3.6 per 100,000 by 2000.\u00a0Gun sales continued to surge and the \u201cfirearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide\u201d rate fell to 3.2 in 2011.Think about it\u2013as gun ownership rose, the murder rate plummeted in the U.S. Couple that with the fact that only one of the Top 10 countries for gun ownership is also in the Top 10 for firearm-related deaths\u2013Uruguay is number eight for gun ownership number 10 for gun deaths\u2013and the point is clear: More guns correlate with less crime.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the host ofBullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

The Lega Nord (Northern League) leader said accusations of populism are a \u201ccompliment\u201d and a \u201creason to be proud\u201d.\u201cI have a shirt [emblazoned on which are the] words \u2018I am a populist\u2019\u201d, herevealed, dismissingDie Welt\u2019s assertion that the term is an insult. \u201cOriginally, the term meant one who is close to the people, and speaks the common language,\u201d Salvini added.The mass sex attacks by mobs of migrants in Cologne last New Year \u201cwere in a sense a forewarning\u201d of the truck attack in Berlin that went unheeded, the Italian politician said.\u201cWe are being attacked and so must resolutely expel all those who have no right to live [in Europe]\u201d, he said, and argued that Germany\u2019s lacklustre response to the mass sexual assaults was a mistake. \u201cIf you want to live in peace, you have to prepare for war,\u201d the Lega Nord leader added.\u201cEurope is losing its values and identity, it\u2019s lacking security and has lost its sense of pride\u201d, Salvini said, and spoke of a \u201cculture war\u201d taking place on the continent.\u201cChristmas is Christmas because Jesus Christ was born. Why should we be ashamed of our traditions?\u201d the populist Italian said, and criticised how, in many Italian schools, Christmas festivities have been replaced with multicultural \u2018peace\u2019 festivals.Salvini said there should be no room for \u201cfanatics\u201d in Europe, and noted that \u201conly the law of Allah is valid\u201d for a number of Muslim migrants who reject secular laws. \u201cThe problem is not with individuals but the culture of Islam\u201d the anti-mass migration politician stated, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s backward, and not compatible with our society.\u201dNoting that 95 per cent of the new arrivals in Italy are economic migrants from Africa, Salvini said the money Italy is spending on putting them up in hotels is being \u201cthrown out of the window\u201d. Far better, he asserted, that the money go towards deals with African governments in which Italy invests in infrastructure in return for an end to migrant flows and easy return of illegal infiltrators.More than half a million migrants arrived in Italy by boat in 2016. In response, the globalist, social democratic government hasseizedhotels across the country, using them\u00a0to house migrants against the wishes of their owners.In November, Breitbart Londonreportedon how locals in Turin were left terrified when migrants squatting in the city\u2019s former Olympic village, now a hotbed of crime, took to the streets to protest \u201cracist Italians\u201d. Screaming threats and throwing projectiles, the migrants hailed the Bataclan massacre, in which 89 people were murdered, as a \u201crevenge of the excluded\u201d.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3081390690\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nA person is a fascist if he does't want his country invaded by a filthy, intolerant, violent cult that is raping and assaulting their host country's people as they drain the government coffers?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

He was then able to heave himself out of the frigid waters, but cut his legs badly while doing so.Skinner\u00a0caught up to four of the group, though\u00a0not his principal aggressor, who told him \u201cthe attack happened because I was white\u201d.The 38 year-old\u00a0then warned group\u00a0\u201cthat in the current political climate, such actions could have a negative effect on the Muslim Pakistani community\u201d and lectured them on \u201cthe positive aspects of Mohammed and Islam\u201d.Skinner lost his phone, keys, glasses and a memory stick where his college lessons were saved, and had to be treated in hospital for damage to his cheekbone, teeth and neck muscles.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMuslim cowards need a whole gang to sucker punch one white guy, no doubt the smallest they could find. \n\nBut the poor guy sounds like a hopeless liberal, so even this attack won't teach him anything about the nature of Islam.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Of those, 1,549\u2014or 60.1 percent\u2014are from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria, and Sudan,accordingto CNS News. Trump\u2019sorderbanned all refugee resettlement from Syria, froze all refugee resettlement for 120 days, and restricted all migrant travel from seven countries for 90 days. Over half, or 55 percent, of the 2,576 refugee arrivals are Muslim, including 99.6 percent of Syrian refugees.The regional judge\u2019s order did not affect Trump\u2019s halving of total refugee resettlement numbers, which hereducedto 50,000 for F2017.Terror-exporting countries combined with record levels of immigration into the U.S. present obvious national security problems. Foreign nationals from at least some of the countries named in Trump\u2019s executive order (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) have been convicted of terrorism charges in the U.S. A reportpublishedby now-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 Senate subcommitteerevealedat last 580 had been convicted on terrorism charges, including 380 foreign-born individuals:Out of the 580 names on the Department of Justice\u2019s list, at least 380 individuals were born abroad, at least 24 were initially admitted to the United States as refugees, and at least 33 had overstayed their visas. Out of the 198 U.S. citizens we were able to identify, at least 100 were naturalized citizens who initially came to the United States through one of our immigration programs. Of those born abroad, at least 62 were from Pakistan, 28 were from Lebanon, 22 were Palestinian, 21 were from Somalia, 20 were from Yemen, 19 were from Iraq, 16 were from Jordan, 17 were from Egypt, and 10 were from Afghanistan.That\u2019s 60 convicted foreign nationals from Somalia, Yemen, and Iraq alone. Furthermore, a study released on Feb. 11 by the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studiesrevealed 72 foreign nationalsfrom the seven countries named in Trump\u2019s executive order had been convicted in terror cases since Sept. 11, 2001. Dramatic attacks such as the Boston marathon bombing, committed by two Muslim refugee brothers, also highlight\u00a0the mortal risk refugee resettlement poses to American communities.Vetting Syrian refugees in particular is \u201cimpossible,\u201daccordingto former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.And as refugee resettlement watchdog Ann Corcoranwarns, there is nothing to prevent \u201csecondary migration,\u201d or refugees moving somewhere else in the U.S., bringing dysfunctional cultures, poverty, andcrimewith them. Third World migration has devastated communities like Lewiston, Maine, whereSomali drug dealershaunt a park where mothers once took their children to play, and Twin Falls, Idaho, where Sudanese and Iraqi refugees allegedly raped and urinated on a special-needs American child whilefilming the attack.Trump\u2019s refugee resettlement freeze is popular with voters: A Feb. 8 Morning Consult pollfound55 percent of voters supported Trump\u2019s executive order, including 82 percent of Republicans. A more detailed Feb. 8 McLaughlin & Associates poll found 57 percentsupportedhalting refugee resettlement in order to implement better screening procedures. A Feb. 2 Rasmussen Reports poll found 52 percent of votersfavoreda months-long freeze on all refugee resettlement until the government could better screen out terrorists, including 57 percent of young voters.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhy do so many judges lack judgement?

But in the early 1950s, several of the planes crashed. To prevent further loss of life, the fleet was grounded to identify the problem\u2019s source and correct it.The ultimate cause was attributed to a design flaw\u2014the square-cut windows led to fatigue cracks in the airframe. Resolving the problem required installing an oval-shaped window replacement.\u00a0 By accurately identifying and addressing the problem source, air travel once again was made safe for Brits.But today, another problem makes Britain unsafe for its citizens. Unfortunately in the aftermath of a March 23terrorist attackon Westminister Bridge, in which a Muslim jihadist ploughed a vehicle into a crowd of pedestrians, Britain\u2019s leadership refuses to identify the cause of the problem in order to appropriately resolve it.In an exchange in Parliament after the attack, Conservative MP Michael Tomlinson naivelyaskedPrime Minister Theresa May, \u201cIt is reported that what happened yesterday was an act of \u2018Islamic terror.\u2019 Will the Prime Minister agree with me that what happened was not Islamic, just as the murder of Airey Neave was not Christian, and that in fact both are perversions of religion?\u201dAs disturbing as Tomlinson\u2019s question was, May\u2019s response was even more so, saying, \u201cI absolutely agree, and it is wrong to describe this as \u2018Islamic terrorism;\u2019 it is \u2018Islamist terrorism;\u2019 it is a perversion of a great faith.\u201d Playing semantics, she ignored a chilling reality about Islam.May sought to make clear the ideology driving the Westminister Bridge attacker was not the religion of Islam, but a perversion of it.It was interesting Tomlinson chose to compare the March 23 terrorist attack to MPAirey Neave\u2019s 1979 assassination by an Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) car-bomb. He sought May\u2019s endorsement \u201cterrorism is terrorism,\u201d with neither act triggered by any rightful religious justification. At the time of Neave\u2019s murder, the U.K. had been turned into a virtualbattlefieldby the Irish Republican Army (IRA) as Catholic nationalistsopposedProtestant loyalists.But two important points were obfuscated by the two British politicians\u2019 exchange.First, as stated, mostactsof terrorism in the U.K., from the 1970s through 2001, shared a common IRA link. But by late 2001, IRA-related attacks disappeared, only to be replaced by numerous terrorist attacks with a different link\u2014the vast majority undertaken by adherents to Islam.Second, as these terrorist acts only involved one or two Muslim attackers, the Brits, as do many Western authorities, sought to dismiss any linkage to Islam as the source of the perpetrator\u2019s motivation. Instead, they chose to identify an attacker as a \u201clone wolf\u201d perverting the religion or claiming the terrorist\u2019s motivationmay neverbe known\u2014which was done in this most recent case.Such dismissal of the motivational rationale is disingenuous. It promotes a na\u00efve belief\u2014i.e., Islam is not violent, therefore, any Muslim resorting to violencemust not beone. But this ignores Islam\u2019s long historical record of violence.Proponents of peaceful Islam fail to ask critical questions:If Islam is peaceful and if those acting violently in its name pervert it, why has Islam experienced a 1400-year storied past of brutal violence? Should not such a history of Islam cause non-Muslims concern something inherently is wrong with the religion? Is it not logical, therefore, non-Muslims be concerned Islam has existed for a thousand plus years and continues to exist as a burning ember, igniting generations of followers into action believing they rightly and justly are doing what the Quranmandatesthey do\u2014impose their religion upon all others, using force if necessary?What is incredulous is Western blindness, created by an era of outrageous political correctness, in failing to do what was done over six decades ago to save passenger lives in the aviation industry by identifying a problem and then acting to resolve it.The danger today is we refuse appropriately to challenge an ideology promoting hatred, intolerance and violence, simply because it is packaged as a religion. How many \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks by Muslims must we witness before reason dictates we acknowledge a pattern exists, linking such acts to Islam? Reason dictates, based upon Islam\u2019s 1400-yearhistory of violence, we conclude we are not talking about a perversion of Islam causing terrorism\u2014but about Islam itself.Sadly, many of those declaring Islam peaceful have failed even to read the Quran to verify, for themselves, it is as they preach. Ironically, they simply give Islam a free pass, as an established religion, to co-exist with all other religions. But they fail to understand religious co-existence is not on Islam\u2019s mind. As the Westminister Bridge attacker and those before him represent, Islam\u2019s mandate is domination.Those accepting Islam as peaceful do other religions a grave injustice. By failing to read the Quran, non-Muslims fail to grasp Islam\u2019s reality\u2014i.e., our very existence iscontraryto theirs with the Quran mandating their religion alone survive. It is an end to be imposed by force by Muslims if not embraced voluntarily by non-believers.There is an uninhabited island,Gough, located in the South Atlantic Ocean, that has been a breeding ground for the albatross for centuries. The bird population has thrived, never knowing predators. This changed recently.Several years ago, mice\u2014possibly from a passing ship\u2014made their way to the island. They now thrive by feasting upon albatross chicks. Amazingly, conservationists report, the mice attack live chicks\u2014outweighing them 250 fold\u2014while the chicks\u2019 parents do nothing to fend them off.Environmentalists claim the parents are \u201cecologically na\u00efve\u201d\u2014i.e., having never known predators before, they simply are blind to a threat to their very existence standing right before them. As a result, concerns exist, over time, the albatross may become endangered.The question we need consider is whether democracy eventually will go the way of the albatross as a generation of Western parents, ecologically na\u00efve about Islam\u2019s threat to their existence, fail to save their own \u201cchicks.\u201dLt.

She promised her supporters they would \u201cnever get used to terrorism\u201d saying she would bring \u201cIslamist fundamentalism to its knees\u201d.Reaching out to what the Front National leader calls \u201cforgotten France\u201d, Le Pen spoke at a rally in an open-sided barn to nearly 1,000 people in the small\u00a0Eure-et-Loir town, which has a population of just 1,200, on Monday.\u201cThe other candidates are only in big cities,\u201d shesaidwhilst taking selfies with the eager members of the crowd. \u201cI have been meeting in small villages and meeting French people who have never seen a candidate come to see them. It is my place, I am here among the French people who I want to defend.\u201dFocusing on\u00a0rural affairs in her address, Le Pen also drove home her national agenda of neutrality, secularism, and security.\u201cOn security, it will be zero tolerance,\u201d shesaid.\u00a0\u201cI will never ask the French to get used to terrorism. I will \u00a0bring Islamist fundamentalism to its knees!\u201dPromising to put \u2018France First\u2019, Le Penaffirmed:\u00a0\u201cWith me at the head of the State, never will a stowaway be treated better than a Frenchman in his own country.\u201dMs. Le Pen also criticisedpro-mass migrationEn Marche candidate Macron, who during a speech in Marseilles Saturday attacked Ms. Le Pen, her party, and by inference, her supporters.During arallyin the crime-plagued Mediterranean port city, where 30 to 40 per cent of the population are Muslim, Macron declared: \u201cLet us drive away from this campaign, far from the country, the party of hatred, that of contempt, of the withdrawal, and all of those who make us so ashamed.\u201dCalling his words \u201ccontemptuous\u201d, the Front National party leader said: \u201cI can no longer bear to hear Mr. Macron say that you, you patriots, should be driven out of your own country.\u201d\u201cWe do not insult the people like that, Mr. Macron,\u201d said Ms. Le Pen, to which the audience applauded and chanted: \u201cWe are at home.\u201d\u201cHow can Mr. Macron make such abject remarks towards the patriots and lovers of France that you are, that we are. He has insulted France by saying that she has committed a crime against humanity in Algeria.\u201dLe Pen was referencing comments made by Macron in February when he implied a collective national guilt forstatingthat French\u00a0colonisation of Algeria was a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d \u2013 a comment that cost him five voter intention points in the days that followed.\u201cPatriotism is not a dead idea,\u201d she added, \u201cOn the contrary, it is the crucible of our future, of our dreams.\u201dCurrent pollingsuggestslikely voter intention puts Marcon just 0.5 per cent ahead of Le Pen (26 per cent/25.5 per cent) for first round voting. Le Pen, who addressed young voters inBordeauxon Sunday, is polling equal with Macron at 24 per cent with 18-24-year-olds.The first round of the presidential election occurs on 23 April, with the run-off set to take place on 7 May.A supporter ofcandidatefor the presidential election Marine LePen,wears a t-shirt with a portrait of U.S President Donald Trump during a meeting in La BazocheGouet, central France, Monday, April 3, 2017.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nFunny that the only one in France with the balls to confront Islamism is a woman.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The 65 year-old is reportedly in serious financial trouble, has not had a hit in nearly five years, and has not won anyone an Oscar in that same amount of time.Harvey Weinstein is no longer useful to anyone, so scores are being settled. If he was still useful, his predations would be allowed to continue unchallenged.Moreover, outlets like Deadline,VarietyandThe Hollywood Reporterwill not make any advertising money from Weinstein. Oscar season is Black Friday to these outlets. Weinstein no longer fills these coffers.The same is not true for Affleck.Not only is two-time Oscar-winner Affleck one of the hottest directors around, he is Hollywood\u2019s freakin\u2019 BATMAN \u2014 he is the tentpole holding up a tentpole, the Warner Brothers\u2019Justice Leaguefranchise, and what is probably a$250 million to $300 million investmentthat will hit thousands of screens in less than five weeks.Does anyone believe Warners is not leaning hard on these entertainment news outlets to cover up these allegations, is not using all thatJustice Leagueadvertising money as both carrot and stick?And let us never forget that Affleck is a leftwinger, a lifelong Democrat. And when you think \u201ccorrectly\u201d there is nothing you cannot do, nothing our media will not cover up. \u00a0Just ask Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton.Bottom line: the same mentality that allowed Harvey Weinstein to get away with what he did for three decades, is still alive, kicking and protecting Buttman.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC.Follow his Facebook Pagehere.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3564302049\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat's only one of the commonalities.

Lee\u2013To Be \u2018Welcoming\u2019\n\n# News comment article:\nAn Episcopal church in Virginia that counted as members both our first president, George Washington, as well as Confederate General Robert E. Lee, will remove the historical plaques memorializing both figures in order to be more \u201cwelcoming.\u201dThe vestry of Christ Church in Alexandria\u2019s unanimous decision was announced in an October 26 letter to members firstreportedby the Republican Standard website. Theletterinforms churchgoers that the plaques are to be removed to prevent people feeling \u201cunsafe\u201d in the sanctuaary.Hebrews 13:2 says, \u201cDo not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.\u201d Christ Church lives into this call, feeding the hungry with our Lazarus ministry, welcoming the stranger in our refugee ministry, and inviting all to worship with us. The plaques in our sanctuary make some in our presence feel unsafe or unwelcome. Some visitors and guests who worship with us choose not to return because they receive an unintended message from the prominent presence of the plaques.The letter, signed by 13 members of the governing council of the church, goes on to insist that the eras in which the two famed men lived are \u201cmuch different than our own.\u201d The letter continued:We understand that both Washington and Lee lived in times much different than our own and that each man, in addition to his public persona, was a complicated human being, and like all of us, a child of God. Today, the legacy of slavery and of the Confederacy is understood differently than it was in 1870. For some, Lee symbolizes the attempt to overthrow the Union and to preserve slavery. Today our country is trying once again to come to grips with the history of slavery and the subsequent disenfranchisement of people of color.\u201cMany in our congregation feel a strong need for the church to stand clearly on the side of \u2018All are welcome \u2014 no exceptions,'\u201d officials insisted about their whitewashing of church history. \u201cBecause the sanctuary is a worship space, not a museum, there is no appropriate way to inform visitors about the history of the plaques or to provide additional context except for the in-person tours provided by our docents.\u201dChurch officials went on to explain that both plaques are being removed because the two occupy opposite\u00a0areas of the sanctuary and would \u201cunbalance\u201d the aesthetic look of the church if only the Robert E. Lee plaque were to be removed.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter@warnerthuston.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3589221973\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nShhhhh.....\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The future policy with the U.S. would be limited to \u2018cooperation for cooperation\u2019 and relations based on equality.Pakistani officials are expected to reach out to Islamabad\u2019s allies, namely China, \u201cto take them into confidence,\u201d notes the news outlet.Speficially, Islamabad is going to \u201cspeed up the process of implementing its strategy for increasing diplomatic, trade and other relations with China, Russia and other countries,\u201d notes theTribune.According to the Pentagon, the Afghanistan-Pakistan region ishometo the \u201chighest regional concentration of terrorist groups in the world,\u201d including the Taliban, al-Qaeda, their ally the Haqqani Network, and their alleged rival the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).In its most recent assessment of the war in Afghanistan, raging since October 2001, the Pentagon acknowledged that Pakistan continues to serve as a safe haven for the Haqqani Network, considered \u201cthe greatest threat\u201d facing Americans and their allies in Afghanistan.Beijing has longconsideredIslamabad a strategic partner in South Asia despite thegrowingIslamic terrorist threat stemming from Pakistan and to a lesser extent neighboring Afghanistan.Early last month, Chinawarnedits citizens in Pakistan against potential terrorist attacks.China\u2019s largest province, the autonomous Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang,sharesa border with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Afghanistan.Many of the Islamic terrorist attacks on Chinese soil have beenlinkedto Uighur (or Uyghur) Muslims from Xinjiang who are known to train and operate in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan.Nevertheless, Chinacontinuesto provide financial and military support to Pakistan.Both Pakistan and China consider U.S. ally India to be their regional rival.The majority of U.S. militarycasualtiesin Afghanistan have taken place in provinces at or near the country\u2019sborderwith Pakistan.Furthermore, most jihadi strongholds in Afghanistan, including those belonging to the Afghan Taliban, al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Haqqani Network, sit on the Pakistani border.Nonetheless, Pakistan reportedly told U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis during his recent visit to Islamabad that Pakistan would not accept any dictation from the United States to enhance its efforts against jihadists in its region.Sinceunveilinghis South Asia strategy, which primarily focuses on Afghanistan, President Trump has been trying topressurePakistan into no longer providing sanctuary to terrorist groups, to no avail.The recent Pentagon assessment determined that Pakistan continues to allow terrorists to operate on its soil.Afghanistan and Pakistan have long accused one another of harboring terrorists.The Pakistani Taliban or Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) \u2014 an independent group from its Afghan counterpart \u2014\u00a0is known to plan attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan.\u201cSanctuary on the Pakistani side and presence on the Afghan side remain security challenges for both countries and pose a threat to regional security and stability,\u201d conceded the Pentagon.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nA \"great effort\"?

He said if we don\u2019t like it we should take our kids out of school on an unauthorised absence,\u201d a mother who wished to remain anonymous told the newspaper.\u201cThere are books dotted around the school about sexuality, they learn a lot about LGBTQ+ in school and that\u2019s fine.\u201cBut I just think it\u2019s gone too far now and the head is using his position of power and influence to push this information on the children,\u201d she added.https://twitter.com/CherylWarner77/status/967539425709260801The curriculum of Parson Street Primary School is \u00a0\u2018Live and Learn\u2019, with the syllabus focusing on \u201cpreparing children to live in an ever-changing and diverse world\u201d, according to theBristol Post.The academy was the first school in Bristol to be awarded Gold Practice Status by Educate & Celebrate, a nationwide programme whichdemandsschools inject content promoting LGBT lifestyles in everything they do.A number of mothers also accused headteacher Jamie Barry of being \u201cvague\u201d about which men will be attending the school on March 1, and what stories they plan to read.\u201cOne of the drag queens refers to herself as Bristol\u2019s Resident S***, these are children of between four and 11 \u2014 they don\u2019t need to be exposed to that,\u201d a mother remarked.\u201cThey are adult entertainers, I just don\u2019t see how that is age appropriate.\u201dDrag Queen Story Time founder Tom Canham said while he \u201cappreciates the concerns of parents\u201d who fear the event will not be suitable for children, he argued that the group\u2019s stable of cross-dressing men \u201care at the top of their field in their art form, and like all performance artists are able to tailor their performance to the audience that they work with.\u201d\u201cI wholeheartedly believe they should learn about these ideas. When you introduce tolerance at a young age they take it on board. Many of these children will not be LGBT themselves but they will at some point come into contact with someone who is,\u201d he told the Bristol Post.\u201cWe have an opportunity to provide our children with a better world in which to grow up, free from fear of rejection, or abuse, for being who they are \u2013 and Drag Queen Story Time is proud to be working with fantastic organisations all across the country to help make that a reality.\u201dMore than 2,000 children have now been exposed to the project, which holds sessions at taxpayer-funded schools, community centres, and libraries at which children learn songs about \u201ctransgender\u201d teddy bears as the drag queens teach about homophobia, misogyny, and racism through reading books which promote \u2018queer\u2019 and LGBT lifestyles.The organisation was able to go country-wide after a crowdfunding campaign helped Canham buy books and pay for Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks to enable DQST transvestites to hold sessions at nursery schools.As Breitbart Londonpreviously reported, the London Early Years Foundation (LEYF) invited DQST to hold events as \u2018queer role models\u2019 for three and four-year-old toddlers at several of their nurseries over the winter, with a view to rolling the scheme out across all the foundation\u2019s 37 sites.Follow Breitbart London on Facebook:Breitbart London\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3775355484\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSome did.

Simpson \u2018Confessed\u2019 to Murder in 2006 Interview\n\n# News comment article:\nFox aired what it described as O.J. Simpson\u2019s \u201cLost Confession?\u201d Sunday night, but TMZ\u2019s Harvey Levin has removed the question mark and is flat-out declaring the 2006 interview a full confession.The TMZ headlinereads, \u201cO.J. Simpson Confesses to Murder.\u201d Obviously, Levin is not buying the interview in the way Simpson advertised it, as a cynical cash grab where he \u201chypothetically\u201d recounts how the murder would have gone down \u201cif\u201d he did it.Levin explains, \u201cHe confessed. He said he was speaking hypothetically but very shortly into it, especially describing the night of the murders, he lapses into the first person.\u201dLevin acknowledges that Simpson goes to \u201cgreat pains\u201d to use the word \u201chypothetically,\u201d but once Simpson starts to talk about the actual murder \u2014 that began with a confrontation with his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman, a young man who was reportedly there to return some glasses Nicole\u2019s mother had left at his restaurant \u2014 Simpson drops the use of the word \u201chypothetical\u201d and uses the word \u201cI\u201d to describe his anger.\u201cSo all of a sudden, he\u2019s giving all this great detail,\u201d Levin explains. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, he says, \u2018I grabbed the knife\u2019 \u2026 So he confesses.\u201d\u201cThe grossest thing I think I\u2019ve seen in \u2026 this whole saga,\u201d Levin adds, \u201c[Simpson] is describing what he did, what he did, what he did; all of a sudden, it clicks in his head that \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m suddenly talking in the first person\u2019 and then he snaps and says, \u2018I should be talking hypothetically.\u2019 And then he just breaks into this belly laugh.\u201d Levin explains his disgust, \u201cSo he\u2019s just confessed to the murder of the mother of his children and his reaction is a belly laugh.\u201dHere is Levin\u2019s full statement:Here is a clip from the 2006 interview that aired Sunday:Simpson not only goes into the details explained by Levin, he goes so far as to explain where the infamous bloody glove came from. In his \u201chypothetical\u201d story, it was his glove, not something planted by police. He said he removed it to take the murder weapon, a knife, from a friend who was with him at the scene, someone the disgraced former running back calls \u201cCharlie.\u201dFollow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC.Follow his Facebook Pagehere.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3800852222\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnd the worst of those who know he is guilty are willfully blind blacks, and the racist blacks who loudly cheered the acquittal.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

And of course, there are all those gun manufacturers and retailers. So\u00a0 it\u2019s simply not possible to say that corporate America speaks with one voice on guns, or on any other subject.Still, as anyone following the gun debate knows, Hogg and his fellow March For Our Lives-ers\u2014students andadult benefactorsalike\u2014have considerable momentum, including in corporate America.The reality of that momentum became apparent last week, when a single tweet from Laura Ingraham boomeranged on the fiery Fox News host.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Ingrahamtweetedmockingly about Hogg\u2019s college-acceptance prospects.For his part, within hours, Hogg responded with tweets of his own, calling upon advertisers to drop their sponsorship of Ingraham\u2019s show. And sure enough, some sponsors did just that.Soon, Ingraham, obviously feeling the heat, apologized. And yet Hogg refused to accept Ingraham\u2019s apology, and so the anti-Ingraham effort continues; as of this writing,Hogg is still on the offensive, Twitter-wise, and14 advertisers have fled, even as Ingraham suddenly announced that she was taking a vacation next week. (In the meantime, the fact thatHogg himself had said far more intemperate things, including usingprofane language, has gone mostly unnoticed.)So this media exchange counts as a clear victory for Hogg & Co. He and his allies struck at Ingraham and Fox where it really hurts\u2014in their bottom line. Speaking grandly of his establishment friends, Hogg also said to CNN on Friday, \u201cIt is important that we stand together as corporate and civic America to take action against these people and show them they cannot push us around, especially when all we\u2019re trying to do here is save lives.\u201dOf course, some will argue, with plenty of evidence, that the flight of corporate advertisers from Ingraham and Fox\u2014as well as the distancing from the NRA\u2014has been the result of a carefully coordinated pressure campaign run by politicos in Washington, DC, New York, and Los Angeles, not by students from Broward County, FL.So this March 30 Breitbart Newsheadline, \u201cSoros-Funded Groups Fueling Laura Ingraham Advertiser Boycott,\u201d counts as what might be called apredictable surprise. In that piece, author Aaron Klein detailed the doings of Media Matters for America, funded by George Soros\u2014and many other like-minded fatcats\u2014while noting that Media Matters boasts some 80 employees, and an annual budget of about $13 million. That much throw-weight, of course, can have a lot of impact. And so it might never be possible to untangle the role that Media Matters and like-minded pressure groups have played in pushing at least some parts of corporate America toward a more pro-gun-control position.Yet undeniably, some gun-control activism comes fromwithincorporate America itself. For instance, on March 2,BlackRock, the investment behemoth boasting $5 trillion in assets, announced that it was studying the possibility of using its financial muscle to influence gun issues. In fact, BlackRock\u2019s reach could potentially extend to virtually all aspects of gun manufacturing, financing, advertising\u2014and boycotting.As BlackRock CEO Larry Fink declared,\u201cCompanies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers and the communities in which they operate.\u201d\u00a0 And he added, companies must become more adept at \u201cunderstanding the societal impact of your business.\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue with Fink\u2019s basic point about the desirability of social benefits, even as, of course, many might dispute Fink\u2019s definition of those benefits.Of course, a synonym for Fink\u2019s \u201csocietal impact\u201d is the more familiar phrase\u201ccorporate social responsibility\u201d (CSR).CSR is a catch-all term for just about anything a private firm might do, and yet in recent years, it seems that much CSR activism has been focused on selected issues, often having to do with gender and diversity\u2014such as, for example, theboycott of North Carolinaover its bathroom bill. And now, these days, we can also add gun control.To be sure, it\u2019s hardly the case that corporate America has become a hotbed of leftism; there aren\u2019t many Bernie Sanders supporters in the C-suites. And yet at the same time, it seems evident that Clinton-Obama-type cultural liberalism has a firm foothold.Not surprisingly, some on the right have reacted negatively to this liberalism. For example, on March 25, Derek Hunter, a veteran conservative writing for the rightistTownhall.com, headlined his piece\u201cOur Corporate Masters.\u201dHunter expressed himself sharply: \u201cIn the corporate world . . . they are trying to control what we can buy, what we can watch, what we can read, how we can spend our own money, what we can say, and how we live our lives.\u201dSome might insist that corporations mostly just want to make money, and yet for some corporations, notably in Silicon Valley, making money seems to have been conflated with making a statement\u2014and yes, shaping our lives.Exhibit A is\u2014you guessed it\u2014Facebook. And a March 29headlineinPoliticotells the tale of the right-wing reaction: \u201cConservative outlets take on Facebook.\u201d Those conservative outlets, of course, include Breitbart News; in the words of editor-in-chiefAlex Marlow, \u201cBig tech is the biggest threat to free speech \u2026 Never has so much power been concentrated in the hands of so few people.\u201dThe Romans Had a Name for ItPerhaps Virgil can add some perspective\u2014the wisdom, one might say, of an ancient.So if we wish to ponder corporate social responsibility today, we might first take a closer look at that \u201cc-word,\u201dcorporation. As we shall see, a corporation has been, and will continue to be, highly variable; the only constant is that people operate them\u2014and people, too, are highly variable. Come to think of it, over time, they are 100 percent variable.The word \u201ccorporation\u201d dates back to the 15th century; it\u2019sdefined as\u201cpersons united in a body for some purpose.\u201d The root of the word, of course, goes back even further, to the the Latincorpus, or body, which also gives us the modern word \u201ccorpse.\u201dThese days, we likely think of a corporation as a private for-profit company. And yet at the same time, there are public corporations, such as theCorporation for Public Broadcasting, and there are also private non-profit corporations, such as theCarnegie Corporation.In other words, a corporation is just a group of people organized to do something, with a twist. And that twist is this: The presumed goal for the corporation is to keep doing its thing well beyond the lifetime of any individual\u2014perhaps even forever. As the 18th century juristSir William Blackstonewrote in his magisterialCommentaries, \u201cCorporations \u2026 are artificial persons \u2026 established for preserving in perpetual succession certain rights.\u201d Blackstone observed that the legal structure of a corporation is, in fact, a \u201cbody politic.\u201d He added that if such a legal structure were to be conferred only on \u201cnatural persons,\u201d then the enterprise \u201cwould fail in [the] process of time\u201d\u2014that is, with the inevitable death of the participants.Indeed, any conscious entity that lasts longer than the blink of history\u2019s eye is a kind of corporation\u2014that is, all governments, all religions, all universities, all militaries. Thus we see the germ of that venerable idea in the name of theUnited States Marine Corps, as well as theCorps of Cadets at West Point.So we quickly realize that a corporation of any kind is not much different\u2014no better, no worse\u2014than the people in it. To put that another way, corporations are simply a subset of human nature, for good or ill. And so the same is true for CSR; corporate social responsibility is just another manifestation of the personalities within a company\u2014often, in fact, more so than the owners of that company, who tend to be absentee, or even algorithmic. And of course, the people within a corporation are guided by whatever external laws and pressures they might confront.Don\u2019t Mourn, Organize!It\u2019s that last point, \u201cexternal laws and pressures,\u201d that we might dwell upon.Today, if folks aren\u2019t happy about the status quo of CSR and corporate activism, and they wish to see change, then they have no choice but to get active themselves.Such activism can work for the right, even today, even in this cultural climate: Just on March 28,Walmartannounced that it was pullingCosmopolitanmagazine from its checkout lanes. The retail giant acknowledged that it was responding to public pressure, specifically from the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (a conservative group, founded in 1962 asMorality in Media).Indeed, the right might take useful inspiration from the left: specifically, the reputed last words of the legendary labor organizer,Joe Hill, who said to his followers in his dying moments, \u201cDon\u2019t mourn\u2014organize!\u201d You see, it does little good to simply lament thetears of things\u2014that makes forgreat poetry, but not much else.If every corporation, of every kind, is made up of people, then every corporation is subject to political pressure; that is,organizedpressure. As the greatAristotleexplains, man is azoon politikon\u2014a political animal. To put that another way, everything we do in the public square has a political component to it.So if the right feels that the left is winning\u2014and it clearlyiswinning, at least on key cultural matters\u2014then the right had better improve its act.\u00a0 And in this case, \u201cact\u201d is short for bothactivismandaction.You see, politics can reshape anything and everything in our national life. Politics can change the risk-reward calculation of companies that might, or might not, place advertising with Laura Ingraham, or with any other conservative. Politics can change the regulatory climate surrounding Wall Streeters such as BlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink. Politics can change the judiciary\u2014it can even change, through amendment, our revered Constitution. In other words, every last aspect of today\u2019s CSR is subject to change,ifthere\u2019s the organized and concerted desire to change it.Indeed, if one considers that the twin peaks of today\u2019s private sector\u2014that is, Wall Street and Silicon Valley\u2014are both firmly in the hands of the cultural left, then it becomes all the more desirable, even necessary, for the right to stake its claim to effective national politics. That is, conservatives ought to controlsomethingthat can affect Wall Street and Silicon Valley.After all, it\u2019s an article of faith on the right that most Americans agree with conservatives, at least quietly, on many critical issues. If so, then it\u2019s time to prove it. It\u2019s time for the Silent Majority to become the Vocal Majority. And theEffectiveMajority. And if the path to majoritarianism requires some adjustment in the conservative message, well, so be it. Acting with calibrated deliberation in pursuit of a shared goal is, of course, the essence of politics. Everything else, no matter how heartfelt, is just posturing.David Hogg and his Big Friends have won this round. Yet only time will tell who wins round two, and round three, and on and on. After all, just as politics is all-surrounding, so, too, it is never-ending.Yes, it\u2019s true what they say: There are no final victories. And yet still, always, victory is better than defeat.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n3834108951\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYou are definitely one of the dumber trolls today.

It can be seen below:Israel\u2019s Kan public broadcaster later found the teen, Adam Armush, and interviewed him near his home. He said:It happened right here, next to my home, when I was on my way to the train station with my friend. The truth is, I\u2019m surprised something like this happened to me. I\u2019m still in shock.We came out of our home, my friend and I, wearing our kippas, and walked down the street. We weren\u2019t talking with anyone else. Three people came from over there \u2026 and started cursing us from over there. We didn\u2019t talk to anyone, didn\u2019t answer them. So when they kept cursing us, my friend asked them to stop cursing, and that got them angry. So one of them ran at me. I immediately felt it was important to film, because I didn\u2019t think we could catch him before police arrived. I wanted to give police something to go on.According to the Judisches Forum fur Demokratie und gegen Antisemitismus (JFDA), which monitors anti-Semitism in Germany, local police have opened an investigation into the attack.\u201cJust because he wore a kippa, a young Jewish man was reportedly attack on April 17th, 2018, at Helmholtzplatz in Berlin\u2019s Prenzlauer Berg,\u201d the group said in a statement.Reports of a rise in anti-Semitism are increasing across Germany,\u00a0with the Homeland Ministry recently agreeing with proposals from Jewish leaders to strip anti-Semitic migrants of their right to remain in the country.Deputy Homeland Minister Stephan Mayer backed the chairman of Germany\u2019s Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, on the matter asreportedby Breitbart London.He added: \u201cThose people thereby oppose the core values and beliefs of our democratic system.\u201dIn January, CDU and CSU politiciansprepareda new draft bill paving the way for the deportation of anti-Semites, stating that \u201cabsolute acceptance of Jewish life\u201d is a \u201cbenchmark for successful integration\u201d in Germany.Germany has also been forced toappointa new special commissioner to tackle the issue of anti-Semitism, and newly-arrived migrants have beenwarnedthey must reject bigoted views.Follow Simon Kent on Twitter:Follow @SunSimonKentor e-mail to: skent@breitbart.com\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWrong reaction.

Still more messages were revealed in the 500-plus pagereportreleased yesterday by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.One section of the report focuses on Page\u2019s special liaison role between the team investigating Clinton, known as the \u201cMidyear team\u201d, and McCabe. The method of communication resulted in information not being filtered through other FBI officials, and according to the report Page acknowledged that some within the FBI were upset by this setup.The IG report found that Page, McCabe and Strzok\u2019s circle of contact cut out two top FBI officials from the chain of communication, namely E.W. Priestap, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division and Michael Steinbach, who served as executive assistant director of the agency\u2019s national security branch.The report reveals:Lisa Page, who was Special Counsel to McCabe, became involved in the Midyear investigation after McCabe became the Deputy Director in February 2016.\u00a0 Page told the OIG that part of her function was to serve as a liaison between the Midyear team and McCabe.\u00a0 Page acknowledged that her role upset senior FBI officials, but told the OIG that McCabe relied on her to ensure that he had the information he needed to make decisions, without it being filtered through multiple layers of management.Several witnesses told the OIG that Page circumvented the official chain of command, and that Strzok communicated important Midyear case information to her, and thus to McCabe, without Priestap\u2019s or Steinbach\u2019s knowledge.\u00a0 McCabe said that he was aware of complaints about Page, and that he valued her ability to \u201cspot issues\u201d and bring them to his attention when others did not do so.The IG report, meanwhile, contained previously unknown text messages between Page and Strzok in which the pair discussed stopping Trump from becoming president.\u201c[Trump\u2019s not ever going to become president, right? Right!?\u201d Page texted Strzok in one August 2016 message.\u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok responded.Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The district has been reliably Republican for over 30 years and Democrats saw an opportunity for a pick up.As of now, though, with 100% of precincts reporting, Republican Troy Balderson enjoys a fairly comfortable1,754 vote leadover Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor. There are some 8,000 provisional ballots left to count, but it is unlikely those can put O\u2019Connor over the top.The Green Candidate in the race, Joe Manchik, won 1,127 votes, so even if Milano\u2019s absurd conspiracy theory was true, those evil Russians would not have made the difference.Milano\u2019s anti-science conspiracy theory also puts on a display of her ignorance as to how democracy works.To begin with, despite unending inquiries for almost two years now, there is no proof the hideous Russians, who have been meddling in our elections for nearly 100 years, changed a single vote in 2016.Look at Manchik.

Hewrote:\u201cThe reaction against me was extreme, yet it was far from exceptional. On campus, the subject of gender is now off limits for those who fail to fall into line with the new orthodoxy: that being a man or a woman is fluid.\u201cAnyone who says otherwise is liable to find themselves hounded into silence.\u201dHe added: \u201cAt Durham university, as well as at other universities, it would be easy to think that the importance of never causing offence is all that matters.\u201cThis remains the case even when upholding this focus gets in the way of facts, or the right of people to hold differing views on contentious subjects, such as gender.\u201cThis is why my innocuous tweet resulted in such a fierce reaction. I was told that the reason for my firing from the student journal was because I had \u2018belittled trans experiences\u2019.\u201cThe explanation for my removal as editor of Bubble was worse: my position at the magazine, I was told, required me to be impartial. Being impartial, however, requires having no views at all.

Circuit Court case,\u00a0Sherrill\u00a0v. H. Knight,saidthe White House did not provide Acosta \u201cdue process\u201d in revoking the pass.\u00a0Kelly, a Trump appointee, made clear that the ruling was not based on whether the White House violated Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights. Rather, CNN and the White House correspondentdemonstrateda likelihood of success in arguing that their Fifth Amendment rights to due process were breached, the judge said.Further, the judgestatedthe fact that CNN has other pass holders does not reduce the level of \u201charm\u201d towards the network\u2019s White House correspondent. The judge alsoremarkedon Acosta \u201claying hands\u201d on a White House intern, calling the characterization \u201clikely untrue\u201d and\u00a0\u201cpartly based on evidence of questionable accuracy.\u201dNotably, Kelly,referringto his ruling as \u201cvery limited\u201d in nature, left the door open for the White House to revoke Acosta\u2019s credentials, granted due process is respected.\u201cI just want to say something very briefly and that is I want to thank all of my colleagues in the press who supported us this week and I want to thank the judge for the decision he made today. Let\u2019s get back to work,\u201d Acosta said as he exited the courthouse.CNN attorney Ted Boutrossaidthe news network is \u201cextremely pleased with the ruling today,\u201d adding that it is \u201ca great day for the First Amendment and journalism.\u201dIn a separate statement, CNNsaid:\u00a0\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days. Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201dResponding to the ruling, the White Houseannouncedit will \u201ctemporarily reinstate\u201d Acosta\u2019s pass and said it will \u201cfurther develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.\u201dOn Thursday,\u00a0Kelly delayed his decision on whether to order the Trump administration to return the White House press credentials of Acosta.Kelly heard arguments Wednesday from lawyers representing CNN and the Justice Department. The news network was seeking an immediate restraining order that would force the White House to hand back Acosta\u2019s credentials, which grant reporters access into the 18-acre complex.Acosta hasclashed repeatedlywith President Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in briefings over the last two years. However, the dynamic devolved into a near-shouting match during a combative press conference last week following midterm elections in which Republicans lost control of the House.Acosta refused to give up a microphone when the president said he didn\u2019t want to hear anything more from him. President Trump referred to Acosta a \u201crude, terrible person.\u201dHours later, The White House announced that Acosta\u2019s White House access would be revoked.The CNN lawsuitcalledthe revocation \u201can unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President\u2019s point of view.\u201dJustice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that Acosta was guilty of \u201cinappropriate grandstanding\u201d and deserved to lose his access over \u201chis refusal to comply with the general standards of a press conference.\u201dBurnham said that the White House is essentially President Trump\u2019s home and office and that he has some right to decide who can and can\u2019t be there. \u201cThere\u2019s no First Amendment right to access the White House grounds,\u201d Burnham said. Further, Burnham also pointed out that CNN has dozens of other staffers with White House credentials, so excluding Acosta would not harm the network\u2019s coverage.The network\u2019s lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, contended that Acosta was being singled out for his White House coverage, not his alleged rudeness during a news conference.\u201cThe White House has made very clear that they don\u2019t like the content of the reporting by CNN and Jim Acosta,\u201d Boutrous said. \u201cRudeness really is a code word for \u2018I don\u2019t like you being an aggressive reporter.\u2019\u201dPresident Trump, in an interview published Wednesday,toldThe Daily Caller that \u201cguys like Acosta\u201d were \u201cbad for the country. \u2026 He\u2019s just an average guy who\u2019s a grandstander who\u2019s got the guts to stand up and shout.\u201dA number of news organizations, including Fox News, CBS News, and NBC, announced their intention to file amicus briefs with the court in support of CNN.

The time for impeachment proceedings is now.\u201dJohn Bonifaz, the co-founder and president of the advocacy group Free Speech For People, joined Tlaib in composing the piece. Bonifaz is well-known for co-authoringThe Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump.In theDetroit Free Pressarticle, both Tlaib and Bonifaz argued that members of Congress\u00a0\u201cdo not need to wait\u201d until Mueller\u2019s investigation is complete before attempting to impeach the president:Whether the president was directly involved in a conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere with the 2016 election remains the subject of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. But we do not need to wait on the outcome of that criminal investigation before moving forward now with an inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives on whether the president has committed impeachable \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d against the state: abuse of power and abuse of the public trust. Each passing day brings new damage to the countless people hurt by this lawless president\u2019s actions. We cannot undo the trauma that he is causing to our people, and this nation. Those most vulnerable to his administration\u2019s cruelty are counting on us to act\u2014act to remove the president and put this country on a path to true justice.Tlaib and Bonifaz concluded the op-ed by straying from the moderate Democrats\u2019 argument that impeachment of the president is unwarranted and dangerous in current times.\u201cWe are also now hearing the dangerous claim that initiating impeachment proceedings against this president is politically unwise and that, instead, the focus should now shift to holding the president accountable via the 2020 election. Such a claim places partisan gamesmanship over our country and our most vulnerable at this perilous moment in our nation\u2019s history. Members of Congress have a sworn duty to preserve our Constitution. Leaving a lawless president in office for political points would be abandoning that duty,\u201d Tlaib and Bonifaz argued. \u201cThis is not just about Donald Trump. This is about all of us. What should we be as a nation? Who should we be as a people? In the face of this constitutional crisis, we must rise.\u201dFollow Kyle on Twitter@RealKyleMorrisandFacebook.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOk, this is far worse than it appears.

Advised by individuals such as Tom Ridge, the first Secretary of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration;\u00a0Richard Stengel, the former editor of Time magazine and Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy for the Obama administration; and\u00a0Don Baer, the chairman of Burson, Cohn & Wolfe and former White House Communications Director for the Clinton administration; Newsguard aims to apply rankings of \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d to individual news websites in an attempt to fight \u201cfake news.\u201dIn practice, NewsGuard creates a news blacklist primarily aimed at sites not favored by the establishment, including Breitbart News, theDaily Mail, and the Drudge Report.However, many of the sites that NewsGuard has ranked as \u201ctrustworthy\u201d have spent their past few days smearing the names of the students of Covington Catholic High School. Websites such as the National Review Online, CNN, theNew York Times, theWashington Postand many others\u00a0condemned the students for their actions, but shortly after the video went viral, a new version of events was revealed. Breitbart News reporter Kristina Wrong wrote in an article:Video first began circulating Saturday showing a student wearing a Make America Great Again hat staring into the face of 64-year-old Nathan Phillips, a Native American man beating a drum.The short clip made it appear that the student, Nicholas Sandmann, was staring down Phillips, trying to intimidate him. An interview with Phillips after the confrontation showed him wiping away tears, talking about how he was intimidated by the students.Voices on the left \u2014 and some on the right \u2014 rushed in to condemn the boys, some even calling for them to be physically hurt.However, by Sunday, a fuller video of the incident emerged, showing \u201cBlack Israelite\u201d protesters taunting the students with insults and gay slurs, and then Phillips approaching the boys where they were waiting for their bus to leave.The video showed that Phillips approached the group of boys, drumming, as the Black Israelites egged on a confrontation. Phillips approaches Sandmann, who does not move away, but stands still, looking at Phillips.However, multiple mainstream outlets condemned the students of Covington Catholic High School before the full story was understood.The National Review Onlinepublished an articletitled\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe Covington Students Might as Well Have Just Spit on the Cross,\u201d in which\u00a0Deputy Managing\u00a0Editor Nicholas Frankovich described the actions of the Covington students writing: \u201cThey mock a serious, frail-looking older man and gloat in their momentary role as Roman soldiers to his Christ. \u2018Bullying\u2019 is a worn-out word and doesn\u2019t convey the full extent of evil on display here.\u201d He continued: \u201cDecide for yourself who is more pleasing to Christ, Phillips or his mockers. As for the putatively Catholic students from Covington, they might as well have just spit on the cross and got it over with.\u201dSince then, the NRO has retracted the article. NewsGuard also rates the NRO as extremely trustworthy:TheNew York Timesalleged that the students had been mockinga \u201cVietnam veteran\u201d when refusing to back down from Phillips. It was later discovered that Phillips had only served in the military during the Vietnam era and was never deployed to Vietnam during the war. TheTimesamended their article simply stating: \u201cinterviews and additional video footage have offered a fuller picture of what happened in this encounter.\u201d Since the publishing of that article,\u00a0L.A. trial attorney Robert Barnesoffered to representthe students of Covington to sue Maggie Haberman, the reporter that wrote the article.Despite the blatant misrepresentation of these events, NewsGuard has awarded theNew York Timeswith a trustworthy score, giving them a green light on each\u00a0criteria,\u00a0including \u201cgathers and presents information responsibly.\u201dTheWashington Postpublished a headline which read\u00a0\u201c\u2018It was getting ugly\u2019: Native American drummer speaks on the MAGA-hat-wearing teens who surrounded him.\u201d As more details became clear, thePostedited their title to read: \u201c\u2018It was getting ugly\u2019: Native American drummer speaks on his encounter with MAGA-hat-wearing teens.\u201d The article describes Sandmann\u2019s \u201crelentless smirk,\u201d and prints Phillips initial claims that the Covington students \u201cswarmed around him\u201d as he and other activists attempted to leave the area. Despite not issuing a full correction on the article, thePostwas also awarded a trustworthy rating by NewsGuard:Similarly CNNspoke negativelyof the Covington Catholic students before the full story was clear. CNN co-host Dave Briggs stated on air: \u201cOne thing is clear, the MAGA hats clearly caused an overreaction\u00a0by everyone on both sides. Again, I would like to hear from all of you. There was clearly some misunderstanding on both sides. That young man there does not look like someone who he is appreciative and considerate of this culture and of this chant going on,\u201d Briggs continued.\u00a0 \u201c[There\u2019s] clearly two sides of the story. The problem is we all overreact so instantly with these stories, and now the MAGA hats stand for a certain thing to a lot of people. Hopefully, some understanding and some positive\u00a0learning comes out of this.\u201d Unsurprisingly, CNN also receives an extremely trustworthy rating:New York Daily Newscolumnist Brandon Friedman also called for the identity of Nick Sandmann, who was unknown at the time, to be made public:TheNew York Daily Newsdoes not receive quite as stellar a recommendation as some of the other websites that NewsGuard verifies, but still receives quite a trustworthy rating:Leftist publication the\u00a0Huffington Post has yet to retract or change itsopen letter articletitled: \u201cTo The Teachers And Parents Of Covington Catholic High School,\u201d which alleges that the Covington students acted in a racist manner towards the Native Americans at the scene and condemns the children\u2019s parents and teachers for the situations. The article\u2019s author states, \u201cFor many in this country, MAGA hats amount to an explicit message of racial intolerance and bigotry,\u201d and claims that the Covington chaperones should have forbid the students from wearing them as they had \u201cthe potential to inflame and frighten others.\u201dThe article essentially claims that the students were asking for a fight due to the hats they were wearing. The article also derides the students for believing in rights such as free speech, stating: \u201cCombine that with the common belief of teen boys in their absolute right of freedom of speech and expression, their ignorance of how they appear to others, and the emboldening effect of a large group, and the whole thing was entirely foreseeable.\u201dHuffington Postalso receives a positive trustworthiness rating from NewsGuard:So while NewsGuard claims to rank news websites based on trustworthiness and their publication of \u201cfake news,\u201d it appears that this rule does not apply to websites that publish articles falsely accusing young high school students of racism.

Anyone who understands anything about fairness is appalled by this ongoing grift where large corporations and institutions (likeHollywood) get special treatment from the government. Time and again, we see, most especially at the state and local level, where unique tax (and other) incentives are used to attract businesses and the jobs and tax revenue that come with.It is an outrageous practice, but the alternative is worse.Crony capitalism is like free speech: There is plenty of downside in allowing unfettered free speech, but the cure \u2014 restricting speech \u2014 is always worse. Sure, the federal government could try to outlaw state and local politicians from offering these special incentives, but who wants that?So we just have to learn to live with crony capitalism while we try to put an end to it through argumentation and the electing of politicians who understand that a reasonable tax and regulatory environment is the best way to attract business and negate the need to offer incentives/bribes.Unfortunately, though, the world is what it is, and we cannot go around throwing away the good in pursuit of the perfect, which is exactly what Ocasio-Cortez did when she and a handful of other left-wing New York loons led the charge to scuttle this Amazon deal.To attract Amazon\u2019s second headquarters (HQ2), in a rare moment of cooperation, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both far-left Democrats, offered Amazon $3 billion in tax incentives.In return, Amazon agreed to create at least 25,000 good-paying jobs and to build a massive employee campus in Long Island City, Queens. Over the next 20 years, that $3 billion tax incentive would result in more than $25 billion in tax revenue.Overall, over time, HQ2 would pour as much as a trillion dollars into New York\u2019s economy \u2014 and not only through the salaries paid to the tech-savvy. This money would have trickled down to local stores and restaurants, not to mention the laborers required to build, clean, and maintain all that infrastructure.Sure, there\u2019s a downside. In many ways, gentrification does suck. Rents go up. Local businesses go down. Those who don\u2019t fit into the changing culture find themselves pushed out of it. But, hey, that\u2019s life, and eventually, most of us have to come to terms with the fact the future no longer belongs to us.But that HQ2 was a net-plus for New York, and, most especially, Long Island City is beyond dispute. Which means you have to ask yourself what the hell Ocasio-Cortez and her socialist confederates were thinking.Writing forthe Federalist, David Marcus believes she wasn\u2019t thinking at all:The jobs were already coming, so why not take the opportunity to stick your finger in the eye of the big, mean, nasty corporation? Today, all that changed. She fished what she wished and Amazon decided not to bring tens of thousands of jobs to New York City after all. Today, her effective opposition to the deal is a much different story, one in which she has to defend creating less opportunity for working New Yorkers.In other words, under the impression the deal was sealed, Ocasio-Cortez assumed she could have her cake and eat it too, could score socialist points railing against HQ2 without killing those 25,000 jobs. But with the help of some other local, socialist demagogues, she did kill it,andshe killed something her own constituents wanted.Two polls show broad public support for the deal, including among the very people Ocasio-Cortez was elected to serve: \u201cNew York City voters approve 57 \u2013 26 percent, including 60 \u2013 26 percent among Queens voters,\u201d Quinnipiacfound.A Siena College poll found that \u201cBy 56 to 36 percent New Yorkers approve of the recently announced deal between Amazon and New York which grants up to $3 billion in state and city incentives to Amazon[.]\u201dThose most eager to see the Amazon deal come to fruition were blacks and Hispanics, who backed the deal bywide margins. Seventy percent of black voters support it, while a mere 25 percent did not. Hispanics support the deal by an even wider margin of 81 to 17 percent.Many mistakes were made here. It was idiotic for Cuomo and de Blasio to work out the Amazon deal in secret, to not include lawmakers. They were begging for a wounded-ego rebellion. And Amazon could have been far less greedy in its Welfare Queen demands.Nevertheless, the world is what it is, and oftentimes it\u2019s messy and unfair, and maybe there\u2019s some Karma at work here. After all, the same New Yorkers losing these jobs are the same New Yorkers who continue to vote for far-left politicians who create a hostile business environment that requires crony capitalism to attract jobs.But there is a bigger lesson here \u2014 our first look at the real world effects of socialism and the manic puritans who practice it.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC.Follow his Facebook Pagehere.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4339573704\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe lefty foreign media, no doubt.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

When the Constitution was drafted, a lot of it had to do with slavery. The stave states wanted equal representation in the Senate because they wanted to keep slavery. The slave states wanted to have an electoral college where the members that they had in Congress counted towards the vote for president, where the slaves counted as\u00a0two-thirds and in the popular vote they would count as zero. So the slave states didn\u2019t want a popular election because their slaves wouldn\u2019t count toward voting and the slave states would have less votes.

Ilhan Omar Calls Notre Dame Cathedral \u2018Art and Architecture\u2019\n\n# News comment article:\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) called the Notre Dame Cathedral \u201cart and architecture\u201d in a tweet Monday, without referencing its name or significance to the Catholic religion.\u201cArt and architecture have a unique ability to help us connect across our differences and bring people together in important ways. Thinking of the people of Paris and praying for every first responder trying to save this wonder,\u201d she tweeted.The tweet sparked immediate criticism from those who noted that the historical Catholic cathedral was more than just \u201cart and architecture.\u201dOthers noted that she did not call the Notre Dame Cathedral by its name.Others filled in the history and significance of Notre Dame.One Twitter user suggested that when she inevitably receives criticism for the tweet, she should \u201ctake it on the chin and not play victim\u201d:The tweet follows controversy over Omar\u2019s recent remarks when she described the 9/11 attacks as \u201csome people did something.\u201d Her supporters claimed that critics of her remarks were trying to harm her safety.On Monday, a fire engulfed the ancient cathedral, destroying its timber roof, and bringing down the central spire. People all around the world watched in horror and prayed that the cathedral would be saved, and residents in Paris sang hymns and held a vigil.The Vatican sent out a message of mourning on Monday, saying, \u201cWith shock and sadness, the Holy See received the news of the terrible fire that devastated the Cathedral of Notre Dame, symbol of Christianity in France and the world.\u201d\u201cWe extend our closeness to French Catholics and to the people of Paris and ensure our prayers for the firefighters and those who are doing all they can to deal with this tragic situation,\u201d the Vaticansaid.The cathedral is in the process of restoration and recently had sixteen bronze statues removed from the roof area to facilitate work. The fire appears to have started near the roof where work was taking place.Although no suspicion of foul play has been reported, France has recently suffered an intense period of attacks on its Christian monuments, according to arecent reportby the Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4425613385\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAt that time, everyone's concern was putting out the fire.

This year, the holy period is expected to last through sundown on June 4.Breitbart News\u2019countthis week covers the 14 days of May 6 through May 19.The tally includes a total of 768 casualties (364 deaths, 404 injuries) in 14 countries: Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Kenya, Somalia, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria.Afghan Taliban narco-jihadis surpassed their Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) rivals as the world\u2019s chief perpetrators of terrorist attacks during Ramadan this year, with 29 attacks that killed 146 and wounded 156.ISIS closely trailed the Afghan Taliban with 23 assaults that resulted in 105 fatalities and 132 injuries.The Taliban is responsible for 40 percent of all fatalities while ISIS was behind an estimated 30 percent.Overall, the Taliban carried out nearly 40 percent (302) of all casualties, including injuries.Breitbart News found that, so far,Afghanistan(160 deaths, 189 injuries),Nigeria(50 deaths, 33 injuries) andIraq(46 deaths, 54 injuries) are the bloodiest countries during the holy month.Jihadis and other Islamistsencouragetheir followers and supporters to escalate attacks during the holy month, arguing that Allah exceptionally rewards martyrdom during Ramadan.The Afghan Talibanrejecteda Ramadan ceasefire offer by the Afghan government this month. Instead, Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the narco-jihadi group,proclaimed, \u201cAs jihad is \u2026 the best part of worship, doing it on Ramadan is rewarded more than in other months.\u201dThe vast majority of Ramadan attack victims are Muslims in Africa and the Middle East.Breitbart News primarily gleans its data for its Ramadan death tally from the Religion of Peacewebsite, but it also relies upon otherdatabasesas well as media and government reports.News outlets and officials may update some of the casualty figures as some of the wounded victims succumb to their injuries, potentially altering the count after Breitbart News publishes this report.Most Muslims follow the peaceful Ramadan tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset. Nevertheless, the number of attacks at the hands of jihadis tends to escalate during the month when compared to other times of the year.Breitbart News removed the May 11 attack in Pakistan by theethnic separatistgroup Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) as experts disagree on whether the group is primarily jihadist or secular separatist in nature.Breitbart News has documented the following attacks during Ramadan:May 6 \u2014North Waziristan, Pakistan\u2014 Suspected\u00a0Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) jihadiskillfour security forces, injure ten others.May 6 \u2014Kirkuk, Iraq\u2014

Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down, the official said.\u2026It was not clear whether Mr. Trump simply changed his mind on the strikes or whether the administration altered course because of logistics or strategy. It was also not clear whether the attacks might still go forward.TheTimesadded a curious detail: \u201cNo government officials asked The New York Times to withhold the article.\u201dTrump\u2019s criticsaccusedhim of \u201ccold feet.\u201d But the fact that the administration did not try to stop the story also suggests it could have been leaked deliberately. Indeed, at least one other reporter claimed he had received similar information:TrumptweetedThursday morning that \u201cIran made a very big mistake!\u201d, but later suggested that the \u201cmistake\u201d may have simply been an accident. In the double meaning of the word \u201cmistake,\u201d he preserved both the threat of retaliation and the possibility of a diplomatic solution.Regardless, Iran will know how close it was to being attacked, and still is.Joel B.

The Military Timesreportsthat Secret Service agents\u2019 current sidearm is a Sig Sauer 229 variant chambered in .357 Sig. The 229 uses magazines that hold \u201cmultiple bullets.\u201dSig Sauer\u2019s websitecontains information for a 229 Nitro Compact, which ships with two ten-round magazines. Such magazines would fall apparently be banned if there were a prohibition against magazines holding \u201cmultiple bullets.\u201dMoreover, the Secret Service is working to trade the .357 Sig round for a 9mm. This entails switching from the Sig Sauer to a Glock 19 for \u201cstandard issue,\u201d meaning 15-round magazines, at the least. Again, 15-round magazines are those that hold \u201cmultiple bullets\u201d and would therefore be prohibited under the parameters Biden presented.It is important to note that an individual Secret Service agent can carry more than one gun at once, depending on the assignment and whether the agent needs both hands free to carry out their duties. Agents carrying more than one gun could have their sidearm, with a magazine holding \u201cmultiple bullets,\u201d and a sub-machine gun, also using magazines that hold \u201cmultiple bullets.\u201dJoe Biden is alsocampaigningfor a requirement that all guns lock and unlock like smart phones.AWR\u00a0Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News\u00a0and the writer/curator ofDown Range with AWR Hawkins,\u00a0a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Err on the side of caution, I\u2019d rather people overreport to the police and the experts than under-report,\u201d he said.The Labour politician also praised the heroism of the have-a-go heroes who tackled Usman Khan armed with nothing but their bare hands, a fire extinguisher, anda narwhal tusk, as well as the emergency services, saying that \u201cWhat was amazing about today, was we saw in one individual, the suspect, the worst of humanity, but we also saw in the response from members of the public but also our emergency services the very vest of humanity.\u201d\u201c[T]he message I want to send\u2026 is we are resolute, we stand united in the face of terrorism, and we will not allow anybody to divide us,\u201d he insisted.Follow Jack Montgomery on Twitter:@JackBMontgomeryFollow Breitbart London on Facebook:Breitbart London\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n4709781682\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat motto may be the most stupid of all the lefty chants.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Andrew Cuomo\u2019s (D) latestjailbreak lawforced witness names to be revealed to the defense in the criminal case.Wilmer Maldonado Rodriguez, 36-years-old, who was set totestifyagainst MS-13 Gang members who had allegedly beaten and stabbed him in October 2018, was found bludgeoned to death after Cuomo\u2019s law forced his identity to be released to the defense in the ongoing pre-trial stage, according toNewsday.\u201cThis courageous man was prepared to testify against his alleged assailants at an upcoming trial, but he was brutally beaten to death before he could,\u201d Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement to the media.\u201cThis case underscores the importance of safeguarding the identities of witnesses and victims of crime and our hearts are with Mr. Maldonado\u2019s family and friends as we grieve his loss,\u201d Singas said.Originally, Rodriguez\u2019s identity was protected as a witness against the MS-13 Gang members in the alleged 2018 attack. As Breitbart Newswarnedin December 2019, though, Rodriguez\u2019s identity was released to the defense after elected New York Democrats and Cuomo passed a jailbreak law that mandates witnesses for the prosecution be turned over to the defense in criminal trials no later than 15 days after the defendants\u2019 arraignment.The judge in the trial told the defense not to reveal Rodriguez\u2019s identity to their clients until the trial started. In interviews withNewsday, defense attorneys representing the two accused MS-13 Gang members said they did not disclose Rodriguez\u2019s name to their clients:\u201cI never gave him the name of those people. And he never asked me for it,\u201dGreg Madey said Wednesday, the defense attorney for one of the defendants, Denis Pineda, 20.\u201cI\u2019m offended by the allegation that Denis Pineda had something to do with orchestrating this murder,\u201dhe added of Rodriguez\u2019s slaying. [Emphasis added]Justin Feinman, the defense attorney for Elian Ramos Velasquez, 19, said that the suggestion\u201cat this point to say that it was a defense attorney that leaked without more information is completely inappropriate.\u201d[Emphasis added]The New York law, which went into effect this January,\u00a0ensures that suspects accused of crimes deemed \u201cnon-violent\u201d are not jailed before their trial dates and do not have to post bail. Instead, these suspects are released directly back into the public and expected to show up for their court dates.Those so-called non-violent crimes include second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, possessing an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, and aggravated vehicular homicide.Likewise, if suspects show up to their court dates after their release, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has started a program togiftthem with prizes like Mets tickets, movie passes, and gift cards.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

They had to get out.\u201dThe border between the U.S. and Canada \u2014 the longest in the world \u2014 closed last week in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, as both countries see the numbers of those infected rise.Harry and Meghan rocked the Royal family with their January announcement that they will no longer represent the monarchy as they pursue a new, financially independent life.TheSunsaid the move to California \u201chad been planned for some time\u201d and that the couple had \u201crealised Canada would not work out for various reasons\u201d.\u201cThey want to be based in the Los Angeles area,\u201d the source told the tabloid.\u00a0 \u201cBut this move was planned for some time. They realised Canada would not work out for various reasons and they want to be based in the Los Angeles area.\u201cThey have a big support network there. It\u2019s where their new team of Hollywood agents and PRs and business managers are based.\u201dMeghan grew up in the Californian city and her mother, Doria Ragland, still lives there as does her father.The one-time actress also has a network of friends and work contacts in Los Angeles, where she could now seek to restart her career.Disney announced on Thursday she will narrate a new film about a family of African elephants, set for release next Friday.Kensington Palace, the couple\u2019s official residence, did not respond to a request for comment about the reported U.S. move.The new life in the U.S. comes in direct contradiction to what theDaily Mailreported in January. It said then the couple planned on living in Canada and would eventually seek a home and business in Los Angeles \u2013 but only after U.S. President Donald Trump left office.\u201cIt\u2019s by no means an immediate thing but there is a long-term plan to end up back in the U.S. with a second home in Canada, where they will also spend a great deal of time,\u201d a source told the newspaper.But Markle, 38, has said she won\u2019t move back while Trump is president, according to theMail, citing her friends.AFP contributed to this storyFollow Simon Kent on Twitter:Follow @SunSimonKentor e-mail to: skent@breitbart.com\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThey'll feel right at home in a major hot spot of the nation's lefties.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Consumer spending, which supplied 80 percent of last year\u2019s growth, and factory activity were weaker than expected.China, where the pandemic began in December, is the first major economy to start to recover after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control. Factories were allowed to reopen last month, but cinemas and other businesses that employ millions of people still are closed.Consumption and services, the more market-driven parts of the economy, are in a protracted slump as businesses in China struggle to find customers and demand has slumped due to heavy job losses and fears of a second viral outbreak. Those same factors could also so recoveries in the U.S. and Europe.\u201cChina is in for a drawn-out recovery,\u201d he said.The last contraction this big was 5.8 percent in 1967 during the upheavals of the ultra-radical 1965-75 Cultural Revolution, according to Iris Pang of ING.Forecasters earlier said China might rebound as early as this month. But a sharp recovery is unlikely, in part because demand from importers has slumped due to the economic drag of the pandemic and in part because domestic demand has remained extremely weak.Instead, they expect a gradual crawl back to growth in low single digits in the coming quarters. For the full year, forecasters including UBS, Nomura and Oxford Economics expect little to no growth.In total, China has reported 4,632 deaths after the total for Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was revised upward Friday. The mainland has announced 82,367 cases.Retail sales fell 19 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter. That improved in March, the final month of the quarter, to a decline of 15.8%. But consumers, jittery about possible job losses, are reluctant to spend despite government efforts to lure them back to shopping malls and auto showrooms.That is a blow to automakers and other companies that hope China will power the world economy out of its most painful slump since the 1930s.Job-hunter Ni Hong\u2019s challenge highlights the problem. Ni, 32, quit her job in Beijing in January to find a new one, but the virus disrupted those plans. Ni is paying her mortgage out of her savings and avoiding other spending while she looks in a market flooded with newly laid-off workers.\u201cIn the past, there were maybe two or three candidates for a post,\u201d Ni said. \u201cNow, I have eight to 10 competitors, so the chance for me to be eliminated is much higher.\u201dThat is a political challenge for the ruling party, which bases its claim to power on China\u2019s economic success. The party appealed to companies to keep paying employees and avoid layoffs during the shutdown. But an unknown number have failed, adding to public anxiety.The economy already was squeezed by a tariff war with President Donald Trump over Beijing\u2019s technology ambitions and trade surplus. Last year\u2019s growth sank to a multi-decade low of 6.1 percent.Exports fell 6.6 percent in March from a year earlier, an improvement over the double-digit plunge in January and February. But forecasters say demand is bound to slump in America and Europe as anti-virus controls keep shoppers at home.\u201cLingering consumption weakness and sliding foreign demand will weigh on the upturn,\u201d said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.Growth was stronger than some forecasts that called for a contraction of up to 16 percent but this is the biggest contraction since market-style reforms started in 1979.\u201cThe numbers were even uglier than most anticipated, which is good!\u201d said Andy Rothman of Matthews Asia in a report. \u201cThese ugly numbers indicate that the leadership didn\u2019t fudge the data to hide the seriousness of the situation.\u201dInvestment in factories, real estate, and other fixed assets, the other major growth driver, sank 16.1 percent.Auto sales sank 48.4 percent from a year earlier in March. That was better than February\u2019s record 81.7 percent plunge but is on top of a 2-year-old decline that is squeezing global and Chinese automakers in the industry\u2019s biggest global market.Asian stock markets rose following the announcement, which was in line with investor expectations. By mid-afternoon, Tokyo\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 3 percent and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was 2.4 percent higher.The ruling party has yet to announce this year\u2019s official growth target. It has been at least 6 percent in previous years. Beijing looks likely to miss its target of doubling incomes from 2010 levels by this year.Controls on Beijing, the capital, and some other cities have been tightened to prevent a resurgence of the disease. Most foreigners are barred from entering the country.Beijing is boosting spending on a \u201cNew Infrastructure\u201d Plan that includes next-generation telecom networks, artificial intelligence, electric vehicle charging and data centers. But leaders don\u2019t want to pump too much money into the economy with full fledged stimulus for fear of adding to debt or pushing up inflation that is near a seven-year high.Carrying out that infrastructure investment \u201cwill take a much longer time than it would do without social distancing in place,\u201d said Pang of ING. \u201cRecovery will be a long road.\u201d___\u2014The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Apologists often describe the names as a necessary gesture of reconciliation in the wake of the Civil War. In truth, the namings reflect a federal embrace of white supremacy that found its most poisonous expression in military installations where black servicemen were deliberately placed under the command of white Southerners \u2014 who were said to better \u201cunderstand\u201d Negroes \u2014 and confined to substandard housing, segregated transportation systems and even \u201ccolored only\u201d seating in movie houses.The editorial further claims that \u201cThe federal government embraced pillars of the white supremacist movement when it named military bases in the South.\u201dIt rejects the argument \u2014 offered by the U.S. Army during the Obama administration that \u201cthere was no need to expunge Confederate base names because the names were merely \u2018historic\u2019 and \u2018represent individuals, not causes or ideologies.'\u201dTuskegee airman Charles McGee, 100, and his great grandson Iain Lanphier react as President Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)The editorial also claims that the names were adopted \u201cas part of broader accommodation in which the military embraced stringent segregation so as not to offend Southerners.\u201dThe South has historically contributed disproportionately to the ranks of the U.S. military, and continues to do so today: in fiscal year 2017, itcontained33 percent of the nation\u2019s young adult population, but provided 41 percent of the nation\u2019s military enlistees.TheTimesprovides no other example of the U.S. military \u201ccelebrating white supremacy.\u201dJoel B.

Trump says it\u2019s probably better to just \u201cwatch that disaster\u201d in liberal areas like Seattle instead of \u201cstraightening it out fast.\u201d Trump says it\u2019s better to \u201clet it simmer\u201d for a little bit to see what the \u201cleft-wing radicals\u201d will do to the country.

According to the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), several protestersequippedwith bats, shields, and gas masks \u201ckicked and pounded on plywood attached to the west exterior glass doors of the Federal Courthouse\u201d around 11 p.m. using various tools. They ultimately breached the west side doors of the building, prompting a response from federal law enforcement:A crowd regathered after midnight at the Federal Courthouse and \u201cset a fire outside the west side doors located on the portico,\u201d forcing federal law enforcement to respond again. According to the PPB, demonstrators began to stack barricades and sections of fence outside the building, \u201cwhich created a hazard to those who needed to exit the building\u201d:Per the PPB:Around 1:00 a.m., some people associated with the group opened a fire hydrant at Southwest 3rd Avenue and Southwest Taylor Street and added soap to the water causing a hazard downtown. Some other people downtown set several small fires while other people vandalized and spray painted both city, federal, and private property. At 1:27 a.m., another fire was lit outside an exit door on the south side of the Federal Courthouse and the group successfully tore off a large piece of plywood protecting some glass doors on the west side of the building. At 1:45 a.m., Federal Police Officers once again were forced to disperse the crowd west from the building. During the dispersal, a large fire was started in the middle of Lownsdale Square.Portland Police did not respond to any of the incidents and made no arrests.Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, has defended the presence of federal law enforcement in the city.\u201cIf you did your job from a local perspective, we wouldn\u2019t be there,\u201d hesaidTuesday. \u201cWhat we have in Portland is very different than what we have in any other city.\u201dDespite that, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) has remained obstinate. He continues to contend that civil unrest in Portland was subsiding prior to the arrival of federal law enforcement.\u201cThe violence was being contained and started to de-escalate before they arrived. They intervened and escalated tensions to new levels,\u201d hesaidin a statement.\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask for these troops in our cities.

According to a statement published online, the decision was motivated by the department\u2019s commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement.According to areportby Campus Reform, the University of Chicago announced recently that incoming Ph.D. candidates in the English Department will be required to focus their research on \u201cblack studies.\u201dThe university\u2019s decision was highlighted on Tuesday by Cornell Ph.D. candidate Phillipe Lemoine in a tweet that went viral. \u201cThis is wild, \u201d Lemoine wrote.\u201cFor the 2020-2021 graduate admissions cycle, the University of Chicago English Department is accepting only applicants interested in working in\u00a0and with\u00a0Black Studies,\u201d a statement on the university website reads. \u201cWe understand Black Studies to be a capacious intellectual project that spans a variety of methodological approaches, fields, geographical areas,\u00a0languages, and time periods.\u201dIn thestatement, the English department said that its commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement inspired their decision to restrict the area of study for incoming Ph.D. candidates.The English department at the University of Chicago believes that Black Lives Matter, and that the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and Rayshard Brooks matter, as do thousands of others named and unnamed who have been subject to police violence. As literary scholars, we attend to the histories, atmospheres, and scenes of anti-Black racism and racial violence in the United States and across the world. We are committed to the struggle of Black and Indigenous people, and all racialized and dispossessed people, against inequality and brutality.Breitbart Newsreportedin August that students at the University of Chicago had called on administrators to cut ties with the Chicago Police Department. In response, Chicago Police Department Supt. David Brown said that his officers would continue to reduce violence in the area surrounding the university\u2019s campus.Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5071511036\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBut I'm still waiting for my white privilege to do something for me.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

The authors claim that countries will not \u201cexaggerate\u201d the severity of the pandemic to receive more vaccines, because that would hurt economic activity.Emanuel is regarded as one of the key architects of Obamacare, andwrotea controversial article 2014,\u201dWhy I Hope to Die at 75.\u201dPfizerannouncedMonday that a vaccine it was developing with\u00a0German drugmaker BioNTech was 90% effective.The company claimed, incorrectly, that it had not participated in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d (itboastedof its involvement in July). It has a $2 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million doses \u2014 with an option to deliver 500 million more. Americans will receive the vaccine for free, thanks to the administration\u2019s policy.Emanuel is also the brother of President Barack Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel.Joel B.

I will say we have had a great deal of cooperation from the men and women who have been serving the civil service at agencies across the government. That has been encouraging. They are the heart and soul of the government and how the government continues year after year after year under Democratic and Republican presidents. They have been limited cases of abrupt behavior including at times and the president himself, the president of the United States himself.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe are not going to worry about that. Our focus is on getting the president-elect inaugurated, pursuing his agenda moving forward, getting the pandemic under control, taking on the herculean task of distributing the vaccine, which is going to be a big part of our focus in the first couple of months.

Wade, the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, Pokorsky observes, and he has promised he will be \u201cappointing judges that respect foundational precedents like Roe.\u201dHe already rescinded the pro-life Mexico City Policy, which ensured that taxpayer dollars would not go to organizations that perform or refer for abortions abroad, he adds.Biden has also called on Congress to quickly pass the Equality Act, which would add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Biden nominated Xavier Becerra\u00a0to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Becerra \u201csupports legislation that permits partial-birth abortion, forces every healthcare plan to pay for abortions, forces pro-life pregnancy centers to advertise abortions, forces the Little Sisters of the Poor to pay for contraception and abortion drugs, and allows assisted suicide,\u201d the priest declares.Biden\u2019s insistent claim that he is a devout Catholic forces an \u201cunavoidable choice,\u201d the priest states.

We believe we achieved that objective some years ago. We judge the threat against the homeland now emanating from Afghanistan to be at a level that we can address it without a persistent military footprint in the country and without remaining at war with the Taliban.The President made the determination and is announcing tomorrow that the best path forward to advance American interests is to end the war in Afghanistan after 20 years so that we can address the global threat picture as it exists today, not as it was two decades ago.We\u2019ve long known that military force would not solve Afghanistan\u2019s internal political challenges, would not end Afghanistan\u2019s internal conflict. And so we are ending our military operations while we focus our efforts on supporting, diplomatically, the ongoing peace process.The decision is a somewhat surprising continuation of former President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to bring all U.S. forces home from Afghanistan. His administration negotiated a peace plan with the Taliban that would bring troops home by May 1.However, the Biden administration had in recent weeks signaled that it would not meet the May 1 deadline, but that a drawdown would happen before next year.The senior administration official said the U.S. would remain \u201cdeeply engaged\u201d with the government of Afghanistan and committed to the Afghan people, and would use \u201cour full toolkit to ensure the future that the Afghan people are seeking has the best chance of coming about.\u201dIn addition, allied troops from NATO countries and partners that were part of the U.S.-led war effort are also withdrawing, the official said.The official said the administration would not take its eye off the terrorist threat or signs of al Qaeda\u2019s resurgence, and noted terrorist threats emanate from a number of countries, including from Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other parts of Africa \u2014 not just Afghanistan.In another continuation of the Trump foreign policy, the official said the U.S. needed to focus on competition with China.The official said the only U.S. military presence in the country will be enough to support the U.S.\u2019s diplomatic presence. That exact number is still being worked out, the official said.Follow Breitbart News\u2019s Kristina Wong onTwitteror onFacebook.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5342191774\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nNot to worry \u2013 our new woke military can suit up our pregnant women pilots in special maternity flight suits.

The attack was so violent that it shattered the mop handle into pieces upon making an impact with the victim\u2019s body.Nawaz was charged with assault and using an offensive weapon and Malik was charged with assault and racially aggravated assault.The pair both pled guilty to their offences on Thursday, May 27th at the Wolverhampton Crown Court.Yet the two thugs both avoided any time behind bars, merely receiving short suspended sentences. Malik was handed a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years and Nawaz was given a six-month sentence, suspended for one year.Malik and Nawaz were both ordered to pay the council worker\u00a0\u00a3500 in compensation for their attack. Police said that the victim of the attack suffered bruising from the assault but was thankfully not seriously injured.Dudley Police Inspector Pete Sandhusaid: \u201cThis was a really shocking incident, a violent attack and racist abuse against a council contractor who was simply doing his job.\u201cThe women who\u2019d been seen littering remained calm, engaged with the officer and urged the two men not to get involved.\u201cBut they ignored their pleas, threatened the victim and Nawaz shattered a wooden pole over him as he tried to retreat.\u201cThere is absolutely no excuse for this kind of behaviour and the two men should be ashamed of their actions.\u201dHe did not indicate that he was dissatisfied with the court\u2019s failure to actual imprison the violent criminalsDudley Councillor Karen Shakespeare, cabinet member for public realm, went so far as to say that \u201cWe welcome the verdict,\u201d despite describing the attack as \u201ca despicable act against an enforcement officer who was carrying out his duties in order to help keep our borough clean and tidy.\u201d\u201cIt is disappointing that a small number of people seek to spoil our environment by littering, but residents can be assured that we will continue to take strong enforcement action against litter louts,\u201d the politician added, opting to emphasise the environmental element of the crime rather than the racism.Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here@KurtZindulka\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5402075919\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nYou too.

I\u2019ve said it before. We\u2019re facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. It\u2019s not hyperbole \u2014 since the Civil War. Confederates, back then, never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January 6.I\u2019m not saying this to alarm you. I\u2019m saying this because you should be alarmed.While it is true Confederate soldiers never breached the U.S. Capitol, the Civil War was the nation\u2019s bloodiest war, with anestimated750,000 deaths.The only person whodiedas a direct result of violence in the January 6 riot was Ashli Babbitt, a United States Air Force veteran. She was unarmed when she was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she climbed\u00a0through a broken door into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby.Three other people who died had medical emergencies, and Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknicksufferedtwo strokes at the base of his brainstem as a result of a blood clot in an artery the day after the riot, Breitbart Newsreported.Before his \u201cnot-hyperbole,\u201d Biden said that \u201cbullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country,\u201d in reference to the GOP.He continued:I never thought in my entire career I would have to say it. But I swore an oath to you and to God to preserve protect and defend the Constitution.That\u2019s an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic.Biden\u2019s remarks came after Texas Democrats fled their state on Monday in protest against election integrity measures. The lawmakers were seen \u201cgleefully smiling en route to D.C. with a case of beer, which requires a photo ID to purchase,\u201d Breitbart Newsreported.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThis could be one of the better examples of collective Democrat ignorance coupled with dishonesty.

Watching the shit go down in Afghanistan, I was reminded lately of every conversation I\u2019ve ever had with an immigrant, almost all of which \u2014 if we got to really talking \u2014 included the notion, oh, you people have no idea. All you do is bitch about and badmouth your own country, but if you knew about the country I came from, you\u2019d stop shitting on your own.\u201dHe added, \u201cI have never been a rah-rah America type, and in fact, have often made fun of Republicans in the past for being overly sentimental. \u2026 But liberals, as usual in this era, have now gone too far in the other direction. They under-romanticize America. They have no perspective. Last week, the Taliban murdered a comedian. His name was Nazar Mohammad, and he made up funny songs on TikTok. They forced him into a car, tortured, and then executed him, a comedian, a thing like that hits a little close to home for me. I\u2019ve had two presidents up my ass. \u2026 I mean, neither experience was pleasant, but I didn\u2019t have to worry about being dragged until I\u2019m dead behind a Toyota Tacoma. Have a little perspective about the stuff we howl about here. I\u2019m sorry your professor said something you didn\u2019t like, that won\u2019t be a problem with the Taliban.

There\u2019s a reason Afghan mothers are handing their babies to us. And we should take them. Americans, right now, should take in Afghan refugees into their homes and into their neighborhoods. And I\u2019m sure everyone who just clapped is thinking the same thing, yes, someone who isn\u2019t me should definitely do that. But that doesn\u2019t make us the bad guys. We\u2019re not the bad guys. Oppression is what we were trying to stop in Afghanistan. We failed, but any immigrant will tell you we\u2019ve largely succeeded here. And yet the overriding thrust of current woke ideology is that America is rotten to the core, irredeemably racist from the moment it was founded and so oppressive, sexist, and homophobic we can\u2019t find a host for the Oscars or \u2018Jeopardy!'\u201dHe continued, \u201cI\u2019m sure you heard, the new \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 guy is out because he said boobies in 2014. And this is where your new Afghani roommates that you took in will prove so valuable. Because they\u2019ll turn to you and say, have you people lost your f*cking minds? Have you ever heard of honor killings? Public beheadings? Throwing gay men off of roofs? Arranged marriages to minors? State-sanctioned wife-beating? Female genital mutilation? Marriage by capture? Because we have. What\u2019s the lesson of Afghanistan? Maybe it\u2019s that everyone from the giant dorm room bitch session that is the Internet should take a good look at what real oppression looks like. \u2026\u00a0America may not be the country of your faculty lounge and Twitter dreams, but no one here tries to escape by hanging onto an airplane.\u201dFollow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter@IanHanchett\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5512712728\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBut that's much better than the rest of the Hollywood crowd who defend the Dems no matter what.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Afghans and Syrians made up around a third of all the asylum claims in the country, which saw a 33 per cent increase in applications compared to 2020.Some have warned that an increase in Afghan arrivals could also lead to anincrease in crime, with\u00a0Pierre-Marie S\u00e8ve, the director and spokesman of the French think tank\u00a0the Institute for Justice, claiming Afghans were more prone to criminal behaviour.Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at@TomlinsonCJor email at\u00a0ctomlinson(at)breitbart.com\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5673918394\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIf the editor calls for a stock photo of a criminal holding a knife, they won't find a photo of the type of perpetrators who commit the vast majority of those crimes, because that would be racist.

Only 45 percent say they disagree.This includes50 percent of black voterswho want to see Biden impeached.\u201cHalf of voters believe President Joe Biden should be impeached, and nearly as many think Republicans will do it if they win a congressional majority in the midterm elections,\u201dsaysRasmussen Reports.\u201cA new national telephone and online survey by Rasmussen Reports and\u00a0The National Pulse\u00a0finds that 50% of Likely U.S. voters support the impeachment of Biden, including 33% who Strongly Support it.\u201dRasmussen adds, \u201cForty-five percent (45%) are opposed to impeaching Biden, including 33% who Strongly Oppose it.\u201dAre you ready for this\u2026? Thirty-four (34 percent) of Democrats support impeaching Biden, as do 50 percent (not a typo) of black voters.The internals here are fascinating\u2026. When these same respondents were asked if impeaching former President Trump twice was a \u201cgood thing\u201d or \u201cbad thing,\u201d only 36 percent said it was a \u201cgood thing,\u201d while 47 percent said it was a \u201cbad thing.\u201d What\u2019s more, only 56 percent of Democrats and 42 percent of black voters believe it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d to impeach Trump.When asked if the GOP will go through with impeachment if they recapture the House in the 2022 midterms, 45 percent believe it\u2019s likely, while 42 percent say otherwise.Basically, and without billions of corporate media dollars being spent to frame him \u2014 which is what happened to Trump \u2014 Biden\u2019s impeachment numbers are right up there with Trump\u2019s during the Ukraine Phone Call Hoax.But Biden\u2019s problems are all based on his actual performance as president. Biden\u2019s problems aredespitebillions of corporate media dollars being spent to protect and prop him up. Biden\u2019s problems are based on nothing artificial, only the state of the country and his own decisions as president, including his violations of the Constitution. Let\u2019s face it, Biden has not onlyopenly violatedthe Constitution, but he is also flagrantly ignoring the laws regarding border security and breaking the law by, among other things, allowing countless thousands of unvaccinated illegals to invade our country.The people see this, and the corporate media no longer have the power to cover it up or gaslight the public into believing it\u2019s okay.If the GOP does win the House in November and does proceed with impeachment, the public will be with them.And the GOPshould impeach. After all, in their war against Trump, it was Democrats who turned impeachment into just another partisan tool. Republicans should do the same, especially when Biden is indeed breaking the law.Follow John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC.Follow his Facebook Pagehere.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAnd we are to believe the Marquette poll that has Xiden beating both Trump and DeSantis?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

She said her ministry is receiving data from the battlefield \u201cthe next day,\u201d and sometimes a day later.Armed Forces Ukrainemadeasimilar claimof casualties and equipment destroyed on Twitter, presumably relying on the same data as the deputy defense minister.Kharkiv Mayor Oleh Sinegubovclaimedon Sunday night that Ukrainian forces repelled a major offensive and completely wiped out the invading force, capturing dozens of Russian troops and their equipment.\u201cControl of Kharkiv is completely ours\u201d after Ukrainian forces completed \u201ca full clearing of the city of the enemy,\u201d said Sinegubov.The Russian militarymadeitsfirst admissionof casualties on Sunday, although it did not offer any numbers of dead and wounded, or an inventory of equipment captured or destroyed by the Ukrainians.Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov acknowledged \u201cthere are dead and wounded among our comrades,\u201d but insisted Russia\u2019s losses are \u201cmany times\u201d smaller than casualties suffered by the Ukrainians.Konashenkovsalutedthe \u201ccourage and heroism\u201d of Russian forces and claimed the Ukrainians are torturing their prisoners, an offense he vowed to avenge.\u201cAll faces, voices, phones, their coordinates, IP addresses, as well as correspondence of all Ukrainian Nazis involved in the torture of our comrades have been recorded and identified. This also applies to the leaders of the Kyiv regime and their perpetrators, who directly call for bullying of Russian servicemen in violation of the convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. All of you will be found and will inevitably bear severe responsibility,\u201d he said.Konashenkov claimed Russian forces have destroyed 254 Ukrainian tanks and armored fighting vehicles, 31 combat aircraft, 46 rocket launchers, and 103 artillery pieces.\u201cJust today, 7 anti-aircraft missile systems were destroyed, including one S-300 near the city of Kramatorsk,\u201d he said.Outside observers have not been able to confirm either Ukrainian or Russian claims. At a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)briefingon Sunday, senior American military officialssaidthe Ukrainians are putting up \u201cstiff resistance,\u201d while Russia is facing \u201cfuel and logistics shortages,\u201d especially in their attack on the vital Ukrainian city of Kharkiv and their drive to reach the capital of Kyiv.\u201cWe still, as of this morning, have no indication that the Russian military has taken control of any cities,\u201d DoD said, contradicting Russian claims to the contrary.\u201cThe airspace over Ukraine is still contested. And that means that the Ukrainians are still using both aircraft, and their own air and missile defense systems, which we believe are still intact and still viable,\u201d DoD noted, lending some credibility to Ukrainian claims of destroying Russian planes and missile launchers.U.S. officials offered some interesting observations on Russia\u2019s heavy reliance on short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs),notingthat over 320 have been launched against targets in Ukraine \u2013 possibly theheaviestSRBM cross-border bombardment in history \u2013 but the effect on Ukrainian defenses seems considerably less than Russia anticipated. The Russians are therefore adopting \u201csiege tactics\u201d around Ukrainian cities, which could create a humanitarian crisis.\u201cWe have seen some indications that they have experienced failures in some of these launches, that not all missiles have launched effectively,\u201d DoD said.\u201cI would tell you that our best estimate is that they did not anticipate the level of resistance that they were going to encounter,\u201d a senior defense official said, while cautioning that Russia still has vast amounts of combat power it could move into Ukraine.Some independent military analystsbelieveUkraine is essentially correct about inflicting disproportionate and unexpected casualties on the Russian invasion force \u2013 and that could be bad news for Ukrainian citizens, because the Russian military might abandon the precautions it has thus far taken to minimize collateral damage.\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5773186614\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMaybe you meant Jen Psaki?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

Treaty Amendment Would Yield United States Public Health Powers to U.N.\n\n# News comment article:\nThe World Health Organization (W.H.O.) is pushing for a \u201cglobal pandemic treaty\u201d to be ratified at its World Health Assembly, which begins on May 22.The treaty would give the W.H.O. tremendous increases in power and funding, transferring much of the authority for pandemic control from member nations to the U.N. agency. The Biden administration in January proposed amendments to W.H.O.\u2019s International Health Regulations (IHR) that would eliminate all requirements for W.H.O. to consult with member governments before declaring a disease outbreak.Both the IHR amendments and the new \u201cglobal pandemic treaty\u201d are set to be topics of discussion at the upcoming World Health Assembly.Supporters say this is necessary to improve worldwide pandemic response, while critics warn about the loss of national sovereignty to a globalist organization that did not distinguish itself during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.Article 9 of the Biden administration\u2019sproposed IHR amendmentssimply strikes out the existing requirement for W.H.O. to \u201cconsult with and attempt to obtain verification from the State Party in whose territory the event is allegedly occurring.\u201d Every subsequent reference in the IHR to consulting with the relevant state party is likewise erased, effectively giving the W.H.O. director unilateral authority to declare outbreaks.US President Joe Biden meets with business leaders to discuss the Bipartisan Innovation Act, in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, near the White House, in Washington, DC, on March 9, 2022.TheWorld Council for Health(WCH), a non-profit organization opposed to the amended IHR that would increase W.H.O.\u2019s power, summarized the amendments and the Biden administration\u2019s support for them:On January 18th 2022, the United States Department of Health and Human Services proposed amendments to the IHR. These amendments give control over the declaration of a public health emergency in any member state to the WHO Director-General \u2013 even over the objection of the member state. The Director-General communicated the text of the proposed amendments on 20 January 2022, via a circular letter to State Parties.The proposed IHR amendments also cede control to WHO \u201cregional directors,\u201d who are given the authority to declare a Public Health Emergency of Regional Concern (PHERC). Moreover, the proposed amendments allow the Director-General to ring an international alarm bell, by unilaterally issuing an \u201cIntermediate Public Health Alert (IPHA).\u201dProperly understood, the proposed IHR amendments are directed towards establishing a globalist architecture of worldwide health surveillance, reporting, and management. Consistent with a top-down view of governance, the public will not have opportunities to provide input or criticism concerning the amendments. This, of course, is a direct violation of the basic tenets of democracy and can be compared to the separate new pandemic treaty.Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) speaks during the House Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing on the administration foreign policy priorities on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, March 10, 2021, in Washington. (Ken Cedeno/Pool via AP)The WCH critique was cited by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) in hisdenunciationof the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cabsurd proposal to surrender U.S. sovereignty to the corrupt World Health Organization\u201d on Wednesday:At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO caved to pressure from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and enabled China to hoodwink the world by providing tremendous cover to the CCP\u2019s deadly lie that the coronavirus was not transmissible from person to person, even after being informed of the truth by Taiwan.Instead of demanding accountability from the WHO and its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus for their complicity in the spread of COVID, as I argued two years ago, the Biden Administration seeks to turn over American sovereignty and decision-making, potentially subjecting us to the CCP\u2019s ongoing malign influence.The alarming amendments offered by the Biden Administration to the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations would grant new unilateral authority to Director-General Tedros to declare a public health crisis in the United States or other sovereign nations, without any consultation with the U.S. or any other WHO member.Smith was particularly opposed to the proposal that would eliminate the current requirement for W.H.O. to consult with the governments of member nations, including the United States, before declaring an infectious disease outbreak.The WCH also criticized the amendments for giving W.H.O. increased surveillance powers and placing greater decision-making emphasis on its models and simulations.W.H.O. would also be empowered to use \u201cundisclosed sources\u201d for its pandemic data, which could include all manner of self-interested or politicized sources, from pharmaceutical companies to organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The director-general of the W.H.O. would gain unilateral authority to declare health emergencies and take punitive action against member nations.American Businessman Bill Gates attends a discussion during the \u2018Munich Security Conference\u2019 in Munich, Germany, Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. (Michael Probst/AP)The top spot in the agency is not currently an especially competitive one; Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuswonre-election unopposed this year.Supporters of the IHR amendments dismiss concerns about national sovereignty and insist W.H.O. would gain no decision-making or enforcement powers, instead merely assuming an enhanced advisory capacity with tougher requirements for member states to report pandemic data accurately.\u201cIt is utterly untrue that the IHR would interfere with health care decisions or transfer such decisions to the WHO Director-General. The IHR amendments would ask countries to promptly and truthfully report infectious disease outbreaks, and WHO would offer assistance in managing the outbreak. But it could not force a country to allow WHO staff to interfere with its public health decision making,\u201d Georgetown University law professor Lawrence Gostin told theAssociated Presson Wednesday.The AP\u2019s correspondents also dismissed concerns that W.H.O.\u2019s expanded authority could be diverted to politicized causes like climate change or gun control, where activists frequently describe the issues as public health crises, or explicitly want them to be addressed with government powers developed to combat the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\u201cUnfortunately, there has been a small minority of groups making misleading statements and purposefully distorting facts. W.H.O. is an expression of Member States\u2019 own sovereignty and W.H.O. is entirely what the sovereign 194 Member States want W.H.O. to be,\u201d Tedros declared on Tuesday.The Biden administration made its reform proposals in January after balking at some of W.H.O.\u2019s more grandiose demands for more money and power. The administration was reportedly concerned that W.H.O.\u2019s demands for increased mandatory fees were too high and quietly worried about W.H.O.\u2019s ability to confront China.As with Rep. Smith, critics of the IHR amendments point to China\u2019s history ofgiving false informationto W.H.O. andconcealing vital pandemic datato question whether any of these enhanced W.H.O. powers would have any effect on the nation that unleashed the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, and is highly likely to be the source of future pandemics.Security personnel stand guard outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus make a visit to the institute in Wuhan in China\u2019s central Hubei province on February 3, 2021. (HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images)The Chinese apparently have little interest in waging a charm offensive to allay these concerns. On Thursday, Beijing angrilyrejectedcalls for W.H.O. to restore Taiwan\u2019s observer status \u2013 a purely political move by the malevolent regime in Beijing that has demonstrably injured the health of people in Taiwan and around the world.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was among those who said W.H.O.\u2019s blacklist of Taiwan was \u201cunwarranted.\u201d\u201cWe firmly oppose the relevant statement issued by the U.S. There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry angrily responded.The response was delivered by spokesman Zhao Lijian, who was instrumental in pushing China\u2019sderanged allegationsthat Chinese coronavirus was created in a U.S. Army laboratory in Ft. Detrick, Maryland. Chinaattemptedto drag W.H.O. into peddling this conspiracy theory.Chinese state media on Thursday accused the United States of \u201chijacking the global health body to create turmoil for China\u201d by advocating observer status at the World Health Assembly (WHA) for Taiwan.\u201cThe world\u2019s superpower is obstinate in applying every possible tool \u2013 Taiwan\u2019s WHA bid, Hong Kong national security bill, Xinjiang\u2019s vocational education and training center, the COVID-19 pandemic, etc. \u2013 to create a nuisance for China, a rising socialist country that it deems as a geopolitical rival,\u201d China\u2019s state-runCGTN Newsshrieked.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWe really need MAGAism back in Washington.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}

That amounts to more than one million people who became Republicans compared to about 630,000 who became Democrats.A lack of direction by the Democratic Party is contributing to its slide. The AP report states:Roughly four months before Election Day, Democrats have no clear strategy to address Biden\u2019s weak popularity and voters\u2019 overwhelming fear that the country is headed in the wrong direction with their party in charge.\u00a0And while Republicans have offered few policy solutions of their own, the GOP has been working effectively to capitalize on the Democrats\u2019 shortcomings.Republicans benefited last year as suburban parents grew increasingly frustrated by prolonged pandemic-related schools closures. And as inflation intensified more recently, the Republican National Committee has been hosting voter registration events at gas stations in suburban areas across swing states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania to link the Biden administration to record-high gas prices. The GOP has also linked the Democratic president to an ongoing baby formula shortage.\u201cBiden and Democrats are woefully out of touch with the American people, and that\u2019s why voters are flocking to the Republican Party in droves,\u201d RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel told AP. She predicted that \u201cAmerican suburbs will trend red for cycles to come\u201d because of \u201cBiden\u2019s gas hike, the open border crisis, baby formula shortage and rising crime.\u201dThis is not the first time Democrats have been warned of a voting catastrophe awaiting in this year\u2019s midterms.As Breitbart News reported last month,\u00a0the Democrats are \u201cin shellacking territory.\u201dPresident Joe Biden is in no better personal territory.The president is underwater on almost every key issue as the midterm elections loom closer, a\u00a0Redfield & Wilton Strategies surveyreportedby Breitbart News reveals.Biden\u2019s overallapproval ratingis dying, as 35 percent approve and 43 percent disapprove.That gives him a net negative approval of -8 percent. Even so, that is still far better than his current RealClearPolitics spread, which sits at -15.1 as of last Monday.Notably, Biden fails to perform much better on individual issues. There is only one category that Biden sees a positive net approval \u2014 the coronavirus pandemic, as 39 percent approve and 37 percent disapprove. He lacks a positive net approval on any other issue.Even as voters turn away from the Democrats and look on Biden with increasing disdain, AP reports the broad migration of more than one million voters, a small portion of the overall U.S. electorate, does not ensure widespread Republican success in the November midterm elections.The details about party switchers however does present a dire warning for Democrats.Biden supporters are increasingly concerned about the macro effects shaping the political landscape this fall and their party\u2019s wayward, even helpless response, to key voter concerns including soaring inflation, rising interest rates and rents,\u00a0the open border crisis, national baby formula shortage and rising crime.Put simply, the public isn\u2019t buying what the Democratic Party is selling.Follow Simon Kent on Twitter:Follow @SunSimonKentor e-mail to: skent@breitbart.com\n\n# News comment directly above the focal comment:\n5899992964\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSuper dog is still up voting his own comments.

NBC News reported the FBI admitted the bureau did provide \u201ccompanies with \u2018foreign threat indicators\u2019 to help protect their platforms and customers, but that it \u2018cannot ask, or direct, companies to take action on information received.'\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0FBI routinely notifies U.S. private sector entities, including social media providers, of potential threat information, so that they can decide how to better defend against threats,\u201d the bureautoldNBC News.On Thursday, Facebook\u2019s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the\u00a0FBIwarnedFacebook of an imminent \u201cdump\u201d of \u201cRussian propaganda\u201d shortly before the Hunter Biden \u201claptop from hell\u201d story broke, causing the story to be shared on the platform to a less \u201cmeaningful\u201d degree.\u201cThe FBI, I think basically came to us \u2014 some folks on our team and was like, \u2018Hey, um, just so you know, like, you should be on high alert. There was the \u2014 we thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election,\u201d Zuckerberg explained to Joe Rogan. \u201cWe have it on notice that basically there\u2019s about to be some kind of dump of \u2014 that\u2019s similar to that. So just be vigilant.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe just kind of thought, Hey look, if the FBI, which, you know, I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, it\u2019s a very professional law enforcement,\u201d Zuckerberg continued. \u201cThey come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something. Then I wanna take that seriously.\u201dWhen pressed by Rogan, Zuckerberg acknowledged the story was authentic.\u00a0 \u201cYeah. I mean, it sucks. I mean, it turned out after the fact, I mean the fact-checkers looked into it, no one was able to say it was false, right. So basically it had this period where it was getting less distribution.\u201dWhile the FBI was communicating with Facebook, the FBI\u2019s\u00a0 leadership forbade agents frominvestigatingHunter Biden\u2019s laptop until after the 2020 election was decided, according to whistleblowers that came forward to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). The whistleblowers said the FBI did not want to investigate the laptop because it was afraid public disclosure would alter the outcome of the 2020 election:After the FBI obtained the Hunter Biden laptop from the Wilmington, DE computer shop, these whistleblowers stated that local FBI leadership told employees, \u201cyou will not look at that Hunter Biden laptop\u201d and that the FBI is \u201cnot going to change the outcome of the election again.\u201d Further, these whistleblowers allege that the FBI did not begin to examine the contents of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop until after the 2020 presidential election\u2014potentially a year after the FBI obtained the laptop in December 2019.Polling shows the shenanigans surrounding Hunter\u2019s \u201claptop from hell\u201d impacted the 2020 election. Seventy-four percent of Americans believe the FBI misled the public when it claimed Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop was \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Seventy-nine percent of Americanssayformer President Donald Trump would have won reelection in 2020 if Hunter\u2019s laptop had been known to voters. When Americans were asked if they \u201cagreed or disagreed the electorate did not have access to information that could have been critical to their decision at the polls,\u201d 78 percent agreed. Twelve percent disagreed.Hunter Biden is the subject of a brand new narrative filmMy Son Hunter,marking Breitbart\u2019s expansion into film distribution.

Liz Cheney (R-WY) wrote in the report,ignoringthe days and events leading up to January 6.\u201cDuring this time, law enforcement agents were attacked and seriously injured, the Capitol was invaded, the electoral count was halted and the lives of those in the Capitol were put at risk,\u201d Cheney continued. \u201cIn addition to being unlawful, as described in this report, this was an utter moral failure\u2014and a clear dereliction of duty.\u201dNot all Republicans agree with Cheney\u2019s claims. She lost her Republican primary in August by nearly 40 points after participating on the January 6 Committee.On Wednesday, House Republicansreleasedtheir own report, which shed light on how the Capitol\u2019s security was left vulnerable to massive crowds. The report found Democrat House leadership and law enforcement leaders in the Capitol Police were quite worried about the \u201coptics\u201d of any enhanced Capitol security before the protest.\u201cLeadership and law enforcement failures within the U.S. Capitol left the complex vulnerable on January 6, 2021. The Democrat-led investigation in the House of Representatives, however, has disregarded those institutional failings that exposed\u00a0the Capitol to violence that day,\u201d the Republicans wrote.The Republicans\u2019 report also stated the Capitol Police were made aware of security threats to the Capitol on January 6 dating back to mid-December.\u201cPrior to that day, the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) had obtained sufficient information from an array of channels to anticipate and prepare for the violence that occurred,\u201d the report said.The Republican report was crafted by Reps. Jim Banks (R-IN), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Rodney Davis (R-IL), Troy Nehls (R-TX), and Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) \u2014 all members whom Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) had appointed to the January 6 Committee, but some of whom Pelosi denied participation, such as Jordan and Banks. McCarthy later removed all the appointees in protest of Pelosi\u2019s decision to block Jordan and Banks.Banks believes the report serves as evidence of Pelosi\u2019s \u201cleading role\u201d in the Capitol\u2019s security failures.\u201cOur report exposes the partisanship, incompetence and indifference that led to the disaster on January 6 and the leading role Speaker Pelosi and her office played in the security failure at the Capitol,\u201d BankstoldJust the News. \u201cUnlike the sham January 6th Committee, House Republicans produced a useful report that will keep Capitol and USCP officers safe with no subpoena power and no budget.\u201dIn the January 6 Committee\u2019s report, Pelosi appeared to reject any responsibility for the lack of Capitol security.Pelosi stated the partisan committee \u201csucceeded in bringing clarity\u201d to the riot by \u201cinvestigating the facts, circumstances and causes that led to this domestic terror attack on the Capitol.\u201d\u201cWe owe a debt of gratitude to Chairman Bennie Thompson, Vice Chair Liz Cheney, the patriotic Members of Congress and dedicated staff\u2014who devoted themselves to this investigation, to uncovering the truth and to writing a report that is a \u2018Roadmap for Justice,'\u201d Pelosi concluded.Follow Wendell Huseb\u00f8 onTwitter@WendellHuseb\u00f8.

Patrick McHenry (R-NC) said in a statement provided to Breitbart News when asked about the diversity language that the committee plans to prioritize \u201ckitchen table issues.\u201dMcHenry indicated that would be a contrast to the focus of Democrats, who he said had spent the last two Congresses pressuring companies until they \u201cparroted their woke social agenda.\u201d\u201cFor four years, Democrats wasted the valuable and limited time and resources of our committee to push burdensome mandates on American job creators. Democrats\u2019 goal was to name and shame companies until they parroted their woke social agenda,\u201d McHenry said.\u00a0 \u201cUnder my leadership, Republicans will refocus the Committee on the kitchen table issues that matter most to American families, from charting a path out of the dismal Biden economy to expanding opportunities for all Americans.\u201d\u201cDiversity and inclusion\u201d are nevertheless listed as priorities under all six of the committee\u2019s subcommittees, a discovery firstreportedFriday by the right-leaning Washington Free Beacon in a story titled \u201cWoke Agenda Survives: These House Republicans Are Sticking With \u2018Diversity and Inclusion.\u2019\u201dThe conservative group FreedomWorks also raised the alarm on the Democrat buzzwords, noting they are a \u201cpillar\u201d of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, a trend among powerful left-aligned Wall Street investors topushclimate and diversity initiatives.New to the committee is Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), one of five black Republican members of Congress, a member of the Freedom Caucus, and a candidate for House speaker during the contentious speaker race at the start of the year.Donalds, who previously had a longtime career in finance and banking, told Breitbart News in a statement the committee\u2019s plan was \u201cfar from the road of woke policies like ESG investing\u201d but stood by the focus on \u201cdiversity and inclusion,\u201d noting they were a means to \u201ctruly mobilize and amplify people rather than practice placation.\u201dRead Donalds\u2019 full statement below:As a new member of the House Financial Services Committee, one of my many goals is to expand access to capital, break down barriers that prevent underrepresented communities from participating in our markets, and create pathways for economic prosperity for traditionally unbanked and underbanked members of our society as well as the entire middle and working class. Chairman McHenry shares this goal, and I have complete confidence in his agenda for the committee. The diversity and inclusion we plan on addressing are far from the road of woke policies like ESG investing or virtual signaling on Wall Street, and any suggestion otherwise is misleading. It is beyond time for our country to look at diversity and inclusion as a way to truly mobilize and amplify people rather than practice placation.Upon taking control of the committee, McHenry had appeared to move away from Democrats\u2019 race-focused social causes by eliminating the\u00a0Diversity and Inclusion Subcommittee, which had been established by former chair Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) in 2019.Waters said she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the move and that McHenry\u2019s decision to instead include diversity under the jurisdiction of every subcommittee was \u201csimply insufficient.\u201dBreitbart News reached out to other Republican committee members, including Housing and Insurance Subcommittee chair Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) and Capital Markets Subcommittee chair Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO), but did not receive a response.Sean Moran contributed to this report.Write to Ashley Oliver ataoliver@breitbart.com.

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) would be as president.Johnson said, \u201cIt was important for the NAACP and other organizations to speak for individuals who are under attack. We have a large membership base in the state of Florida who feel besieged upon. Unfortunately, the governor is using his platform to advance some of the most regressive racist policies in his attempt to become the president of the United States.\u201dCabrera said, \u201cBut Florida isn\u2019t alone in passing controversial legislation. Texas, for example, passed a law restricting Critical Race Theory. There have been book bans in several states. Several states restricted voting rights. Why is the NAACP focusing specifically on Florida?\u201dJohnson said, \u201cYou have an individual leaning towards running for the presidency, and the nation must be aware and be cautious that. If we decide to move in this direction, it would take us backwards to the Trump years and to the 1950s. This is for individuals across the country to be clearly aware of how harmful this individual would be if, in fact, he occupied the White House.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter@pamkeyNEN\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nMaybe he will be offering Chicago as a safe haven for 8lack people.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Muslims\n\u2022Government spending\n\u2022Green energy\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Breitbart\n\u2022NSA\n\u2022Trump\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022CIA\n\u2022Police (cops)\n\u2022Higher taxes\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Obama\n\u2022The press\n\u2022California\n\u2022God\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022FBI\n\u2022White people\n\u2022MSNBC\n\u2022Texas\n\u2022Jesus\n\u2022The church\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Mueller\n\u2022Fox News\n\u2022Mexicans\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022CNN\n\u2022Fake news\n\u2022Economic growth\n\u2022Fossil fuelsImmigration / immigrants\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Climate change\n\u2022Edward Snowden\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Obamacare\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR\n    - If it is against the target, write AGAINST\n    - If it is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### Explanation ### \n    Together with the stance for a given target, provide evidence-based reasoning that quotes or references specific text from the comment that reveals the commenter's stance toward the target.\n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": <one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]\n          \"explanation\": [\"atomic argument\", \"atomic argument\", ...]\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_model": {"$defs": {"CommentStanceCT": {"properties": {"target": {"title": "Target", "type": "string"}, "stance": {"title": "Stance", "type": "string"}, "stance_type": {"title": "Stance Type", "type": "string"}, "explanation": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Explanation", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["target", "stance", "stance_type", "explanation"], "title": "CommentStanceCT", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"results": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/CommentStanceCT"}, "title": "Results", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["results"], "title": "FullStancesCT", "type": "object"}}}
