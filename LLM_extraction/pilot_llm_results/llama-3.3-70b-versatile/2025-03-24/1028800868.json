  "article_body": "On Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)suggestedthat Fox News host Brian Kilmeade was Islamaphobic because he said that Syrian opposition groups shouting \u201cAllahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar!\u201d as rockets hit government offices demonstrated Islamist influence among the opposition.\u201cI have a problem helping those people screaming that after a hit,\u201d Kilmeade said. McCain responded: \u201cWould you have a problem with an American or Christians saying \u2018thank God? Thank God?'\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re saying. Come on! Of course they\u2019re Muslims, but they\u2019re moderates and I guarantee you they are moderates.\u201d McCain provided no evidence to suggest that Syrian opposition groups are moderate, as opposed to the wide swath of evidence suggesting that the opposition is heavily infested with al Qaeda.Ben Shapiro is Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the New York Times bestseller \u201cBullies: How the Left\u2019s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America\u201d\u00a0(Threshold Editions, January 8, 2013).",
