I am glad they are here wasting their money....it is spent on trolls who must really need the money and it isn't being used to purchase more politicians.....and it isn't changing anybody's mind here so they are spinning their wheels for nothing.


And obviously, whoever is paying for it, must think that Mother Jones is a serious threat to the GOP. If they thought that we were harmless here, they wouldn't bother with us.

So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.

        Uh, Gruber is a Liberal who called other Liberals idiots.
Judging by your Post, he was quite correct.

                  isn't this funny how many trolls showed up today? Somebody is really upset by the fact that the ACA is working. If I was still a republican, I would admit that it was a republican plan to begin with, similar to what Romney passed, and take credit for the success.....at least the GOP would have SOMETHING going for them.


The ACA must be working better than any of us thought if the paymasters are willing to shell out this much money for trolls. This is just too funny.
