One really can't overstate what a lying, cowardly piece of scum Bill O'Reilly is, he's a classic republican/conservative chicken hawk .

PARENT COMMENT:
Come-on Bill.  Come clean.  Quit bullshitting us for cripes-sake.  
Answer the questions about why so many are saying that you embellished 
war stories.  Like Brian Williams did, you added copious amounts of 
heroics and survival of life threatening combat situations which never 
happened.  You really need to do a thorough examination of your 
conscience. You aren't a journalist any more. You now stand accused of 
being a phony and an imposter. You are widely regarded as a sleazy, propaganda
 spewing whore for a notoriously corrupt disinformation service. You and
 your FOX colleagues are loathed by honest news people with solid 
ethics. You are wholly ignored by those who are well educated and 
intelligent enough to recognize when they are deliberately being 
misinformed. You are a such disgrace. Now, because "What goes around; 
comes around" you've made yourself a casualty of what should have 
brought you down long ago. Namely, the pompous way that your staunchest 
critics allege that you purposefully lie to the audience. You pretend to
 be our hero. But, you are merely a coward wanting a Purple Heart for a 
self inflicted wound. You've been caught red-handed and exposed many 
times before. Soon, the conclusive evidence you have boldly lied and 
deliberately distorted the truth will emerge. You are opposite anything 
anywhere near being "Fair and balanced". You are very close to finally 
being exposed as both pathological and delusional. You probably consider
 yourself a role model. But, the sad truth of the matter is what you 
really are is simply, ... bad example.
