There is a reason people like me insist on study and data. Its too bad you get to reap all the benefits study and data collection has afforded you in your everyday life (not even talking vaccinations here) yet you are ignorant enough to trivialize an entire field of study into "hey, I poked around the internet and determined you are obviously wrong"

It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

OMG, the level of arrogant ignorance here is frightening.  This whole "herd immunity" thing was made up by the people who are spoon feeding you your daily dose of brainwashing via the already bought off media, and the "authorities."   The information against vaccines was originally found in medical journals and public health records.  I would not be at all surprised if those are being tweaked now, but before the vaccine mongers got very sophisticated, that is where we were able to get our information.  The books, many of them written by doctors, were, and are, heavily suppressed.  Those of us who came across a bit of information really had to do intensive digging and searching to find the rest of it. Now that we have information more accessible on the Internet, those vested interests who kept the books out of the bookstores are now resorting to attacks and smears on the truth.  Does anyone think that the doctors who share the truth get anything out of it?  No, they are attacked, smeared, threatened, have had their licences pulled.  So why would they risk all of that?  Because they are, unlike most of the population, dedicated to telling the truth, come what may.    Any intelligent person can look up the ingredients of vaccines, see what each of those ingredients effects are on the body, and see for themselves that there is NOTHING in them that produces health and immunity, but plenty that damages, and sometimes destroys, immune systems.  Don't just take my word for it, or anyone else's.  Investigate the information thoroughly from both sides.  You owe yourself and your children that.

If its so obvious why did you need to try and find studies or data to verify your position?
