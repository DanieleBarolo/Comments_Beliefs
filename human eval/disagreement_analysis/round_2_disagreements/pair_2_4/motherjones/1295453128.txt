Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

I have been a hobbyist for many years. I have sworn that I will never set foot in HL, and I never have.  I also have many friends who are hobbyists, and they have all sworn not to buy anything from them.  If they want personhood for their fictitious, legally-created entity, based on the religious beliefs of the majority owners, then they should be willing to support having their owners sued individually for torts or contract breaches.  Once a corporation (and its owners) are subject to the same 'obligations & responsibilities' of a human being, including the death penalty (HL is HQ'd in Oklahoma, a death penalty state), then they can have full personhood!

  You hit the nail on  your head: you don't have to shop there if you don't like their views. You don't have to work there if you don't like their views. Frankly, if a person has any spine at all, they'd <I>refuse</I> to work for any business they had this sort of quarrel with.

You don't, however, have the right to tell them what their views must be or to tell them they cannot follow those beliefs.

    Milo...you, too, have "hit the proverbial nail on the head." By "they", I assume you're referring to the owners (real human beings) of HL. Of course they have the right to believe whatever they wish...AS HUMAN BEINGS.  Corporations, on the other hand, are fictitious entities, created for purposes of business and industry, unless they are non-profit, religious organizations that profess to a certain religion or spiritual belief system.  Last I heard, HL is not a non-profit or religious organization.  Further, when a business incorporates, it acknowledges that it may do anything that is not unlawful, not based on it's non-existent beliefs. So, in essence, since the ACA is the law, the corporation known as HL, cannot act contrary.  It's a simple exercise of Logic 101 from college freshman year!!

      It would be that simple if you thought like a freshman, I agree. For grown ups, I'd go a step further. It is a corporation, but one where clearly the management subscribes to this philosophy. That is their right. Why would you choose to infringe on their beliefs?
As I asked earlier, if you felt these people were so terrible, why would you work or shop there?

        Management's "philosophy" is not protected from federal law. They can't have a philosophy of not hiring women, or asians, or only hiring 12-year-olds. A corporate "philosophy" only goes as far as state and federal regulations allow.


And HL's "philosophy" flies directly in the face of federal law. Even freshmen can grasp this, Milo.

          But we aren't speaking of racial discrimination, or child labor laws, are we? No, we are speaking of their right to practice their religion which is also protected.

            Come on, Milo. You can't be this simple-minded. Their right to practice their religion does not trump federal law. I can't believe I actually have to type this; federal laws that restrict religious practices have been in place for decades, and are completely Constitutional.


Your religious practices aren't protected just because they are religious practices.

              What "federal law" would you consider higher that the Constitution of the United States?
Frankly, I'm surprised I had to remind you the first amendment exists.
