Trump has been trying to help protect us from this and liberals have overuled him at every step.

The Sudanese immigrant who shot up a White Christian Church in Tennessee, now we see this horrific attack.

You liberal sanctuary city appeasers are to blame for this carnage!

The 9th Circuit should feel proud they stopped our President from protecting our homeland.

Sickening!!
