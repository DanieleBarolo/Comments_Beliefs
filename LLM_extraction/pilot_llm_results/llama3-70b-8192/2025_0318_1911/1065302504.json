  "article_body": "Bob Woodward: \u201c[Obama] said he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling. A reasonable position. \u2018I will not be blackmailed,\u2019 he said. But he should be talking. They should be meeting, discussing this, because as I think Steve Ratner showed earlier, the American economy is at stake and the president, if there is a downturn or a collapse or whatever could happen here, that\u2019s bad, it\u2019s going to be on his head. The history books are going to say, we had an economic calamity in the Presidency of Barack Obama. Speaker Boehner, indeed, is playing a role on this. Go back to the Great Depression in the 1930s. I\u2019ll bet no one can name who was the Speaker of the House at the time. Henry Thomas Rainey. He\u2019s not in the history book; it\u2019s on the president\u2019s head. He\u2019s got to lead. He\u2019s got to talk. And the absence of discussion here, I think, is baffling element.\u201d",

Also, because he and his wife hate this country, why try to negotiate with\nCongress? He prefers to play golf and drink beer. I hope the low info voters are\nfinally paying attention: Obama does not feel your PAIN!! His life's too good to bother\nabout you!!!",
