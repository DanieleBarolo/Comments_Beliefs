  "article_body": "The chairman of Barilla Pasta, the world\u2019s leading pasta manufacturer, weathered calls for a consumer boycott against him Thursday after telling Italian radio his company would never use a homosexual family in its ads.A report from Reuters in Romesaidthat Guido Barilla, 55, chairman of one of the best-known pasta brands around the world and one of Italy\u2019s biggest advertisers, told Radio 24 he is opposed to adoption by gay parents but in favor of allowing gay marriage, though it is illegal in Italy.In response to a direct question about whether he would feature a \u201cgay family\u201d in his company\u2019s commercials, Barilla said, \u201cI would never do (a commercial) with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect but because we don\u2019t agree with them. Ours is a classic family where the woman plays a fundamental role.\u201dBarilla\u2019s hallmark symbol for many years has been the image of a happy family countryside, with the slogan, \u201cWhere there\u2019s Barilla, there\u2019s home.\u201d\u201cFor us, the sacral family remains one of the company\u2019s core values,\u201d Barilla said. \u201cOur family is a traditional family. If gays like our pasta and our advertising, they\u2019ll eat our pasta, if they don\u2019t like it they will eat someone else\u2019s brand,\u201d hestated, according to the Huffington Post. \u201cI would not do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect toward homosexuals \u2013 who have the right to do whatever they want without disturbing others \u2013 but because I don\u2019t agree with them and I think we want to talk to traditional families.\u201dAurelio Mancuso, head of gay rights group Equality Italia, called Barilla\u2019s remarks an \u201coffensive provocation\u201d and urged a boycott of the company\u2019s pasta, sauces, and snacks.\u201cWe accept the invitation from the Barilla owner to not eat his pasta,\u201d Mancusosaid, sparking support for a boycott on social media.Alessandro Zan, a gay member of parliament, tweeted, \u201cYou can\u2019t mess around with consumers, including gay ones.\u201dOn Thursday, Barilla issued a statement, explaining that he was trying to say \u201csimply that the woman plays a central role in a family.\u201d\u201cBarilla features families in its commercials because it embraces anyone, and they have always been identified with our brand,\u201d he said.\u201cI apologize if my words generated misunderstandings or controversy or if they hurt some people\u2019s feelings,\u201d Barilla wrote on the company\u2019s Facebook page Thursday, according to theHuffington Post.In Barilla\u2019s latest ad for its Mulino Bianco cookies and breakfast cakes, Spanish film star Antonio Banderas is featured baking biscuits with children and talking to a chicken named Rosita.According to theHuffington Post, Italy \u201clags\u201d behind the U.S. \u201con gay rights, with attitudes toward homosexuality complicated by the country\u2019s strong ties to the Catholic church.\u201dBarilla Pasta was founded in 1877 in Parma, Italy, and now exports to more than 100 countries. The company had about $5.4 billion in net sales worldwide in 2012 and employs more than 13,000 people.",
