  "parent_text": "Glad to have Greta earlier.  Who needs Shep at that hour?  10pm is too late for me.  The workday begins very early.\n\n\nO'Reilly becomes more unwatchable with every passing day.  He's nowhere near as smart as he thinks he is.  He starts yelling if you don't agree with him.  His middle-of-the-road routine is tiresome and leads to the blandest, dullest segments.  I have to think that a big part of his ratings are just people on autopilot.  Nowhere else to go at 8pm.\n\n\nHannity, take him or leave him.  Depends on his guests.  Megyn is very good and very smart, but I did catch a segment she did some months ago about working moms and she was like O'Reilly, if you didn't agree with her she attacked you.  I just felt she was being dishonest because with the choices she's made in her life, she has to believe that children are in no way affected by having working moms.  Understand, I'm not taking a stand, I'm just saying that that discussion is like talking about racism.  You can't be honest because you'll be denounced as a misogynist if you deviate from the party (feminist) line that women working outside the home is always a great choice and women who prefer to stay at home are lacking.  As long as we cannot talk about these issues, we can never resolve problems.",
