Can it be improved?  Absolutely.  Let's do it.


However, one entire political party wants nothing more than to scrap it totally.  Their alternative?  Give tax breaks to millionaires.

So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.

  We get to see if he interprets laws as written or as fools who hastily pass 2000 page bills might have wanted them to be written in retrospect.
