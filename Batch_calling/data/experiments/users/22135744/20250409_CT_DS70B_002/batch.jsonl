Then the deed will be done, and America in the long term will be toast, overrun with future Democrat voters who will multiply, criminals, terrorists, drugs and debt.\n\nThe Harris-Biden puppet masters have instructed their minions to just play,<i> \"Border crisis? There's a border crisis? Don't be melodramatic. I'm sure it'll blow over.\"</i> Biden points to Harris to \"handle\" and Harris immediately goes AWOL for 32 days and counting. Circular finger pointing runaround as America is overrun. All per anti-American design.\n\nPlay deaf, dumb and blind a few more months, and the deed will be done. Nothing can stop them. R's can loudly yap impotently, now that they PUNTED when they had actual power to DO something and Stop the Steal. Our third branch judiciary seems as intimidated as the Chauvin jury by D's violent mob of street thugs. Trump was routinely obstructed by the judiciary, but nothing but clear sailing for Biden and his lawless EO's.\n\nBy the way, stop to reflect that the criminal cartels are getting filthy rich off the dissolution of our border. While doing that, consider that the China Communists work hand in glove with the cartels -- to supply materials for fentanyl, to launder money and numerous profitable collaborations. \n\nReally, the DELIBERATE virus sharing and the burgeoning trade of lethal drugs is Communist China war by other means.\n\nSo Zho Xi-Den while decimating America not only enriches the vicious criminal cartels but also enriches his ruthless Communist China benefactors -- the ones who DELIBERATELY shared their virus in 2020 and changed the political trajectory in America enabling D's to seize power.\n\nOne anti-American hand washing the other and America swirls the bowl.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nBut Biden caused them overnight \ud83e\udd14\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhy not.
