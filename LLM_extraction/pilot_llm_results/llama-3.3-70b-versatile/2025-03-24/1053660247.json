  "article_body": "It is not themiddle classwho work at Walgreens \u2014 180,000 of whom justlost their health insurance. It is notthe upper-middle classwho lost hoursat their movie theatre jobs. And it is notthe Top 1%stymied and demoralized in a \u201crecovery\u201d that no longercreates full-time jobs. There is simply no question anymore that the victims of ObamaCare are legion, and mostly the working poor-those who live in that fragile place between the shame of welfare and the promise of the American Dream. And these are the people Ted Cruz is facing Hell for.And who is throwing all that Hell? The media and the very same rocket scientists in the Republican Establishment who told us only McCain and Romney could beat Barack Obama.The media won\u2019t even tell the story of how ObamaCare is currently bludgeoning the working poor. Because the media stand where they always stand \u2014 against The People and with The State, and its bureaucrats, and those who grow and defend both, like Barack Obama and the Democrats. And where does the GOP Establishment stand on this day? With the media.I was okay with the Establishment disagreeing with Cruz on tactics, but they are now joining the media in toxifying Cruz instead of aiding his righteous fight by explaining to their media pals and the American people just what exactly it is he is fighting for. This, even though the polls show the public is with Cruz in opposition to ObamaCare. Apparently, though, the Establishment only sees an opportunity to protect their shrinking turf.As I write these very words, 180,000 Walgreens\u2019 workers are trying to figure out how they are going to fare now that they have been thrown to the wolves of government exchanges, millions can\u2019t find a job, and who knows how many are losing the work hours that define the difference between making that week\u2019s bills or not. But what are the media giddy about today? What is Joe Scarborough puffing his sanctimonious face up about? Theprocessover Ted Cruz\u2019s fight for these people.But the GOP Establishment are not talking about them, and the very same media that just loves to pretend they care about our society\u2019s most vulnerable have once again made their choice between the poor and The State.Follow\u00a0 John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC",

  "parent_text": "Nice Headline, but no one in their right mind would believe that republicans give a damn about the working poor.  They voted to cut food stamp when they admit that people don't have jobs and hours are being cut.  So they expect them to feed themselves with what?  Every comment on every site I went with a conservative base was along the line of \"Well they are too fat anyway,\" \"They didn't cut enough.\"  or they should not get anything at all.  So to pretend that republicans care about the working poor is a bit of a stretch.",
