    Stance classification is the task of determining the expressed or implied opinion, or stance, of a statement toward a certain, specified target.
    Your task is to analyze the news comment, generate the main targets expressed by the user, and determine its stance towards the found targets. 
    A target should be the topic on which the comment is talking. 
    To help you in this task, you will be provided with a broader context where the comment happened. 
    You will have the title and body of the article, together with the time when the comment was posted. Also, if any, the news comment directly above the focal comment will be provided.

# News comment title:
McAuliffe Invested $47k in Venture of Donor Who Pled Guilty to Stealing Identities of Terminally Ill

# News comment article:
Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffeacknowledgedWednesday that he invested $47,000 in a business operated by Joseph Caramadre, who recently pled guilty to charges of “fraud, conspiracy, and identity theft” in a federal courtroom in Providence, Rhode Island.Earlier on Wednesday, theProvidence Journalreportedthat, according to federal prosecutors, Caramadre and his associates “stole identities of terminally ill people. They then used that information to purchase investments his clients profited from after the people died.”Accordingto Virginia’s NBC 12, “Caramadre was also a donor to McAuliffe’s failed 2009 bid for the Democratic nomination for governor of Virginia. Caramadre donated more than $26 thousand to McAuliffe and hosted a fundraiser for the candidate.”Terry McAuliffe was not indicted in the case, but theProvidence Journalreportedthat his name was on a list of investors in Caramadre’s admitted scheme, presented in court on Wednesday by federal prosecutors “in their effort to prove that Caramadre and his former employee, Raymour Radhakrishnan, caused more than $46 million in losses to insurance companies through an investment approach that used the identities of terminally ill people.”As part of his guilty plea, Caramadre has agreed to make restitution to his victims. The hearing Wednesday was to determine the amount of that restitution.Rhode Island’s NBC News 10 I-Teamreportedthat “there is no evidence that the investors knew that Caramadre was stealing the identities of the terminally ill patients.”McAuliffe campaign spokesperson Josh SchwerintoldNBC 12 “that McAuliffe and his campaign would donate the equivalent of the campaign donations from Caramadre to the American Cancer Society. $27 thousand from the campaign. $47 thousand from the candidate himself. The $27 thousand was to return campaign contributions. The $47 thousand was for the investment into Caramadre’s business venture.”

This man is despicable and yet he's ahead of his Republican rival in the polls? Are 
you kidding? This is how low America's standard has sunk? But then again, after
Obama, voters will vote the scum, low life. They could even crawl out from under 
a rock but with the help of the propaganda pushed by the communist/socialist media,
they have a good chance of winning. And America LOSES!

    ### Task Description ###

    1. Identify all the expressed targets from the user's comment. 
        - The targets can be a single word or a phrase, but its maximum length MUST be 4 words.

    2. For each target, determine the stance in the comment:
        2.1 Classify the Stance
            - If the stance is in favor of the target, write FAVOR.
            - If it is against the target, write AGAINST.
            - If it is ambiguous, write NONE - that means the user is clearly speaking about the topic but the stance is not clear. 

        2.2. Provide the stance type:
            - EXPLICIT: when the stance is directly stated in the comment
            - IMPLICIT: when the stance is implied but not explicitly stated

    2.3 Extract key claims
        - Extract the fundamental assertions or beliefs that form the basis of the commenter's stance
        - Each key claim should represent a distinct assertion presented as directly stated by the commenter
        - Express claims in direct form (e.g., "Climate change is accelerating due to human activities.") rather than reported speech (e.g., "The user said that climate change was accelerating due to human activities.")
        - DeprecationWarningistill the essential claims expressed in the comment text

    ### Output Format: ###

    You must output only JSON format:
    {
    "results": [
        {
        "target": "<target description - maximum 4 words>", 
        "stance": "<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE]>", 
        "stance_type": "<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT]>",
        "key_claims": "<[claim 1, claim 2, ...]>", 
        "explanation": "<explanation of how the key claims support the stance classification>"
        },
        // Repeat for each target expressed by the user's comment
    ]
    }

    ONLY return the JSON object itself.
