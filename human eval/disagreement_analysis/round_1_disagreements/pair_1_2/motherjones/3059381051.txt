". . .think and play defense, not offense, shine a light on the bad things that Trump et al. will try to do,. . ."

NYL, although I normally agree with you--it seems that, we on the left, have always played defense.  We've never had an offense.
tRump's flaws were obvious during the campaign.  His appointments are equally flawed.  How do you reason with the unreasonable? 
Yes, he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million;  yet, that means nothing to his minions, nor does it seem to matter to anyone in the Republican party, who first condemned him, then supported him.
How do we make a much needed change when the idiots, on the right, control it all?

We need to get our representatives to explain to their constituents that there was Russian hacking, and yes, it did compromise the election, and, yes, it did skew the election to t rump.  When will it become a given that states with the easiest voting process have the most progressive congressional delegations.  I fear that there is a movement afoot by conservatives to instigate easily detectable fraud in a state with mail in ballots in order to say, " see! see! Making voting easier makes fraud easier."  .

"The Tea Party's ideas were wrong and their behavior was often horrible....We are better than this."

As they used to say on Mythbusters......"Well there's your problem." If we (should have) learned anything from this most recent electoral debacle it's that taking the high road landed us smack in a political ditch from which it may take years or even decades to extricate ourselves. We got Trumped, Bannoned, Comeyed, Putined and in every way imaginable screwed six ways from Sunday by the nastiest campaign of white-is-right fear and loathing since George Wallace.

The only way to stop Trumpism is take the gloves off and get down in the mud with the plug-uglies on the uber right, and that poses a yuge problem because far too many younger voters, who represent the future of the liberal/progressive/independent movement, were already disengaged because they felt that the whole political process was irretrievably corrupted by "the boomers" and was not something they wanted to soil themselves by participating in. The "conservatives" knew that and used it to their advantage. 

Clearly, Trump's strategy was to be so nasty and so crazy-like-a-fox.....to lie constantly on a level that can only be described as a pathological Gish Gallop for the ages, that he'd depress voter turnout on the left. And it worked in large part because:

(1) The allegedly liberal MSM refused to go after him  until it was much too late, 
(2) The right wing media celebrated the Gallop instead of excoriating it, 
(3) The FBI refused to go after Trump's campaign for its ties to Russia and instead joined in the Clinton-bashing, and
(4) Most of all, too many voters on the left bought into his campaign of slander and character assassination and decided that Hillary Clinton just wasn't trustworthy enough to deserve their votes in spite of repeated warnings that a protest vote or an abstention could lead to exactly the kind of sociocultural and environmental calamity we're facing today. 

Republicans need to be hammered relentlessly for their continued willingness to sell out to the corporate greed, Christian extremism, rampant homophobia, militant misogyny and racist filth that are now the hallmarks of Trumpism. There are 686 days until election day in 2018, but the decision to abandon the high road and prepare to get the proverbial hair mussed needs to come today or nothing is going to change. Trump has lowered the bar and it's going to stay low from now on. That's an ugly truth but in politics as in all things, "why fix something that works?"

PARENT COMMENT:
OK, here's the Master Plan.  Become engaged, think and play defense, not offense, shine a light on the bad things that Trump et al. will try to do, obstruct the hasty rush to authoritarianism in the Executive Branch, remember that Trump lost the popular vote and most importantly let your US Senators and Reps know that you and many others are watching their actions very carefully... put their feet to the fire, so to speak... pat them on the back when they do the right thing.

Now, we need a name and an emblem... and some snappy slogans... and yeah, lots of money.
