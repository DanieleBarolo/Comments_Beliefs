  "article_body": "This is not a surprise \u2013 we\u2019ve been calling the administration\u2019s needless barrycades \u201cshutdown theater\u201d all week for a reason. We haven\u2019t forgotten how the Obama administration also usedham-fisted scare tactics in the wake of the Sequesterin an attempt to spur public outrage over the cuts in spending.This is how the Regime rolls. According to an anonymous Park Ranger, he and his fellow workers have been told to make life as difficult as possible for people.Wesley Pruden ofThe Washington Timesreported:The Park Service appears to be closing streets on mere whim and caprice. The rangers even closed the parking lot at Mount Vernon, where the plantation home of George Washington is a favorite tourist destination. That was after they barred the new World War II Memorial on the Mall to veterans of World War II. But the government does not own Mount Vernon; it is privately owned by the Mount Vernon Ladies\u2019 Association. The ladies bought it years ago to preserve it as a national memorial. The feds closed access to the parking lots this week, even though the lots are jointly owned with the Mount Vernon ladies. The rangers are from the government, and they\u2019re only here to help.\u201cIt\u2019s a cheap way to deal with the situation,\u201d an angry Park Service ranger in Washington says of the harassment. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201dThe Obama Regime expects the MSM to carry their water by blaming Republicans for all the pain caused by the government shutdown. But when stories like this one get out there, their \u201cblame the GOP\u201d narrative becomes somewhat less convincing.Hat tip:Weasel Zippers",
