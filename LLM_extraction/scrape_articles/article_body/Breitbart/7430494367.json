{"title": "Ramadan Rage 2019: Jihadis Massacre 364, Injure 404 in Two Weeks", "body": "Islamic terrorists have carried out an estimated 76 attacks in nearly 15 countries since the beginning of Ramadan this month, killing at least 364 people and injuring 404 others in the first two weeks of the holiest month for Muslims, a Breitbart News tally shows.That means, on average, jihadis killed at least 25 people and injured about another 30 each day since Ramadan began at sunset on May 5. This year, the holy period is expected to last through sundown on June 4.Breitbart News’countthis week covers the 14 days of May 6 through May 19.The tally includes a total of 768 casualties (364 deaths, 404 injuries) in 14 countries: Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Kenya, Somalia, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria.Afghan Taliban narco-jihadis surpassed their Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) rivals as the world’s chief perpetrators of terrorist attacks during Ramadan this year, with 29 attacks that killed 146 and wounded 156.ISIS closely trailed the Afghan Taliban with 23 assaults that resulted in 105 fatalities and 132 injuries.The Taliban is responsible for 40 percent of all fatalities while ISIS was behind an estimated 30 percent.Overall, the Taliban carried out nearly 40 percent (302) of all casualties, including injuries.Breitbart News found that, so far,Afghanistan(160 deaths, 189 injuries),Nigeria(50 deaths, 33 injuries) andIraq(46 deaths, 54 injuries) are the bloodiest countries during the holy month.Jihadis and other Islamistsencouragetheir followers and supporters to escalate attacks during the holy month, arguing that Allah exceptionally rewards martyrdom during Ramadan.The Afghan Talibanrejecteda Ramadan ceasefire offer by the Afghan government this month. Instead, Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the narco-jihadi group,proclaimed, “As jihad is … the best part of worship, doing it on Ramadan is rewarded more than in other months.”The vast majority of Ramadan attack victims are Muslims in Africa and the Middle East.Breitbart News primarily gleans its data for its Ramadan death tally from the Religion of Peacewebsite, but it also relies upon otherdatabasesas well as media and government reports.News outlets and officials may update some of the casualty figures as some of the wounded victims succumb to their injuries, potentially altering the count after Breitbart News publishes this report.Most Muslims follow the peaceful Ramadan tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset. Nevertheless, the number of attacks at the hands of jihadis tends to escalate during the month when compared to other times of the year.Breitbart News removed the May 11 attack in Pakistan by theethnic separatistgroup Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) as experts disagree on whether the group is primarily jihadist or secular separatist in nature.Breitbart News has documented the following
