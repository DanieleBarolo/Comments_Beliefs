I believe the future favors those who promote tolerance … who are open to differences and learn from everyone,” hesaid.Obama spent 10 days vacationing in his childhood home of Indonesia, visiting cultural and historical sites.“Indonesia is made of thousands of islands, hundreds of languages, scores of regions and ethnic groups. So my time here made me cherish and respect for people’s differences,” hesaid.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/07/01/obama-laments-absence-of-american-leadership-under-president-donald-trump/"}
