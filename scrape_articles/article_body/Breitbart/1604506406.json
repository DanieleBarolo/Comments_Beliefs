{"title": "NAACP: DOJ, Secret Service Should Investigate Rodeo Clown", "body": "On Tuesday, the Missouri State National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)issueda statement asking for federal involvement in the case of a rodeo clown who wore an Obama mask and then asked the crowd if they’d like to see Obama run down by a bull. “The activities at the Missouri State Fair targeting and inciting violence against our President are serious and warrant a full review by both the Secret Service and the Justice Department,” said State President Mary Ratliff. “Incidents involving individuals acting out with extreme violent behavior in movie theaters, schools, churches, political appearances, and outdoor events in general speaks volume to the irresponsible behavior of all the parties involved with the incendiary events at the Missouri State Fair.”Ratliff went on to condemn the state’s funding of the State Fair: “our Legislature has failed to support Medicare Expansion in Missouri, has consistently attempted to dismantle our Human Rights Commission, fail to adequately fund urban schools — (who) are predominately African American — yet they are subsidizing the Missouri State Fair to the tune of $400,000; we are calling for the subsidy to stop…[Governor Nixon’s] planned Pancake Breakfast for Thursday should be his ‘Last Supper’ at the Missouri State Fair in response to the racially intolerant attacks on his Commander in Chief.”", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/08/13/Missouri-NAACP-rodeo-clown"}
