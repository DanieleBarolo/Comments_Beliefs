This doesn't change until we all decide not to support what's become our version of a blood sport - the modern gladiatorial games where violence is exalted.  And that will probably never happen as long as the throngs continue buying tickets and filing into the stadiums every Saturday or Sunday.  The NFL is all about money, and as long as we keep feeding it to them, this continues to happen to players at all levels of the game.

But far too many know how to surf out via anonymous IP addresses.  E.G. I could log off, then in a matter of seconds, log back on with an IP address from any continent on Earth.  That's really old tech. that can easily be sidestepped anymore.  This issue will take more to solve - and the \"usual\" of simply \"requiring a 'real' name via Facebook, etc.\" won't even come close.  That will just make more income for a few already taking advantage of the web for their own, personal profit...\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

We have shipped just about every other manufacturing job to China, and gave those corporations a good deal for doing so, and about the only manufacturing we have left are the MIC contractors. We have to incessantly feed the beast to keep those jobs in our Representative's districts, so they can keep their campaign coffers full, so they can be reelected, so they can get more money for the MIC.  \n\n\n\nSee the vicious circle that we have built for ourselves, and that Eisenhower tried to warn us NOT to do?  No wonder no Republicans NEVER mention Eisenhower's name.  He also thought our country needed the best infrastructure in the world, which of course created millions of good paying jobs, so of course the right is now against repairing what was built thanks to Eisenhower, which would again create millions of good paying jobs. Our politicians should all have to take at least an Econ 101 class, before being allowed to run for office.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat's a clear testimony to the power of the military / industrial complex.

In this respect they are no different than the corn, wheat or any other Ag business you can think of. Plantable trees? Great idea and these farmers have those available too, but to say to harvest a tree planted with that specific purpose in mind is \"a few less trees being destroyed in the name of God\" is just wrong.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nSo... something you use a couple of weeks a year on a tree, that's not an issue unless you let your kid play with them and stick them - or her hands - in her mouth... is all of a sudden a huge health issue?

It's simply easier and cheaper to settle the lawsuits and continue raking in current profits than it is to change to an environmentally responsible and ethical business model.  (Less pay and perks to the executives that way.)  Not really all that hard to understand.

Stopping the pipeline will not stop the oil from getting to the refineries. Stopping the pipeline will put the oil on the rails and highways. Try thinking with logic instead of thinking with feelings and then maybe you hippies will actually accomplish something good.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nIF the people fighting the pipeline are able to stop it, then maybe they will move onto stopping the transport by rail and highways too. And at least one of our greatest sources of underground water will be saved from the potential leaks in the pipeline.\n\n\nThe oil industry, by not keeping equipment repaired and in the best working conditions, by cutting corners on safety measures, and by not taking full responsibility for paying for past leaks and spills only have themselves to blame.\n\n\nPast behavior is just too good of a predictor of future behavior.

Those things put people out of work.  I remember one single voice of protest and it was a movie where the owner of a restaurant was replacing the workers with machines (to make things better).  The waitress and the cashier  were being replaced, and the cook was very upset. The cook looks into the camera at the end of the movie, and asks when (not if), he would be next. I thought it was a warning for all of us that the future might be difficult.  I have a plan B which is to dress up in cute outfits and go downtown to the busy areas with my shoe-shine box if things ever get tight. Today, you have to have a plan B.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAutomation is a secondary problem. Since Reagan, the govt has redistributed several trillion taxpayer dollars upward, largely to corporations, always insisting that this is \"vital to job creation.\" We now have a fraction of the jobs, at worsening wages, and no safety net. Corporations continue to use this money to expand internationally, building factories outside the US, shipping out our jobs. There's nothing we can do about it.  We're living with the consequences of Reagan's deregulation frenzy, strongly supported by middle class America, and corporations have been pulling off the Great Bank Robbery of the US right under our noses.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhile I agree with what you are saying (that we can't simply keep paying out unemployment forever)... The real problem is that we still have an economy and culture that seems not to care about offering employment - with or without true, livable wages - to those who need to work, wish to work, etc.  Until we move beyond the fantasy that giving the rich everything they want will persuade them to \"trickle down\" more jobs (It wasn't true when Reagan made political \"hay\" out of it and it still isn't true now), we'll continue to have far too many people that are simply shut out of employment for convenience, profit, and greed - as insidious and damning as all of them are on the heads of those \"job creators.\"\n\n\nNot everyone is able to do what you - and I also - did and start a consulting business to keep our heads above water.  Eventually, the government will have to address this inequality on one side or the other: either propping up those who need the assistance or finally standing up to those whose greed and avarice are causing the very conditions that continue.

We're becoming a nation of freelancers.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThis is not complicated. Universities pay adjuncts less in salary and benefits and full-time faculty get relieved of having to teach freshman classes. It's all about self-interest. I am an ex-academic who saw this phenomenon first-hand. Universities kept churning out Ph.D.s despite the lack of any demand for them. The result? A lot of highly educated unemployed or underemployed folks. It is a huge scam that I am surprised has not gotten more attention in the media.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nVery true - and the MBA led the way to the \"cash cows\" that so many institutions now employ.  My own, in the field of religion, has been the proliferation of the \"DMin\" degree so that so many pastors, teachers, etc. can put the \"Dr.\" in front of the \"Rev\" on their cards.  Compared to the PhD's or ThD's in theology or other religious disciplines these are essentially throwaway degrees that make money and impart a faux prestige to those who spend the money for them, instead of actually doing the work required for a \"real\" doctoral degree.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Rush LImbaugh has built a career around it. It says that anytime something bad happens, the inversion of the historic reality must be true. Therefore, blacks were happy in the Jim Crow South (Duck Dynasty dimwit). Or slaves were happy (<i>but a Republican freed them!!!</i>). Ergo, unarmed teenagers were asking for it - hoodies and loud music, etc. \n\nWhat a convenient bunker from which to lob grenades into the moral consciousness of a distracted nation. Unabashed racists are vile. The Republican Party is vile for catering to them. And the parts of the nation where these mouthbreathers predominate are the most retrograde and unevolved entities in what passes for our civilization. The 21st century is leaving them behind and they know it. This is their last stand.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nAbsolutely!

If Zimmerman had NOT had a gun then he would have thought twice about going after Martin. Its the GUN that made Zimmerman feel justified. If he had stayed in his vehicle and let the police handle the matter and not gone vigilante then there would have been none of the discussion.

And even choose which brands of fossil fuel I will or will not purchase.  Frankly?  You just sound lazy and want to justify that with all the invective you hurl out at anyone else.  Isn't it easy to call other people hypocrites without looking at yourself?  (Especially someone willing to invest in the tobacco industry?  Wow... no words really suffice...)\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I honestly had not thought of the point you bring up but have certainly dealt with my own issues with those \"commenters\" that seem to simply be picking a fight or engaging in other behaviors more descriptive of a middle-school bully on the playground than anything we normally associate with adult behavior.  That's primarily why I use my screen name instead of my own and never will participate in the Facebook driven comment forums again.  (Anonymous letters in my home mailbox and phone calls in the middle of the night after expressing my opinion in the letters to the editor of my home town newspaper under my \"real\" name cured me of that - ironically?  Expressing my own pro-choice opinions in North Carolina where so many so called \"pro-life\" folks seemed to think it was OK to threaten me or my family for sharing my opinions openly.)\n\nBut with the given that I've created my own on-line persona, with my own website for sharing that (that I haven't much used yet), I'm OK with folks knowing where I'm coming from.  They've got almost 3,000 comments that'll give them a pretty good picture of what I think and what's important to me.  I guess I can see your point, but beyond the measures I've taken for what appeared to be real, present threats, I'm OK with anyone knowing exactly where I'm coming from.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They need to save their jobs. Saving tax dollars does not fit in with the priority set for by the corporation. There is no room in this plan for helping keep people out of prison which would cut profits.\n\n\nThat same thing has happened with the privatization of our military. We pay more, war is drug out from being sold as \"6 months or less\" to 10 yrs........and instead of costing \"less than 1 billion\", it was over 4-5 billion per week of tax dollars going into the pockets of the rich.\n\n\nThe profit seekers don't care that our money is being wasted, that it is our sons and daughters who are dying in war, or that they are making life worse in the US for the majority of our citizens.\n\n\nWe are being told to want less from government and put our trust in the profit seekers, who only care about their bottom line. This is what the libertarians and republicans are calling to get government out of our lives for......so the rich will get richer.\n\n\nAnother thing to consider, is each quarter a corporation wants a larger percent of profits. There is no way this can happen unless we spend even less on the things the government needs to do. Our taxes can not be cut. They will have to go up in order to keep the profit seekers happy.

They never said a word after 13+ embassy attacks under Bush. They never said a word after thousands of lives lost in Iraq. If Bengazi is such an issue, why then were these people silent to this day about these issues. It's very obvious it's not about Bengazi, it's about hatred for the Pres and Hillary and their stated attempt to make him fail. Where is the outcry over dozens of deaths in schools and movie theaters? All these lives are of less importance than those in Bengazi. Nobody is denying that what happened there was a tragedy and we all grieve when an American is lost. However, if this be the case, all lives are of equal value. Additionally, why is there blanket criticism of some type of universal health care. After all, approx 1,000 people die every week due to lack of ability to afford medical care. We all know ACA has its problems but how about finding mutual solutions rather than simply say NO. The so called caring of people is reflected in the GOP's policies and voting records. No concern for those struggling especially children and vets. In fact, they detest the struggling. Michelle Bachman even had the gall to state \"if you don't work, you shouldn't eat\" as if every person unemployed is a lazy moocher. You'd think these people were entitled to benefits without working at jobs in which they were terminated for whatever reason. Sorry to be off topic, however, the calls of concern for the four deaths in Bengazi makes no sense when you look at the big picture proving this isn't about life, it's about politics.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt's actually creepy enough that it's one more reason why I'll never go the Facebook comment route on any website and post a thing under my real name.

There are ways to raise livestock on grass and what they can forage naturally that are as cost-effective and as profitable as the factory farm model. I've been on farms that do pasture-raised pork. Guess what - you don't smell much of anything when the animals have that much space to move around, find food, and be pigs.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhat the hell do you think \"typos\" are if they aren't spelling errors?

Is this another sign of how different and polarized Americans are becoming, getting more pacifist on one end of population spectrum at same time the other end getting more vengeful or even sadistic per these botched executions evidence?

That's long enough so that congressional representatives can build up experience and do good legislating, but short enough so that you actually get Congress turning over for new people every generation. \n\nMost representatives are in their thirties and forties at the earliest when they start the job anyways, so if they stay the full time, they'll be \"retiring\" around the normal retirement age anyways. It also might be good to come up with some type of official part-time advisory role, so that former Congress-folk can help newer ones with legislating without simply being drawn into the lobbying machine (although that does open the possibility of \"puppet seats\"). \n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI never understood term limits: the voters have the power to limit any term---just vote against the incumbent. If people are unwilling to do that, perhaps the incumbent is not so bad.\n\n\nThe underlying problem is that Americans, by and large, refuse to vote. Rather than using term limits (and I'm for NO term limits), we should:\n\n\n(a) Make election day a mandatory national holiday with only essential services allowed to operate; and \n\n\n(b) Follow the Australian model of assessing a $20 fine for not voting unless the non-voter can offer a legitimate reason (e.g., hospitalized in traffic accident suffered en route to polling place or the like). Perhaps even make that a $50 fine.\n\n\nOf course, the GOP practice of not providing sufficient voting booths and/or limiting voting hours unreasonably should carry criminal penalties of 3-5 years in prison.\n\nI do like 20-year staggered terms for Scotus, so that a couple of appointments (on average) fall within each 4-year presidential term. [edit: slip of the keyboard....]\n\nAnd we desperately need public financing of elections---elections run with ONLY public money: level the playing field, and keep corporations from buying legislators.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI completely agree with Kevin Drum's closing thought:  Moderation is always better than the extremes so often trotted out from either the right or the left.  But the article fails to mention the out of proportion influence of paid lobbyists and \"outside\" money that begins to hit as soon as anyone is elected to national office.  Term limits - moderate ones - are a good start; but until the power of money is addressed - and perhaps the Citizens United ruling is over turned?  It won't much matter anyway.  The corruption of so much \"promised\" for the votes currently asked for will continue; and the United States will continue its decline into more and more of a corporatocracy.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Why didn't they seek out the perpetrators? Why weren't the cops called?\n\n\nThe answer to all of these things are because of HOW the claim was handled by \"rape advocates\".\n\n\nTheir view was, \"we need to be supporting of the survivor\". Their view was, \"We can't victimize her again by forcing her to answer questions.\" Their view was, \"Do whatever she wants, and she didn't want to call the police.\"\n\n\nThis is the WHOLE friggen problem with these \"rape advocates\".\n\n\nAnd the issue is VERY real, because these people are basically trying to overturn the rule of law and put in place a bunch of \"just trust the claim maker and bring down the hammer\" policies all over the country.\n\n\nThese people have no skepticism, they have no concept of evidence, they have no concept of investigation. Their entire view is, \"If a girl makes a rape allegation it's fact, and believe it all, girl's don't lie!\"\n\n\nMind you, this is the SECOND high profile rape allegation about a college frat in recent year that is turning out to be bogus.\n\n\nThese people want this type of baseless non-investigative process to be implemented at every university in America to start throwing out male students left and right, without serious questioning of the alleged victim, without serious consideration of evidence, etc. They \"feel\" that all of that just \"re-victimizes\" women. \n\n\nThey want to turn our legal system back to the days of witch hunts.\n\n\nThis insanity,and once again these \"rape advocates\" have just proven the point of all of their opponents, which is unfortunate for real rape victims.\n\n\nQuite honestly, the problem starts in the sociology departments, and I say that as an advocate of sociology, but really the field has been turned into a farce by anti-science, anti-evidence people who just use it to advocate for their causes and who quite frankly fear facts and evidence (which is unfortunately because the facts and evidence are often on their side if they could figure out how to understand them).\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOK:  Got it now...

The idea that state exchanges were a necessary pre-condition for subsidy is not only plainly written in the law, it was done so by intent. Our good friend Mr. Gruber noted this publicly many times.\n\nIf Congress didn't collectively understand the law up front, tough. That was our good friend Mrs. Pelosi saying we'd need to pass it to see what was in it. Now we have.\n\nSo if it collapses of its own internal contradictions, what could be more just?\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nIt's disturbing to think a sociopath got up extra early to write that drivel. Really, if expanding health care to the working poor is that awful, why not declare Jesus an enemy combatant and torture him at Gitmo. You clowns are breathtakingly evil.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThat's about it...  It's the same strategy the GOP / ultra-conservatives have used effective for years now.

The real problem is that our nation appears to have so many people stupid enough to fall for such a ploy.  Things may not bode well for our nation unless the dumbing down is somehow cured.

After his accident his IQ dropped he turned to alcohol and got divorced. Things got worse and in 1996 24 years after his accident he ended up in an argument with an ex girl friend and wound up shooting a cop. The question is whether Clayton should be executed because he is mentally impaired. Judging from many of the thoughts I hear nowadays Clayton would have already been mentally impaired prior to his accident. And since he shot a cop many may argue did the accident make him better. Under what I may, excuse me, define as normal circumstances Mr. Clayton is a human tragedy whose life already appears to have been an execution.

I share your opinion of Clinton, but for one thing:  I don't think Sanders is truly electable; the right wing calls of \"socialist\" or \"commie\" will be so loud and vociferous that no sane voice will be able to get a word in edgewise.  Which leaves Clinton and all the participants of the chartered GOP clown bus... with up to 4 seats on the SCOTUS potentially coming open for nomination.  There's not a republican on the planet I would want to have that opportunity... the very future of the republic depends on that, IMO... So?  OK Hillary...

In the past 5 - 10 years, there have been small, organic, sustainable farms that have begun producing pork, poultry, and beef in ways that while more expensive, aren't destroying the environment the way the large ag producers have been doing for decades.  This farm is actually known as a newer, sustainable, (and dare I say) responsible producer of these products.  Before you accuse them of being another Tyson Chicken or Smithfield Pork  (now owned by Chinese interests)?  You might want to do more than peruse a Facebook page and assume you know what you are reading.  Try Googling \"NC hog waste lagoons\" to see the difference.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Take a good hard look around you, what is the main stream media really telling us.? If it weren't for so many people with phones that can record this stuff do you really think any of these shootings would make the nightly news cast..? Our black community happens to be much better at getting the details than the white community.. They also take it more seriously and personally.. Take a hard look at the biker assassinations out of Waco Tx. Most of those people are veterans.. The narrative provided by the Waco PD is false, as in a lie. Check out the incident in Potecello UT at a POW/MIA remembrance rally a few weeks ago, another veteran assembly.. Not all bikers are white nor are they male.. All Americans, black, white, red, yellow, brown yes All Americans are under attack.. The old white women standing on bridges don't amass in large numbers because it's not safe, not because the numbers are limited, they are targets of many including police.. The militarization and high rate of deaths at the hand of our local law enforcement is a serious problem for all of us.. Keep in mind with the high numbers of the current unidentified foreign populace a LEO has no idea what they are walking into when they approach you and every PD has at least one paranoid insecure officer on the job.. Most more than one.. When the fed provides military equipment to local PD's what line of verbal BS is provided with this equipment.? What has emboldened them to shoot first and think about it later..?\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nTrivial point perhaps...

(I think.)  The problem?  Isn't that I'm being too literal; it's that so many others that swarm comment forums anytime this particular subject comes up actually <b>ARE</b> being exactly that literal.  I've been there before, by the way.  Wrote some letters to the editor of my local paper on this very subject, that included my name and the name of my town.  Within hours of publication I was receiving threatening phone calls in the middle of the night and within days had anonymous mail with death threats to me and my family in my mailbox.\n\nSo?  I'm not all that certain what will change it, beyond our elected representatives actually representing us when the morality police (see Ted Crus, et. al.) begins thumping their chests.  But I'm not really interested in seeing the next Scott Roeder turn up in my driveway.  One reason why I will NEVER participate in discussions like this ever again with my real name attached.  And since I have an ethical issue with lying and making up a false Facebook identity, that pretty much leaves me out of the discussion on many websites that have bailed and outsourced their forums to Zuckerburg...\n\nBut short answer that I turned long here?  I'm not sure that any \"discussion\" with fanatics is possible anymore.  I think now it's simply pointing us to the need to be vigilant in terms of legal points.  And that's why, even though I'm not all that much a Hillary Clinton supporter, if it comes down to her or ANY of the current GOP candidates?  Knowing that the next POTUS could possibly end up nominating 3 or 4 new justices to the SCOTUS?  Yeah, I'll vote for her - or Sanders - in a heartbeat, other than do anything to give such fanaticism any more room to breathe on legal issues like this.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And yes, Megyn Kelly did her \"eyelash\" thing with leading questions to Trump more that with others.  But good Lord, here's this guy talking about how tough, rich, important he is and he's whining on and on on Twitter into the middle of the night?  Either he's the unhinged narcissist many think he is or his skin is thinner than any other GOP candidate... either way?  Why he still polls in the 20% numbers simply frightens me as a reflection of the relative intelligence of the GOP base...

So you've typically got 9 offensive and defensive linemen on each play, +/-1, out of 22 players on the field.

There is a different approach. Our plight will never end while we accept the consumerism that we have been taught. Every 6 minutes while watching TV we are prompted to consume.\u00a0 If in your dialog the words \"Let's go Shopping\" is used as a recreational device you have been trained to consume.\u00a0 How many pairs of shoes do you own? Why do so many think that 40 or more pairs does not denote a problem.\n\nWe see on TV the show Horders. These poor souls have had their \"nesting\" circuit overloaded. We are played by our owners as they use this natural instinct to push their wares.\u00a0 Until the idea of recreational or mood modifying shopping is seen as turning over our hard earned resources to our masters, we can pretend that there will be a way to reverse the problem. But, as long as \"Shopping\" is a recreational activity we will never begin to get control of our lives or the direction of our civilization.\n\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\n<i>\"\u2014By Andy Kroll | March/April 2012 Issue\"</i>\n\n\nI'll join the others asking the obvious; what is a 4-year-old article doing getting recycled?

But if I didn't have that?  I simply wouldn't shoot anymore.  The ranges around our home have become snake pits of preppers, Trump supporters, tea party types and frankly all of them are pretty frightening people. And the fact that the proprietors of some of them are about as extreme as some of the patrons simply makes them a place to avoid.  There may well be some ranges that don't fit this stereotype, but those sure as heck aren't anywhere near where we live.
