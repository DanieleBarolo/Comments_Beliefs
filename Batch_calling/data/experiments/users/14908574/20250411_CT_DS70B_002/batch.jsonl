His grades have been hidden, so this is a specious argument. Snowden saw behavior that he thought was wrong and he brought it to our attention. That's all he ever said he was doing. And I for one am glad he did, because it does look to me that the federal government no longer takes the Constitution as the law of the land. In fact, it appears that our government is lawless and is treating us all as targets. So it's time to impeach Obama and throw these generals in jail. The NSA itself should be defunded and all of its employees terminated. They have not demonstrated that they are needed for anything other than serving as the espionage arm of big companies.\n\nBTW, an ex-NSA-director said something similar back in 2006 after these charges about NSA were first revealed.

YEAH. He took a job where he not only violated the rules of his workplace, he got others to do so as well (by getting them to give him their passwords so he could access additional data).\n\nI'll repeat that as the additional information about the NSA's activities has leaked out my attitudes around Snowden have changed, and mainly for the positive, but that's partly because they started off so negative. The original \"shocking revelations\" about the metadata gathering activities were all known to me (at least in the broad) and Snowden seemed like a grandstander (that he was aligned with one-note pony Glenn Greenwald didn't help). But the drip-drip-drip has shown the programs are more extensive than (I would guess) anyone realized, and bringing this to light has done a real public service. That DOES NOT make Snowden a \"Whistle Blower\" (in the legal sense of the term) but probably makes him the equivalent of a \"whistle blower\" in the functional sense. \n\nOver and above the good which has come out of Snowden's revelations (and yes, on balance I think this has been a Good Thing\u2122) there would almost certainly be real social value in Snowden coming back, facing charges, and making his case to the public. Unfortunately, his situation is complicated enough that the outcome would be far from certain, so it's unlikely this will happen and Snowden will remain a powerful Rohrschach test for peoples' complex attitudes about the trade-off between security and privacy.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nYes. And in the process doing more than you or I or 10,000 protesters will ever do to protect the individual freedom and democracy of the citizens of the united states, and the hundreds of millions of people in allied nations.  Or would you rather we all slide into having our own versions of the Stasi monitoring us?\n\nSnowden is a hero.  Most of the time, such people are a-holes on close examination.

Over 85,000 calls and 180,000 emails\u2014as well as over 200,000 international signatures\u2014is remarkable. And companies did in fact get involved: Google sent an email to over 3 million people to get them to take action in addition to writing a blog post; Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and Reddit posted, not to mention pushed the Reform Government Surveillance action that converted to thousands taking action; Mozilla changed the startpage on millions of people's browsers\u2014the list (Tumblr, DuckDuckGo, Namecheap, etc.) goes on.\n\nThe SOPA fight was a long, long fight. The blackout day wasn't the only event\u2014there were major days of action for months leading up to it, including American Censorship Day (http://americancensorship.org/). We didn't call for a blackout, so why would websites black their homepages out or go offline? Comparing what happened yesterday with single biggest online activist moment ever is absurd. \n\nYesterday, we made an impact, and we laid the foundation for an escalating campaign. From a specific perspective, it was a Senate-facing act, and I'd ask any Senate office if they've received such volume of calls recently. The \"we\" in the Day We Fight Back *was* huge, the crowd speaking out is only getting bigger, and we definitely accomplished our goals.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nThe numbers are actually small, which probably reflects the NSA's ability to tap the optic cables and take everything.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022China\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Diversity\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

He would send one of his messenger boys to a Senator and say that his name (or his wife's name, or child's name) had come up in an investigation of homosexuality (or communism, or financial improprieties) and the director just wanted him to know. Now that would work fairly well to get Senatorial votes on FBI funding, but to turn Obama into a puppet, they would need to sit down with him as you suggest, and lay it out: that he could play at being president, but he wold have to defer to the real powers on policy matters.

There is just no way I am going to believe we have that many terrorists who lead ordinary lives and car pool their kids from school to soccer fields and need spying. The issue they are trying to raise about the Russian involvement I feel is only a distraction from the fact that our government has overstepped their duties. \n\n\nAnd at this point, I don't care what the Russians may have offered Snowden (I see no evidence they did much other than let him stay).

I also said that once we didn't have the Cold War, our government would turn their spying skills on the US citizens.

Every time I read something that some crazy person has claimed, I think it can't get worse than this.....and so far, I have been wrong every time.\n\n\nOne important thing we should remember is, that even IF the Russians had any part in what Snowden released, there would have been no story at all, had members of our government not violated our rights by spying on us with no probable cause. There is just no way I am going to believe we have that many terrorists who lead ordinary lives and car pool their kids from school to soccer fields and need spying. The issue they are trying to raise about the Russian involvement I feel is only a distraction from the fact that our government has overstepped their duties. \n\n\nAnd at this point, I don't care what the Russians may have offered Snowden (I see no evidence they did much other than let him stay). I think we need to do something about the 'enemy within\".\n\n\nI argued with military friends in 1980 that the Russians were going to rot from within, from corruption and poverty. I also said that once we didn't have the Cold War, our government would turn their spying skills on the US citizens. I was called 'radical' by some of those old friends, but this is what happened.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOne wouldn't expect Obama to be so much like a  Cheney neocon that Bill Kristol--a Cheney admirer--congratulated him on becoming a \"born-again neocon\" by his second year in office.

E&W Germany were a huge problem for many years and almost brought us to war with the Soviets. Korea was divided \"temporarily\" at Yalta by FDR and Stalin and has been a huge problem ever since. The \"temporary\" division of Vietnam by the big powers in 1954 was equally bad. When the south refused to hold the required elections, war was inevitable. Our experiment with colonialism and empire building has been a disaster since WW2. Britain was good at it.
