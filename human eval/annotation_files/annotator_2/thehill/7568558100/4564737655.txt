Obama and Holder launched the war on the cops based on the Ferguson "hands up, don't shoot" meme which was proven to be a complete and total lie. There's that.

For all the democrats attacking and blaming Trump. Please type out in detail  everything Obama did in his 8 long years in office to stop gun violence. And let us not forget Sandy Hook happened on Obama's watch. What did he do to curtail gun violence after that again?
