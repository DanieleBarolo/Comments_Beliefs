Being "pro-vaccine" is being unbiased. Just as writing from the assumption that gravity draws objects of mass to the earth is not "gravity biased ". Vaccines work and have been proven to be safe. That's science not politics and not opinion. Anti-vaxxers are the climate change deniers of the left.

It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

PARENT COMMENT:
The piece of journalism seems to be pro-vaccine and not unbiased. However I could be biased. I do not vaccinate my children for many reason. I sign a exemption for ethical reasons because mercury and formaldehyde are poisons. That is just two of the many toxic ingredients in vaccines. So it is ridiculous and extremely dangerous to put highly dangerous chemicals and  heavy metals in infants, children's, and adults bodies. It is beyond me that there is anyone who still buys this insanity. The question is why are there so many childhood diseases now compared to before the ramped up vaccine schedule? How come pharmaceutical companies are protected from getting into legal trouble for vaccine injury. That is criminal. My children never get ill, we are perfectly healthy because we protect and boost our immune systems, and we avoid all poisons that we can. All states should make it easy for parents to avoid putting toxic poisons in their children's bodies.
