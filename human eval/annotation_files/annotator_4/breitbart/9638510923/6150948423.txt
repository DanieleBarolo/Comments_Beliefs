PARENT COMMENT:
You might just as well ask Trump to change his DNA and become a platypus. He's not doing this for America. At this point, he seeks the presidency as much to evade future prosecution as to line his (and his family's) pockets.

DeSantis has a real shot against Biden.  Trump is a loser, has done nothing but lose for his party time and again, and would almost certainly lose again in 2024.   Not that he or his minion millions would ever concede the fact.

  They don't get more stupid than Bragg. The so called charges are fake. This is a banana republic political  tactic. We are officially a banana republic.

    Someone on here already said "we are officially a banana republic" at least ten years ago on Breitbart.

      LOL Dumbo Disney DeSantis made a Tweet today.....That he will not 
assist in any Extradition from Florida.... Not mentioning Trump by name...now WHY WOULD THAT BE?

Now this is what Kari Lake Wrote...“You want to beat President Donald Trump? Get more votes than him in November 2024… 
<b>I unequivocally stand beside President Donald J. Trump and in defense of the rule of law,” said Lake.</b>

See the difference? 


While at the same time today....The florida senate scheduled the Resign to 
Run law (so Desantis can run as being governor) for early next week.
DeSantis is now trying to rebrand himself - It has Karl Rove Written all over it......

Also...Russian Collusion Hoax has already set the precedent for ANYTHING GOES.
<i><b>The guilty do not get prosecuted while the innocent get persecuted....</b></i>
Make prisoners of your political opponents. It clears your field.
Welcome to the jungle. The next Democrat who calls Putin a thug, needs to look in the mirror and see Stalin smiling back..

Someone wanted that Trans shooter outta of headlines..

        Karl Rove is an insider.  DeSantis is not.

          Ron DeSantis was a U.S. Congressman, and then a Republican Governor. Karl Rove has never been elected to anything...ever. How is Ron DeSantis not an insider?

            By your logic Trump being a former President is an Insider then....

Let us not be obtuse, that is a demonrat game.  Karl Rove is the architect of the GOP section of the Deep State and everyone knows this.

They hate Desantis as much as they hate Trump!

              The Republicans are taking this hook, line, and sinker...  Trump wants this to backfire in order for the base to rally...  The Democrats are planning on this backfiring so that Trump becomes the Republican nominee...  The toxicity of Trump will stop Independents and Moderate Democrats for voting Republican... the Democrats will win again because of the Republican blind loyalty to a narcissist that truly loves himself more than the country.  What is the greatest proof of love for another?   Self sacrifice.  If Trump truly loved the country more than himself he would draw fire from the Democrats, drive them crazy, let them continue to go full Stazi and show their hand (as if they haven't done enough already), and then right at the time of the Republican primary he would step aside, ask his base to fully support Desantis, and then keep his f'n mouth shut.  But that is not Trump.
