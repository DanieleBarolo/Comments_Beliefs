There is video proof of her calling segregationist Robert \"KKK\" Byrd her mentor. There is video proof of the KKK admitting to giving her 25k and endorsing her. Her husband rapist Bill's mentor was segregationist J. William Fulbright. Bill's VP was Al Gore Jr, the son of segregationist Al Gore Sr. Byrd, Fulbright and Gore Sr. were against the Civil Rights Act and Byrd tried to filibuster it.

May we use  them wisely.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You have changed your tune 180 degree's from your campaign promises, you DO NOT need a deal, we have all the laws right now to deport just keep doing that, don't legalize a few million future Democrats, I know you love your daughter Ivanka but seriously your love of her advice will make you turn your back on the MAIN thing that got you elected?\n\nThis BullShit has to end, and it ends by draining the Swamp you have surrounded yourself with Mr. President, you have more Swamp snakes around you than can be found in a Louisiana Bayou.\n\nYou sign any Bill that has DACA amnesty and no end to chain migration, no FULL funding for the wall, does not end lottery visa's, does not end chain Migration and you will go down in History one step below Obama.\n\n\ud83d\udc00\nTrump made promises to you, I and the Angel moms that means there can be NO deal.

So, If you were on a respirator and given the drug and died vrs someone taking it at the early stages of the virus, the outcome could be different.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhy?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They have thoroughly insinuated themselves into American government, corporations and academia. They themselves are experiencing economic and political difficulties, which like a cornered animal, makes them even more dangerous and likely to lash out.\n\nSo they severely compromised Dementia Joe before he ever became BOGUS POTUS. Then they DELIBERATELY unleashed pandemic, notably, in an existentially critical election year, their China Virus was practically Dementia Joe's true running mate. They mass murdered Americans! Have no doubt they are also somewhat behind the antifa/blm Democrat shock troops who are on an unrelenting mission to collapse American society. Don't believe me.

Moreover, Islam, its Totalitarian Hate Teachings(eg. Quran, Hadith, Sira, Tafsir, etc.), its Terrorist-Training Mosques, its Slaveholder Shariah/Foreign Law(Islamic Law),  its Subversive Political Organizations(eg. CAIR, ISIS, MSA, OIC, etc.), its Sinister Halal Certifications, its Diabolical Prostitution Practices, its Polygamist / Child-Marriage Practices, its Racist Gender-Segregated Schools, its Detestable Pagan Holidays, its Socialist Economic System, and its Genocidal Caliphate(eg.  Islamic Empire / State / Ummah) are a legal threat and a terroristic menace to every Country and Constitution in the world because Islam produces Polygamous, Subversive, Discriminatory, Malicious, Racist, Seditious, and Tyrannical Criminal Enterprises against ALL Non-Muslims(Quran 2:178, 244; 3:54, 85,110; 4:65,95; 5:55; 8:30, 39, 74; 9:5, 29, 33, 41, 73, 88, 111, 123).  Islam\u2019s true ambition is to build Islam\u2019s Caliphate or Islamic State over all the world using lies and deceit(Quran 8:39; 9:33).  Islam means \u201cto surrender\u201d by becoming a Muslim(Quran 48:16; 49:14-15). By failing to become a Muslim under Islam\u2019s Law(eg. convert to Islam or die), the Christian or J * wish Non-Muslim is a CRIMINAL who must pay Jizya(Extortion Penalty) to stay alive while the other Non-Muslims are not offered this payment option and are annihilated(Quran 9:5,29). Qur\u2019an 9:29 says, \u201cEngage in war with those who do not believe in Allah nor in the last day. Nor forbid what Allah and his messenger forbid, nor believe in the religion of the truth[Islam] among those who have been given the book[Christians and J * w s] until they pay the jizya[extortion penalty] out of hand and they are subdued[disgraced].\u201d\n\nIslam is a racist worldview, a segregationist Autocratic ideology, a treacherous movement, and a discriminatory government(Caliphate, Islamic State) of lies, terrorism, fear, intimidation, and deceit(Quran 3:54; 5:51; 7:99; 8:30; 13:42), and every Muslim, peaceful and violent, is a terrorist according to Allah(Quran 49:14-15).  All 50+ Islamic Countries(eg. Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc.) are State-Sponsors of terrorism and discrimination. Islam and Muslims are the main source, cause, and threat of terrorism and discrimination in the world(Quran 4:74-76; 9:29).  Thus, the corrupt cult of Islam should NOT have religious protections under the law in any country, and Islam and its Mosques should be banned because coexistence with Islam is never possible with Islam\u2019s discriminatory and terroristic ideology(Quran 5:51; 9:29; 98:6-7).  Quran 98:6-7 says, \u201c6 Surely those who became infidels, from the People of the Book[J * w s and Christians] and polytheists, will abide in the fire of hell forever. Those are the worst of the creatures. 7 Surely those who believed and did good deeds, those are the best of the creatures.\u201d  How do Muslims bring the Non-Muslims to Islam?

The church tax keeps them all afloat. They keep pandering to the liberals and they still leave. The German bishops are a disaster and are heading for schism. As they become more Protestant they suffer the same fate. Faithful German Catholics have to suffer a great deal from their own bishops. The weeds and the wheat will grow together, but we know the fate of the weeds.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nEverywhere the neo-Catholic, non-traditional views of Bergoglio and his henchmen  are being propagated, the Catholic Church loses members and income. Where the Traditional Latin Mass is still said, however, these churches are growing and expanding, creating new schools and new religious orders. Catholics still love the church, but Bergoglio is destroying it as fast as he can. Satan is truly in the heart of the church. Bergoglio has repressed the TLM in the most vicious way possible, but there is a resistance movement which signals hope.
