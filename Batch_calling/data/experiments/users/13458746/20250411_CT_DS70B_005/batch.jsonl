Let's see... I'll try to list out what I would do to reform the education system, a lot of this is based on the japanese system. some of it is not. The education sytsem was on decline long before no child left behind, however it definitely screwed it up further. It stemmed from the idea that everyone had to be treated equally when it's obvious that people think and learn in very different ways.\n\n1) Allow vouchers. It will allow competition which should reduce costs and raise school quality. It has nothing to do with the amount of income a school gets, we can see this by looking at the lack of correlation between increased funds and grades.\n\n2) Modify tenure so that if a teacher is sitting on his/her ass not actually teaching they can be fired no matter what\n\n3) Mandated education ends at 16 (Junior High). After that entrance exams will help you get into specific senior high schools. If you choose to. Alternative trade schools, etc should also be opened up.\n\n4) And this one is also gonna piss off a lot of people. Get rid of the massive summer vacation. It was created because on average students lived on family farms so they needed to be off during the summer months.\n\n4a) Convert the current school system to a trimester system with smaller breaks and a shorter summer vacation in the middle of the school year so that work can be assigned over it. This will prevent the issue of having to re-teach/relearn all the material that has for far too long been forgotten over long summer vacations.\n\n5) This one is going to be the absolute most difficult one. We need to get families involved once again in the education process. There are so many parents who don't give a damn about what kind of education their child gets. Partially because the parent has no choice. The voucher system as well as the senior high setup should help with that a bit but... it's gonna take time and effort.\n\n*thinks* I'm sure there's more but \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I can teach my children about the scientific process early on. About questioning everything they see before them and how to use the process involved in creating and testing scientific theories as a part of general life As well as how to use logic to solve problems and how to always work through a problem no matter how difficult the challenge seems.\n\nI would teach them language and music introducing them to living and dead languagtes and music spanning the centuries. And how important they are since they help shape our society as much as society helps shape them. I would teach them yoga and tai chi as ways of staying fit both physically and mentally. Along with the more common sports children are used to playing. \n\nI can also teach them the importance of hard work and personal responsibility. How they use what I teach them in life I unfortunately have no control over. No more than any other parent has control over the path their children take in the end. All you can do is your best.\n\nAs for religion you seem to not be able to read well or at least not process information well otherwise you'd know that I am not religious in any way.

However I try to learn more each day especially if I am going to comment specifically on a topic. Which is why I have been studying the supreme court justices since the first post today. It's still difficult to find a good site that lists recent supreme court decisions.\n\nAnd yes you are supposed to take me seriously since nobody has a 100% understanding of every specturm of politics.

I am in full support of a safety net that protects people in emergency situations if it is a type of safety net that promotes getting back on your feet instead of staying on welfare. Unfortunately the welfare system we have has no guidelines for requiring a welfare recipient to be actively looking for a job and so we end up with what I call the underclass \"families\" of single parents who have multiple children out of wedlock often with multiple partners that never had the means of supporting themselves let alone a family and who do not focus on teaching their children the value of hard work and so the children just see welfare as a way of life.\n\nReally? I'm sorry, almost no politician on either side of the isle votes because it's the right thing to do. They vote as a political motive.

It is not so much the debt that I have an issue with. Since historically we have been around 19% for the last few years. It's the recent rise in spending to GDP and more importantly the fact that we are borrowing money from ourselves, China, and other creditors in order to pay the interest on that debt.\n\nFamily or government that is unsustainable. If it continues the result would most likely be that the government will have to print more money to buy up more of the debt which will devalue the dollar, possibly leading to hyper inflation if it gets out of hand.

Way to go, Government. Glad you're 'for the poeple'. YOU SUCK!!!\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nI often hear the expense argument: that antibiotic and hormone-free meat is a yuppie luxury. But the low prices that we have for meat are artificially so. They are the result of severe overcrowding, which necessitates the routine use of antibiotics -- a HUGE problem. What does it tell us that beef importation is banned in Europe? The European Union simply does not allow the ridiculous, unscrupulous, and irresponsible (on so many levels) farming methods that are now the norm in the U.S. I am a meat-eater. I am also on a budget. What I find is a better solution than buying crappy meat and eating a ton of it (Americans eat far more meat than we need or is healthy), I simply buy quality meat, stock up when it's on sale and freeze in usable portions, eat less of it, and eat more beans and whole grains to complement the protein from the meat. There are other solutions. Many of us just don't want to find them, as it's slightly inconvenient. We've gotten used to such an unhealthy lifestyle and it's killing us en-masse. What is more expensive in the long run?\u00a0\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nWhile being a vegetarian or vegan has its benefits, it is very easy to fall into the trap of not getting the proper nutrients. I've noticed a lot of people who switch over have to eat more and so tend to gain weight too. Also it doesn't matter veggies or meat, massive improper farming techniques causes just as much destruction when they're growing veggies. Devestation of natural lands, etc. Also don't forget all the pesticides, etc.\n\nThe best idea is going local, not organic. Unfortunately USDA has put so many restrictions, especially cost wise, on organic farming that only the mega farms can afford to be labled organic. People don't need to worry about the organic lable as long as they know the source is a good source and that's why local works.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Republicans will hold that legislation hostage and demand that he extend the Bush tax cuts as a bargain. The media will ratchet up talk about how this is a do or die moment for Obama, how his reelection is in peril, how his legacy depends on it. David Ploufe will get very nervous. \u00a0In the meantime, the very important legislation will get twisted to resemble Republican policy preferences. In the end, Obama will sign what an essentially Republican bill with a tax cut extension to boot, then pat himself on the back for his ability to compromise. Paul Krugman will write a column.\u00a0\n\nIf Obama is reelected, expect to see this repeated for the next five years.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI suppose it's not that the TSA is a problem but the way they are going about things is.

Stop foaming at the mouth.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I would venture that many in the Tea Party proper and\nthose attending their rallies are working class* people who are the actual\ntargets of those behind the funding and literature that propels the Tea Party.\n   I venture to say that most Tea Party-ers are patriotic and \"god fearing\"\nindividuals. But, it is those very qualities that make them an easy mark for\nmanipulation. If you convince people that their allies are their enemies you\ncan manipulate your enemies into actually eliminating themselves.\n   There is no law against lying and deceiving in the name of politics in this country so we must\nalways be vigilant against legal sedition and treason. That means educating\nourselves and seeking knowledge outside of the political arena. Those are the\npitfalls of a republic.\n\n(*working class, Labor etc.: anyone who works for a living, receives a paycheck, pays\nfederal withholding tax and or small business owners.) Get used to it, there is\nno middle class, politically speaking. That is an arbitrary dividing line\ncreated for manipulative purposes.

I never placed blame solely on the education system. I believe only a full effort to repair both the education system and our family/community is going to work. Education needs to start at home with family. It just makes sense. That's why I believe in an education system that highly incorporates parents. For example, in Finland, early education in public daycare programs are set up for each child using a coordinated effort between both parents and educators.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You must believe that the tea party thinks that religion makes no sense and while there are a lot of nice stories in the bible, that's all the bible, torah, qu'ran, etc are; a collection of stories.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Yes, so bush and the republicans are indeed irresponsible and spent far more than they should have while . However given that congress which is in control of spending for the most part was under demorat control from 2006 - 2010, blame can not be put souly on the republicans either.\n\nAs I have mentioned both the democrats and republicans are big spenders. They are also both control freaks.

We can start by ending the wars in Iraq, Afganastan, Libya, and the war on drugs. We can remove all military bases stationed in low risk areas of the world. Then with the money left we focus at national defense, maybe rebuild NASA.\n\nUnfortunately we can't be the sleeping giant anymore. Most of the time we were considered that, there wasn't a centralized movement opposed to the west. Most of the major imperialism had ended, we were partially inbetween crusade/jihad periods. So it was pretty easy being pure isolationists. So sadly the most we can do is roll back a lot of the unnecessary spending and create a more focused effort at defense.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

As I said they made some mistakes in the past, and because of the combined financial burdon of those mistakes and what I consider very high taxes for the amount the government is doing, can not afford to make required repairs on their house. Their house is literally unsafe to live in, and they have no choice but to continue to live there.\n\nAlso I brought this up partially to mention that the Bush tax cuts effected everyone, not just the evil rich. In fact, the effective tax rate for the lowest quintile was cut in half thanks to the bush tax cuts while the effective tax rate for the top quintile changed only slightly.\n\nI am not opposed to tax hikes, however forcing people to pay premium prices for a sub par product is completely unreasonable. Our government is broken. Each year it spends more and more and yet it does less and less. By comparison the government programs in many other countries, per dollar they are far more effective. When we no longer have a junk government to pay for, then I will not be opposed to raising taxes. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

One precedes our founding fathers and finds its roots in the harshness of our puritan past. It is very suspicious of freedom, uncomfortable with diversity, hostile to science, unfriendly to reason, contemptuous of personal autonomy. It sees America as a religious nation. It views patriotism as allegiance to God. It secretly adores coercion and conformity. Despite our constitution, despite the legacy of the Enlightenment, it appeals to millions of Americans and threatens our freedom.\nThe other vision finds its roots in the spirit of our founding revolution and in the leaders of this nation who embraced the age of reason. It loves freedom, encourages diversity, embraces science and affirms the dignity and rights of every individual. It sees America as a moral nation, neither completely religious nor completely secular. It defines patriotism as love of country and of the people who make it strong.

In other words, I fix what the teachers broke. Not to say that there aren't good teachers out there. It's a shame that we have such a negative outlook on teachers in america (those that can't, teach).\n\nWe are nothing like somalia. We have a national board of education that dictates guildlines constantly to all the states in this country. There is very little autonomy at the state level, let alone at the local level and even more importantly at the level of the individual teacher. Only a system where teachers are allowed a great deal of freedom, while also being held to high standards themselves, will we see our education system recover.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

There is\u00a0actually\u00a0a 4th mode of production that isn't even widely considered, which is neighborhood based farming. Now I know this concept sounds a bit absurd, and like a throw back to the dark ages, but listen for a moment.\n\nWhat our industrial \u00a0production systems do in general is they exchange\u00a0inefficient\u00a0use of labor for\u00a0inefficient\u00a0use of raw materials. Things get cheaper because less labor is used to produce them, but in fact we use more raw materials in the production\u00a0process\u00a0so we\u00a0actually\u00a0waste more material, but the cost of the excess material itself goes down due to the same process of reducing labor costs for acquisition of the raw materials.\n\nNow this is most acute when applied to food production, and within food production it is most acute when applied to animal food production.\n\nThe REAL value of animals as a food source is that animals can convert\u00a0material inedible to humans into an edible form, in other words goats can forage on weeds and grass and trash, things we can't eat, and turn it into meat, something we can eat.\n\nIn a more primitive sense, buffalo and deer can forage on grass and trees and turn it into meat, etc.\n\nSo this works\u00a0efficiently\u00a0when animals are\u00a0turning\u00a0things we can't eat into stuff we can eat. But that's not how we raise\u00a0livestock\u00a0now, now we grow human edible food and then feed it to\u00a0animals,\u00a0which\u00a0defeats the whole purpose of even eating animals.\n\n\u00a0So, aside from proscribing\u00a0vegetarianism, if animals are indeed to be grown and harvested for food we should be using them only to consume things that we can't eat and turn it into edible meat, converting \"waste\" into something useful.\n\nNow, we also have a MASSIVE problem of food waste in America, and this stems from waste of foods and home and in\u00a0restaurants. What happens\u00a0with\u00a0this food is that it gets thrown into the trash and goes to land fills, where sea gulls and vulchers eat a portion of it and he rest rots in the ground getting eaten by microbes and bugs.\n\nWhat we should be doing is community based pig, goat, and chicken farming and feeding the animals the waste from our homes and\u00a0restaurants, thus\u00a0converting\u00a0waste into something useful, solving two problems at once.\n\nBut we don't do this for two primary reasons. #1 is zoning. With the rise of urbanization and modernization having farm animals among the people was undesirable by the citizens who appealed to legislators to make it illegal to raise farm\u00a0animals\u00a0in residential areas, and also it was seen as\u00a0primitive\u00a0and backwards to have farm animals in cosmopolitan areas so city leaders, etc didn't want that. Plus there is the real issue of public health and animals were seen and spreaders of disease, which is\u00a0partly\u00a0true. So that's the firs tissue, zoning.\n\nIssue #2 is labor and scale, again going back to the first point of trading efficient use of material for efficient use of labor. While it uses less raw material, or makes better use of raw material, to do community based farming and use community waste as the food source, you can't get the scale or the\u00a0efficiency\u00a0in terms\u00a0of\u00a0labor, so it\u00a0becomes\u00a0more cost effective to\u00a0just buy farmed corn than to try and collect waste and process it and distribute it among smaller and distributed facilities, etc.\n\nBut, ultimately, this is where we need to go. We need to work on reversing the\u00a0zoning\u00a0restrictions against farming in residential areas and we need to move to a \"food waste to farm\" system where the recycle our food waste back into the food chain, as was\u00a0traditionally\u00a0done for thousands\u00a0of\u00a0years (because it was a more efficient use of raw material, and thus also labor in an non\u00a0industrialized\u00a0system)\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI do like neighborhood based farming.

There is\u00a0actually\u00a0a 4th mode of production that isn't even widely considered, which is neighborhood based farming. Now I know this concept sounds a bit absurd, and like a throw back to the dark ages, but listen for a moment.\n\nWhat our industrial \u00a0production systems do in general is they exchange\u00a0inefficient\u00a0use of labor for\u00a0inefficient\u00a0use of raw materials. Things get cheaper because less labor is used to produce them, but in fact we use more raw materials in the production\u00a0process\u00a0so we\u00a0actually\u00a0waste more material, but the cost of the excess material itself goes down due to the same process of reducing labor costs for acquisition of the raw materials.\n\nNow this is most acute when applied to food production, and within food production it is most acute when applied to animal food production.\n\nThe REAL value of animals as a food source is that animals can convert\u00a0material inedible to humans into an edible form, in other words goats can forage on weeds and grass and trash, things we can't eat, and turn it into meat, something we can eat.\n\nIn a more primitive sense, buffalo and deer can forage on grass and trees and turn it into meat, etc.\n\nSo this works\u00a0efficiently\u00a0when animals are\u00a0turning\u00a0things we can't eat into stuff we can eat. But that's not how we raise\u00a0livestock\u00a0now, now we grow human edible food and then feed it to\u00a0animals,\u00a0which\u00a0defeats the whole purpose of even eating animals.\n\n\u00a0So, aside from proscribing\u00a0vegetarianism, if animals are indeed to be grown and harvested for food we should be using them only to consume things that we can't eat and turn it into edible meat, converting \"waste\" into something useful.\n\nNow, we also have a MASSIVE problem of food waste in America, and this stems from waste of foods and home and in\u00a0restaurants. What happens\u00a0with\u00a0this food is that it gets thrown into the trash and goes to land fills, where sea gulls and vulchers eat a portion of it and he rest rots in the ground getting eaten by microbes and bugs.\n\nWhat we should be doing is community based pig, goat, and chicken farming and feeding the animals the waste from our homes and\u00a0restaurants, thus\u00a0converting\u00a0waste into something useful, solving two problems at once.\n\nBut we don't do this for two primary reasons. #1 is zoning. With the rise of urbanization and modernization having farm animals among the people was undesirable by the citizens who appealed to legislators to make it illegal to raise farm\u00a0animals\u00a0in residential areas, and also it was seen as\u00a0primitive\u00a0and backwards to have farm animals in cosmopolitan areas so city leaders, etc didn't want that. Plus there is the real issue of public health and animals were seen and spreaders of disease, which is\u00a0partly\u00a0true. So that's the firs tissue, zoning.\n\nIssue #2 is labor and scale, again going back to the first point of trading efficient use of material for efficient use of labor. While it uses less raw material, or makes better use of raw material, to do community based farming and use community waste as the food source, you can't get the scale or the\u00a0efficiency\u00a0in terms\u00a0of\u00a0labor, so it\u00a0becomes\u00a0more cost effective to\u00a0just buy farmed corn than to try and collect waste and process it and distribute it among smaller and distributed facilities, etc.\n\nBut, ultimately, this is where we need to go. We need to work on reversing the\u00a0zoning\u00a0restrictions against farming in residential areas and we need to move to a \"food waste to farm\" system where the recycle our food waste back into the food chain, as was\u00a0traditionally\u00a0done for thousands\u00a0of\u00a0years (because it was a more efficient use of raw material, and thus also labor in an non\u00a0industrialized\u00a0system)\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLargest institutions means less people to corrupt.

They are both using their money to push political agendas.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If you remember, under almost all of the clinton administration you had a major effect from the dot com bubble, which collapsed near the end of his administration. Much of the low unemployment and higher revenue to the government can be attributed to that.\n\nUnemployment declined for most of the Bush administration, the economy was growing, it's just that Bush was unlucky enough to see the burst of the housing market bubble which had been growing steadily for a few administrations. It doesn't surprise me that the economy did well for most of his administration, even with his relatively progressive policies, such as forcing ethanol to be added to all gasoline, directed tax cuts for energy efficiency (all directed tax cuts are social engineering), etc. Bush was responsible however for some of the largest tax cuts the poor have seen in quite a long time.\n\nBy the way, if free trade is truly free, then how does any president effect it? The idea of free trade is hands off.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If it's less concentrated, it won't be dangerous.\n\nWe can use it to create more batteries for long distance space crafts. (Nuclear batteries are used in space probes because they produce a steady supply of energy for long periods of time) Maybe we could also use it for heating in really cold regions like arctic bases.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Plus the hidden costs of taxes that have been embedded in the cost.\n\nWe'll also ignore the cost of adding a minimum of 10% ethanol to every gallon of gas. Ethanol burns less efficiently and has a lower energy content than gasoline so you do not get as many miles to the gallon. Plus it's hydrophilic (draws in water) so it damages the car as you burn it.\n\nRemoving the gas taxes alone would reduce the price of gas by about $0.60 on average and removing the ethanol would increase your mileage and life span of your car.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Places that perform abortion have to comply with safety standards? We don't need any regulations to keep us safe after all. It's not like we need to perform medical procedures in a safe environment.\n\nWhat ever happened to regulations being required to make sure companies, etc don't harm people? But hey, that's only when you're not having an abortion I guess.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nEvidently you did not read the article, nor are you aware of the real issue.  The state of Virginia has passed a law that imposes draconian standards specifically for clinics that perform abortions.  The intention of this law is to make abortions inaccessible to women.  Further, it is another conservative attack on Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhile you play rhetorical gotcha, the ability (and right) for a woman to control her body and make her own decisions is diminished.  Perhaps controlling women gives you joy?\n\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nI don't listen to Glenn Beck.

We start by talking to our friends and families and maybe even trying to start a small business ourselves if we have a useful skill set and get our friends and family to support it.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Well, ignoring that, there is no established fact that our national language is English, that's why more and more we are seeing Spanish occurring right next to English for all items and services, in fact, there are many times now where knowing English is less important than knowing Spanish for a job.\n\nIf we did establish this, then we could set forth programs to increase English literacy and competency. Without the establishment of English as a national language, it would be more difficult to justify reinforcing the teaching of the English language.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

You exist today because a lot of people had sex, and naturally people who had the most sex had the most babies. In evolution the people who have the most babies win because whoever has the most babies will be most representative of a species.\n\nFast forward millions of years, and you end up with humans beings who are healthier when they have sex on a regular basis. It relieves stress, it involves close social contact, promotes well-being, etc. Sex is not optional for most people who want to remain healthy.\n\nAt the beginning of human civilization it was necessary to make lots of babies mainly because other than fecundity humans are very ill equipped to deal with the natural world. Comparatively we have poor body strength, immune systems, reflexes, senses, etc even when compared to our closest ape ancestors. We survived our early evolutionary years because we are good at making babies.\n\nOver time, social and technological developments would make baby making less and less important for the survival of the human species because attrition of babies dramatically decreased, and far more survived to adulthood then ever before.\n\nToday we have bodies evolved to need sex, but have sociological and technological developments that make having unnecessary babies detrimental. Babies consume resources, and with most of today\u2019s babies reaching adulthood, not all of those babies will have resources to consume.\n\nThis is why free birth control (abortion, pills, etc) is good. Having unnecessary babies causes financial strain on the family, causes strain on societal resources, increases crime, and a host of other negative consequences all of which cost money to fix. By providing free birth control you are avoiding the far more costly consequences of allowing unnecessary babies to be born.\n\nA person's right over what happens to their own body is one of the most precious rights we have. Acknowledgement of this right prevents all manner of atrocities (non-voluntary organ harvesting, slavery, etc), and protects those who do not have enough money/power to be protected otherwise. Without the right to abortion any other rights women have are meaningless as they are only one rape away from being treated subhuman. Every woman should have the right to get an abortion if she chooses to do so.\n\nThe fetus is a potential person that looks increasingly human during development. However, without the necessary mental development acquired through experiencing life after birth it is no more a person than a skin cell because it does not have a personality matrix.\u00a0\n\nWithout a personality matrix it is no more a person than a doll made of meat. The only reason that human babies look like \u201clittle people\u201d is to engender parental feelings after birth by making them look cute and non-threatening so that we do not kill or eat them. This is something that developed over millions of years of evolution, and can be seen in a wide variety of other animals.\n\nAnti-Abortionists view women as baby factories to pump out units to further their agenda. They don't care about the actual children. If they did they wouldn't orgasm every time the Republitards suggest cutting back on social programs that help/protect mothers/children.\n\nAnti-Abortionists = \"We want you to poop out babies until you DIE, and we are not going to help you in any way that actually costs us to take care of all those children. Just make sure you brainwash them to be religious/vote Republican before they die of starvation, or end up in jail. Hurr hurr derp derp.\"\n\nReligions get their power base mostly by brainwashing innocent children into their warped delusional view of reality. It's a form of enforced mental retardation that I liken to child abuse. So it's really no wonder religions oppose anything that doesn't have women pooping out babies until they die. Reproductive control/choice threatens Religion\u2019s power base.\n\nHere is the fundamental difference between pro-choice, and anti-choice people.\n\nPro-abortion = Fighting for the right to control their own bodies.\n\nAnti-abortion = Fighting for the right to control the bodies of other people.\n\nAnti-abortionists are evil.\n\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nRomney trying to have both sides of a political position?

I am saying that forcing people to purchase health insurance does absolutely nothing, and nationalization makes things worse in most cases. I am calling for a decentralized program run on the state and local level that works with HSAs and private insurance.\n\nDo you know what the one greatest cause of increasing health care costs is? Health insurance. Since people don't pay out of pocket, they don't care what it costs. It's the same thing with the rising tuition at colleges.

Given that the majority of children spend a fair amount of time with others at a young age due in part to daycare and early education, I'm sure they get a lot of interaction with different gender people.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It's not just the fact content that you have to worry about; beans, rice, etc contain a large amount of carbohydrates and you need to eat a lot in order to get enough protein. On top of that there are certain nutrients that are almost impossible to get such as B12 without supplementation, which would make you permanently reliant on a lab.\n\nIt's not a bad short term diet, and I know people who do fine on it for years, but there is serious doubt among the nutritionist community as to whether or not the diet can be sustained for life.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I think not.\n\nOur technology is constantly evolving. Our knowledge on how to utilize land productively is constantly evolving.\n\nOne of my focuses is hydroponics and aquaculture. It's possible to produce massive amounts of food, packed with nutrients, with little impact to the environment, if done properly, and as you mentioned, nuclear done properly can produce huge amounts of energy. It can also be safe and clean if done properly.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Waste products can be utilized in other fashions. In fact Thorium hybrid plants can be used to reduce the amount of nuclear waste we currently have.\n\nOf course adding more energy sources isn't the only part of the solution.

Reactors are starting to be switched over to Thorium now. There already were smaller model reactors. This is not an on paper idea.\n\nYour argument about the carbon needed is a flawed argument. I think even you'd have to admit that. If you're referring to the fossil fuels needed to create the energy to mine the initial ore and create the plants then the same is true for the mining of all of the rare earths, etc and producing solar panels and other \"alternative\" energy projects.\n\nAs for priorities of governments, the United States holds a large portion of the Thorium reserves meaning it could become an energy exporter. India is the other large holder of Thorium. That's why India has been pushing for Thorium.\n\nWind, solar, and tidal power doesn't work because it would take over one hundred years to implement.

Printing money does not increase the net worth of the country. Printing money merely devalues each dollar leading to increased inflation. That is why I often say debt bubble/dollar bubble like the ones in Germany and Zimbabwe. We've actually had similar situations in this nation before I believe and it resulted in a serious mess and that was when the nation didn't even have a massive infrastructure that relied on the market system.\n\nSurely you have the actual statistical data for those nations and have a comparison sample right? You can't say that one population is different from another without samples from both populations.\n\nAgain. You're claim is that if we look at the European Union nations then we should see evidence that the ones with stimulus outperformed the ones with austerity right?

I have not been to Japan but I have studied it in a fair amount of detail.\n\nThat sentence seems way too formal to be natural. Nihonjin ja nai.\n\nIn any case, the point is that after Japan attempted to stimulate its economy, there was a long period of economic stagnation. Japan has since averaged near zero economic growth (meaning negative growth in terms of output per capita). Prices in Japan are quite high, and while there is a high level of employment, that often does not meet the demands of the high cost of living.\n\nThe other issue is that poverty in Japan is not so out in the open making it difficult to get a real handle on the level. Most estimates are probably under estimates, not over estimates.\n\nhttp://www.economist.com/node/21549003\n\nhttp://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CD8QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.japantimes.co.jp%2Ftext%2Ffl20120520rp.html&ei=YJLlUOraOuSA0AHknoDwAQ&usg=AFQjCNGz08JdUL8FpQl-BEV37dgziZjnHA&sig2=_rmK_c6_qVTMyFlDxtf26Q&bvm=bv.1355534169,d.dmQ\n\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2012/0814/Japan-s-poverty-gap-has-politicians-calling-for-rise-in-minimum-wage (my prediction, no change or a worsening of the situation if they raise the minimum wage)\n\nI can go on, but I think that's good for now.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I see it as a natural consequence of human interaction, but not a positive one. One could think of government as a rock and a hill. The top of the hill is flat and the rock just sits there, but once the rock gets going, its natural tendency is to roll downhill until it crushes what's below, and the only way to prevent this is to constantly push back against the rock, after all, even just letting the rock be, it will roll down hill.\n\nIn this case the rock rolling down hill is the centralization of control and the loss of freedom by the people. However instead of pushing back against the rock to prevent it from crushing what's below, the majority of people now are on the other end of the rock trying to push it down faster!\n\nI highly doubt we'd be able to come to a middle ground on this concept because of vastly differing views, but it's still interesting to discuss opposing view points. After all, I don't expect someone to just randomly say, \"you know, you're right, government's rubbish\", but maybe the idea of a decentralized control structure will peak an interest.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Another important connection here is that these inputs all kill the microbial life in the soil.  It's not easy to kick that addiction and restore healthy soil, but if you do, the benefits are numerous.  Restoring land means building up carbon in humus, roots, beneficial fungi that supply minerals from subsoil, bacteria, worms, and countless little beasties that (shut up, Monsanto!) are mainly GOOD for plants and soil.  \n\n\nBy the way, that carbon that builds up in the soil comes from the CO2 in the atmosphere that is in excess supply there.  (Much of that CO2 actually was emitted because of soil depletion.)  Also, when your soil is rich in carbon it holds water like a sponge, and is naturally resistant to drought and flood.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nBut again you ignore the fact that commodity farming is pushed by way of agriculture subsidies.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Obamacare is undermining Obamacare. PPACA was nothing more than another piece of corporate welfare. For one thing, it creates a forced market for the largest insurance companies. For another, take a look at who is doing the \"repairs\" for the Obamacare site. It's a unit of Untied Health Group, the largest insurance company in the country. Basically, United Health and most likely BCBS will dominate, and the exchange will just become a huge market for the two largest names in health insurance.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Again, United Health is getting quite a bit of revenue from this project.

Government manipulates the dynamics of the market and changes what can evolve within it. Walmart is always a good example, since it relies so heavily on the government. So let's examine that institution.\n\nWalmart's net profits for the last few years have averaged around $16B. Walmart receives roughly $14B in revenue from food stamps. Continuing with food stamps for a moment, the average Walmart employee would not be able to survive on their current pay, without the existence of food stamps. Now, a big government supporter might say, \"see, this is why we need food stamps\", but realize that without these programs, Walmart would have no choice but to pay their employees more or else they would simply lose their work force! So, that would be another huge added cost without government.\n\nIn addition, it receives one sided tax breaks that small businesses wouldn't receive. Not only that, but they use eminent domain in order to obtain property that they normally would not be able to obtain or would only be able to obtain at a far higher price.\n\nHowever, the support Walmart receives doesn't end there! One of the reasons that a lot of the products are so inexpensive at Walmart, especially the food, is because of the government subsidization of agriculture, which artificially deflates the price of foods produced by mega corporations and sold by institutions like Walmart.\n\nIn other words, without government those big corporations that are causing so many problems wouldn't even exist! They would collapse under their own weight in a free market.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

There were only a handful of companies producing all the beer for the United States. When Carter legalized home brewing, and states restricted other laws, it opened up the microbrew market. The handful of beer companies soon grew to thousands, and while the handful of beer companies that existed before the change still have a huge market share, that share has been slipping more and more. http://www.synthesis.cc/2010/03/micro-brewing-the-bioeconomy-beer-as-an-example-of-distributed-biological-manufacturing.html\n\nTechnically the liquor industry was more of an example of an oligarchy than a monopoly, but we don't really have situations in this country where only a <b>single</b> business dominates the entire market right now, so really the changes you want to see are to prevent the oligarchies that currently exist, not monopolies that do not exist. However, the dynamics in play regarding monopolies are the same ones that affect oligarchies anyway.\n\nSo now answer a few questions before we move on.

It helps the largest insurance companies immensely. This is not a TP talking point in the least. It seems to me that the TP keeps calling ACA socialism and saying that it will hurt insurance companies. Well, it might hurt small insurance companies, but not the likes of BCBS and UnitedHealth.\n\nAgain, the costs haven't all been totaled. Continued repairs are still costing money. In addition, a lot of estimates only take into account contracts to CGI and exclude indirect costs.\n\nThe system may be improved, but it's still not very good. It's bad enough to warrant a MJ author to write an article regarding how to sign up without the exchange!\n\nNo; I am not saying that Google should have gotten the contracts, but are CGI (a company known for producing garbage) and QSSI (a unit of the largest health insurance company in the nation) the only options from which they could have selected?\n\nYou're right that no system that size is going to be fault free, but there's a difference between fault free and a system loaded with flaws.\n\n\"...the system is <b>nothing more than a portal</b> for signing up for health insurance for the ACA. You don't like it? Fine, sign up using some other means. <b>You won't get a subsidy</b>...\"\n\nNote that the two segments in bold contradict each other. If it is a system that provides a subsidy benefit, then it is more than a portal.\n\nI already told you what is broken. The exchange system, and the fact that it is basically a form of corporate welfare. Just like Romney's version, on which ACA is based, it is causing an increase in health insurance costs, it is causing people to lose their coverage (regardless of the false promises by the administration), it is increasing the profits for the largest health insurance companies. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

However, even then I cannot support the claim that small businesses rely on SNAP so much that they would go out of business without it. Especially when you take into account an increased number of customers as Walmart shuts down shops.\n\n\nNote I would also couple reduction of SNAP benefits with ending the war on drugs which is one of the leading causes of crime and thus poverty.\n\n\nIn any case, since we are in agreement that mega corporations like Walmart <b>need</b> SNAP in order to survive, we can go back to the original point which is that depressed populations are being used for the benefit of mega corporations. These populations tend to be \"black\" and much of that is due to intentional targeting by the legal system.\n\n\nTherefore these populations are being used, not even as slaves, but almost as livestock. They live under a false sense of freedom and that is why they are even worse off now than under the overt slavery of the past.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

That is the only answer that I can think of that might appeal to a sociopath.\n\n\nPeople with empathy (something needed in order to have healthy relationships with others) may not want illegals to come here, but they also will have compassion for children (at least as young as 7 from the article) who are lost, abandoned, frightened, and left on their own to figure out how to find food and shelter. Some of those might find a way to help. Some might find ways to put pressure on those nations to start taking care of their own. Some may put pressure on our government to get US corporations to stop mucking about in lands south of our border that makes it so difficult for the people there to find work.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIt's not a pivot. You cited 4.3.2 which specifically mentions <b>needful</b> rules. Regulating immigration is not needful, and therefore is not constitutional, even if you stretch 4.3.2 to include border security.\n\nMaybe you find it so odd that I am opposed to \"border security\" because I am not a \"conservative\".

In my town, there are unregistered guns, bought illegally, hidden all over the place. As long as you know where they are, you can just go to the drop spot, use the gun, and then rehide it and let everyone know where it is. But sure...gun control's gonna stop that.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nBecause Australia.\n\nYou are making the point, actually.  In your town, there are guns everywhere.  That's exactly the problem.  If there were fewer of them, there'd be less problem.\n\nOffer buybacks for the guns that are out there.  Nobody's confiscating your guns, but if you'd like to make some cash discarding some of the extras you've got, it's your choice.\n\nRestrict new gun purchases to defensive and sporting weapons only.  You don't need weapons of war (offensive weapons) unless you want to join the \"well-regulated militia\".  We already don't generally let civilians buy M-60 machine guns, all we're doing is moving that dividing line further down the scale.  Even Justice Scalia said the 2nd Amendment isn't absolute.\n\nLifetime ownership.  You buy a gun, its serial number and ballistic prints are registered to you for life.  Your only transfer options are the buyback program or passing it down to family who then get the lifetime ownership.  If your gun is used to harm another, you get 50% of whatever punishment the shooter gets.  Theft of your gun is no defense - gee, didn't you have a gun to deter theives?  (Wanna bet folks will be extra careful to lock up their guns?)\n\n\nBullet control.  The 2nd Amendment protects the right to bear arms.  It doesn't say a thing about ammo.  Regulate the hell out of ammo purchases.  Background check for every purchase.  Quantity limits.  You name it.\n\nWhen I hear \"guns don't kill people, people kill people\" I think I agree, and it seems that the people in the United States like to kill people quite often with guns.  When I hear \"it's mental health, it's culture\" I think I agree, and it seems we have a crazy killing culture.  If we're such a crazy killing nation, perhaps we should have fewer guns to crazily kill each other with.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nOkay. Here we go again. Gun laws do not reduce violent crime rates. Unless we can fix the underlying causes of these mass killings, we won't change anything. In addition, while the mass killings are certainly big \"news\" they account for only a small fraction of violent crimes in this country. It's just easier for the average person, who can only focus on a few things at a time, to relate to large scale events.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Government will always try to form and manipulate the market system. I am arguing that we should do our best to allow free market dynamics to resolve our resource management problem.\n\n\nSingapore is a pretty good example of limited government at play. It is not a perfect example by any means, but there you go. Even European nations that are performing at their best, while not exactly small, have far less influence on their markets because they are far more decentralized, increasing competition and decreasing the spread of corruption.\n\n\nPeople use Somalia as the counter example to libertarian policies, but when you actually study Somalia, besides learning that the system in place is in on way voluntary and the current state of affairs are the result of massive government intervention via imperialism and civil war, you'll find that after the fall of the last major government, most of the socioeconomic indicators improved.\n\n\nI am argue for the least amount of government with the most decentralized topology that we can push to get.

This is even more of an issue in my opinion. At least with GMO plants, there's clear work done by the entity doing the patent. In many cases, nonGMO plants that are patented simply happen to be found on the entity's property.

I have a paper, which even though incomplete, details the issue with government as the method of resource management in society and why the market system is preferable.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They have this odd rejection of market dynamics and a misconception of how the market works. For one thing, they seem to equate market dynamics with profit. I'm not sure why. They also seem to equate market dynamics with mega corporations. I really do not see why, since mega corporations are inexorably linked to government.\n\n\nIf you don't think market dynamics can solve these problems, take a look at a similar problem: cellular carriers. They are a government supported oligarchy.

Humans are naturally greedy beyond kin relationships.\n\n2. Kin relationships are naturally limited by our neurobiology, but can be extended to a degree using culture, especially through the formation of pseudo-kin relationships such as religious groups or states. However, this results in many problems such as the \"outsider effect\" where aggression is shown towards anyone not in the group.\n\n\n\n3. Violence tends to reduce with interdependence. Our ability to manipulate our environment has allowed us to produce a large capital inventory which makes us interdependent on one another.\n\n\n4. Humans are naturally conspicuous consumers. It helps increase our odds of reproducing. Therefore a consumer economy makes sense, especially when tied with 3.\n\n\n5. Models in the market evolve over time. Evolving systems are better suited to handle optimization problems when there are gaps in our knowledge of how the system works.\n\n\n6.

So you either have a system that's basically devoid of property rights, in which it just comes down to who has the greater physical ability to pump it out fastest, or you have to make up some rules.\n\n\nAgain, you are lumping together rights and protocols. There is a huge difference. And yes, markets depend on cultural protocols. But no; you are not paying for the property right. You are paying for the property, and for the contractual agreement, and as a consequence receive the right, as per the definition of right mentioned earlier in this discussion.\n\n\nThere is a subtle but very important distinction between right and cultural protocol. Separating the two makes it much easier to discuss actions in society. Conflating the two makes it much more difficult.\n\n\nIn any case, market solutions, in my opinion, would be the preferable solution. Economic interdependence means that people will work together and an optimal resource management solution will be reached.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Go see which foods are grabbed first in lines at your local food banks. Fish and chicken go faster than hotdogs.  Oranges and fresh green beans go faster than cans of pork and beans. While you are there, donate some good fresh organic beef or other food.

Living in the real world? In the real world, people who are given power will use that power for their own gains. This makes government inherently flawed, if you are looking for a system in which there is a relatively equal distribution of wealth.\n\nMore reality? A system does not need to have a rational driver. Self organization is a reality.

Basically, you can find out quite a bit of what I think by reading my blog, if you wish to do so.\n\n\nThe bulk of my ideas can be summarized in my draft paper that I am writing, which discusses economics and government from an evolutionary point of view. Essentially, government is ill suited to human nature as well as the resource management problem. We need to rely on a system which is in line with our nature and is capable of solving the resource management problem. That system is the system of evolutionary dynamics that exist in market systems.\n\nThat answers the first two questions.

Government pushed for the transcontinental railroad. They gave these companies low/no risk loans thus allowing them to accumulate massive fortunes.\n\n\nBut that's not the end of the story.

Regardless, it is generally agreed that the preamble is in no way legally binding and is not to be used in jurisprudence.\n\nLaw is shaped by the way the majority of the justices rule at the time, but that does not change whether or not a law is constitutional. Constitutionality is set by the constitution and nothing else. It is simply an obligation of the Supreme Court to rule in accordance with it.\n\n\nAnd in the case of whether or not the constitution grants the government the authority to regulate immigration, even the SCOTUS has come to the conclusion that the power doesn't rest with the constitution but with so called inherent powers of a sovereign nation.\n\n\nHowever, answer this: what becomes of the tenth amendment in light of the concept of inherent powers of the federal government? I'm sure your sixth grade civics class went over that, yes?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

GREAT BIG JUICY LIES. Why would you waste my time and yours regurgitating this PR garbage? For the past 30 years they've absolutely pounded us with the claim that \"GMOs MEAN LESS PESTICIDE USE.\" Turns out to be their biggest lie yet. Instead, we're using more pesticides than ever because the weeds and the bugs have developed immunity. Which is why the gentech crowd now wants to use on our food the same super poisons they used during the war in Southeast Asia.\n\"GMOs MEAN BIGGER HARVESTS.\" Sure, for the first couple of years, and then the lie becomes truly apparent when GMOs give you SMALLER harvests than the conventional seeds you were using.. at higher costs. This is one of the lies that has led to widespread failure of mom&pop farms: they were told to expect great things and ended up drowning in debt. And while there's plenty of press about suicide rates AMONG FARMERS in India the media hardly ever mentions the suicides occurring in other parts of the world like Australia where church groups have created suicide watch squads to keep an eye on farmers driven into debt'n'desperation by Monsanto and their agtech comrades. \nWhat about the \"FEED THE WORLD\" lie? Conventional plant breeders and small farms supply more than 75% of the world's food, and agribusiness provides debt'n'degradation for human health and Mother Nature with tons of poisons that fill our air and water. The TRUTH is that it's NOT getting better.\nLast, but not least, is the lie about \"SAFETY.\" Since our tax dollars are no longer used to do the testing and analysis of GMOs and the chemical poisons stream we have no way of knowing if the testing that's SUPPOSEDLY being done by Monsanto&Friends is on the up'n'up.\nHow did companies whose main products have been poisons and biological weapons of war get control of food policy for much of the known world? First, by telling lies, AND, by paying big dividends to politicians, professors, and reporters.\nA leopard cannot change its spots. In this case those spots are named PCB's, DDT, 2-4-D, RoundUp, Aspartame, Saccharin, Bovine Growth Hormone, Agent Orange, and more. Certainly enough toxic spots to to cover the animal, AND, to let us know without any doubt that we're dealing with a wild and dangerous beast. This article just represents our willingness to swallow more lies. (sigh)\nFor decades I was able to feed family and neighbors for blocks around with a huge variety of fruits and vegetables from relatively small gardens, without a huge amount of work. I did so with the same knowledge my mother and grandfather got from their parents and grandparents. Not one chemical. Not one GMO. Currently we have one-and-a-half times the food needs of every individual on the planet, and most of that food ends up dumped in the ocean. Big Ag has a great racket going and the taxpayers are footing the bill. And the media falls all over itself to lend a hand.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nNothing beneficial and quite a bit that's harmful. The problem is, welfare programs for mega corps are often masked as welfare programs for the masses. I'll probably get some attacks for saying this, but food stamps help Walmart and in the long run, hurt the people. Such programs take revenue out of the economy as a whole and transfer it to the companies that focus on foodstamp sales. Walmart is the largest recipient. Such programs also allow companies like Walmart to pay lower wages.\n\n\nEssentially, without those programs, as well as use of eminent domain and other advantages, Walmart would have to contract by a large amount opening up the market for new players.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And in the case of Pertussis, it is possible that it is not the number of cases that has changed so much but the number of identified cases. As for measles, I would say that the bulk of the drop in cases is due to vaccination. The bulk of the decrease in mortality is due to other medical advances, as is indicated by the drop in mortality rates far preceeding the introduction of the vaccination.\n\nThen of course there is the shift in quality of sanitation and hygeine, although it's questionable how much of an impact that has.

I can tell you that it is likely that it does not exist for Pertussis. You seem to think that I don't have any understanding of medical science. I do. And yeah, I can read a study just fine. Here are a few:\n\n\"Acellular pertussis vaccines protect against disease but fail to prevent infection and transmission in a nonhuman primate model\" and \"Pertussis infection in fully vaccinated children in day-care centers, Israel\" discuss asymptomatic carriers resulting from incomplete vaccination. I'm on a tablet and switching tabs causes the page to reload, so I can't get the exact article names for the others.\n\nZhang et al. 2014 attempts to get an idea of how many asymptomatic carriers there are. In that study, Chinese school aged children (7 - 15), who are asymptomatic, are tested for Pertussis using both cultures and PCR. PCR came back positive 4.8% of the time. Note that this is not annual positive cases. This is a snapshot. What does that mean for the United States? Well, assuming that we have only 10% of that rate in the US (just to give myself tons of buffer space) that would still mean that at any given time there are about 150,000 asymptomatic cases. I would love to set up a study to test that, but like I said, I gave myself a lot of room for error. The last study that I will cite is something along the lines of \"Modeling the Effects of Carriers on Transmission...\"\n\nBasically, if the parameters are correct, you would see an increase in the rate of infection rather than a decrease, and with 150,000+ carriers among school aged children... well...\n\n> But, you know, keep on believing that it doesn't. As someone who holds graduate degrees in hard sciences and whose entire family are in the science and public health fields as doctors and researchers\n\nThis is called appeal to authority. It is fallacious if either (1) you are not an authority, and holding a degree in a hard science does not make you an authority,  or (2) the other person has made a specific argument, which I have.

Okay.\n\n1. Fine. I shouldn't have said \"that's obvious.\" However, it is a reasonable hypothesis that the risk associated with vaccination is at least additive.\n\n2. Again, you're ignoring the impact of asymptomatic carriers on rates of infection. It requires the correct parameters, but it certainly is possible. And as I said, we are seeing asymptomatic carriers in fully vaccinated populations and in mostly vaccinated populations.\n\nI am currently working on a compartmental model specific to B. pertussis and related species. I am utilizing existing work on two models: an S-I-Ic-R model which takes into account asymptomatic carriers (but does not consider the carriers to be infectious) and an S-I-V-R model which takes into account waning immunity.\n\nThe problem with B. pertussis studies is that the carriers seem to be infectious and the vaccine's efficacy wanes rapidly. Therefore both factors need to be taken into account.\n\nBut consider the Chinese study (I can link to it if you want). 0.3% of the sample tested positive through culture samples and 4.8% through PCR. Now since the former underestimates by a lot and the latter has a tendency to create false positives, it's still difficult to get a handle on how many infections there are, but assume the 0.3% and scale that to Americans aged 7 - 15. You're still talking 150,000. We can't get a handle on how common this infection is if we do not have an idea of how many carriers there are.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

My views are based on a multifaceted analysis of market systems. It's based on the information we have of human evolutionary psychology, an analogy between biological sytems and markets, human history, and much more.\n\nWe can look at this housing program as a very watered down version of the system put into place by ancient Egypt, which was almost entirely redistributive. Did it function? Yes. Although it relied on a very powerful state religion. How did it function? People believed that the state and their god were one and the same. Therefore they gave everything they had to the state. The state then utilized government programs to redistribute the resources back to the people. It ensured that everyone had the absolute minimum necessary to survive, but little else.\n\nBy the way, reducing the college debt bubble by giving alternative education routes and improving trades is something Rand would suggest? \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

THEN we know what we must do to get conditions that we want.\n\nThe problem with economics is that it relies on philosophical reasoning rather than scientific investigation. That is why I do not rely on it and instead use theories established by evolutionary psychologists, anthropologists, mathematicians, etc to support my position as well as produce an analogy between biological systems and markets, which I then support with further evidence.\n\nMarkets are cultural adaptations which work with human nature rather than against it. They reduce the use of violence in resource management and replace it with voluntary exchanges. Govermment on the other hand, gives a group of people authority over the masses. This is a problem because it is part of our nature to use power to our advantage. \n\nThat's the evolutionary psych component. The biological analogy looks at the similarities between governments and agriculturalists. It is amazing how similar they are once you apply the analogy. Domesticated market entities become unhealthy and dependent on the government. Competition is reduced, although \"weeds\" do emege.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Please rethink that. Second, look at the influx of students into the college system: students who should not be going to college. The first year of college is essentially 13th grade at this point. That increases cost. \n\nOr do you not consider the fact that so many people drop out of college to have a huge impact on cost?\n\nTake a look at this: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR/countries\n\nThe United States has a 94% enrollment rate in tertiary education, measured as followed: \"Gross enrolment ratio. Tertiary (ISCED 5 and 6). Total is the total enrollment in tertiary education (ISCED 5 and 6), regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the total population of the five-year age group following on from secondary school leaving.\"\n\n94 percent! Now compare that to Japan's 61% Now that's definitely higher than it was in 2000 when it was 47.7%\n                            for Japan and 72.6% for the United States, but you get the idea: Japan sends far less of its population to college.\n\nAnd YET there isn't much of a difference in the percentage of the population who have completed college: http://www.nchems.org/pubs/docs/Closing%20the%20U%20S%20%20Degree%20Gap%20NCHEMS%20Final.pdf\n\nWhat does that say? There's a HUGE dropout rate.\n\nSubsidies also increase cost because people don't actually pay out of pocket. Think about it this way. If people could not pay $x for a service, the service won't be purchased. Subsidies and college loans lift pricing pressure. This coupled with massive demand produced by the false notion that college is somehow necessary for us to have the level of education necessary to survive in today's world, increases the cost.\n\nBy the way, do you happen to have data for state expenditures on college? I can only find combined education spending, which over the decades has increased substantially, even as the quality of our education system has largely declined: http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_1940_2014USd_16s2li011mcn_20s\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

If we scale that to the US we're talking about 150,000 asymptomatic cases among American school aged children in a given four month period (assuming the LOW value).\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

No, we're just waking up to the effects of a failed War on Drugs, misguided 3-strikes sentencing, Jim Crow racketeering in local government and endemic poverty. The confederacy was beaten only on the battlefield. States rights were and are a haven for local government abuse and criminalization of minorities. Only federal power guarantees equality before the law. \n\n\nAmerica isn't uniformly just, prosperous, educated, healthy or even developed. Blue states form an advanced nation.

Sorry. I edited this post for additional information that you must not have seen:\n\n** Edit: In addition you have yet to show how such a restriction comes from Lemon v. Kurtzman which says that a law can neither advances nor inhibits religion.\n\nIf you are arguing that such requirements that a warden cannot force a person to go to church, does restrict (inhibit) religion, then a simple logical test will suggest that its validity does not come from the Lemon test.\n\nLet's make this simpler. We'll convert the Lemon test to a mathematical sentence.\n\nphi(x) = \u00ac (x advances religion \u2228 inhibits religion) where the truth value of phi(x) is the constitutionality of x.\n\nYou admit that x inhibits religion, yes? Then you have:\n\nphi(x)\n= \u00ac (U \u2228 T)\n= \u00ac T\n= F\n\nThus by the Lemon test, x is unconstitutional.\n\nIs phi(x) incorrect, because you already stated that x inhibits religion.\n\nThe Lemon law basically prevented any law from giving support to a religion. Your argument seems to be that without x, religion would advance, but we do not discuss the constitutionality of absence of law. That makes no sense. We can only address whether a law is constitutional or not.

I go into quite a bit of detail to support the definition that I provide and also note that it is similar to, but distinct from, Jan Van Baal's definition. The definition is supported by past definitions, by its usefulness in determining religion from non religion (and I go and address various religions and non religions and show that the filter works), and from its basis in Hitchens' razor.\n\nHere is the definition that I present, starting with the concept of a religious filter which is as follows: a religious belief is a claim for which there is no known method of obtaning empirical evidence. \n\nA religion is a non empty collection of religious beliefs along with a collection of patterns of behavior associated with those beliefs.\n\nThis is similar to Jan Van Baal's (a well respected anthropologist whose expertise is in religion) definition which is essentially \"all explicit and implicit notions and ideas, accepted as true, which relate to a reality which cannot be verified empirically\". \n\nCare to discuss your issue with either definition?\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Well, then I guess I must be the first. Consider markets, and the larger anthroposystems (analogous to ecosystems) as a whole, and view them like you would a biological system (really they are biological systems - just inorganic). \n\nEvolutionary dynamics drives a system away from such accumulation of wealth since it reduces net effective return on energy. Monopolies, while useful in some instances, are short lived with evolutionary dynamics in place, as models which reproduce generally outlast those that do not. Now continuing our biological analogy/extension, we have that governments act essentially as domesticators. They manipulate other entities in the anthrosphere, which creates mutual benefit and reliance between them, at the expense of entities which are not being domesticated.\n\nThis brings us to your next assertion: \"and that they pretty much always do and have [accumulated wealth].\"\n\nConsider any entity which has negatively impacted the anthrosphere. I would argue that the majority of them are domesticated entities or weeds. I would also argue that the probability of selecting such an entity which is not dometicated drops as the length of time it managed to survive increases.\n\nConsider the Robber Barons. They emerged because of the government push for railroad infrastructure. Consider the mafia, and then later the mega breweries. The first was an example of a weed, and the latter an example of a domesticated entity, both related to prohibition.\n\nSo, you can no longer say that no libertarian has demonstrated why it must be true under libertarianism.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And yes, the government can determine whether or not to produce plates with alternative designs, but once they say that they are going to, restricting certain expressions is indeed a violation of the first amendment.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

It does not a question of whether or not it can be performed with the exact protocol in place now. It is a question of whether or not it can be performed. In other words, if procedure can be changed in order to allow same sex marriages without forcing someone to violate his or her religion, then the procedure must be changed. The person cannot be fired in such a case.\n\n> It is: it's forcing same-sex couples to not be married.\n\nOkay. Apparently you do not know what the verb \"to act\" means. Not facilitating a marriage is not forcing someone to act. Voluntary behavior is meaningless to you. Isn't it? In addition, as I said, are you demanding that the procedure cannot be changed in such a way that people will not be forced to violate their religious beliefs regarding marriage while still maintaining the government's ability to officiate same sex marriages?\n\n> She took an oath to uphold the law. She is in violation of her oath regardless of her religious beliefs.\n\nThis is circular reasoning.

I've read in numerous places  she roughly fought the Obama campaign to a draw in the raw primary vote.

You stay Classy, Kevvie.\"\n\nAnd yet... you say absolutely nothing to dispute the comparison.  Sanders and Trump are both populists who are using the framework of a political party to run an egocentric campaign.  Neither man has much history with the political affiliation he's now claiming.  Neither man would have a solid base of support in Congress to pass new laws.  Neither man has demonstrated any knowledge of foreign policy or any skill at working with our allies.  Both men seem to make pie-in-the-sky promises without thinking through the details of how to make them happen.\n\nTrump and Sanders are two sides of the same coin.  If you want to disprove that, you'll need to ditch the namecalling and provide some evidence and logic.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nActually, if you look at the OECD reports, the United States spends more than most other countries, on primary and secondary education. One thing I find amazing about \"progressives\" is how obsessed they are with money. \n\nFree college is tough to implement in any college, which is why many countries, with these programs, are facing severe budget challenges. However, it's impossible to do here, for a variety of reasons. Our entire education and <b>labor system</b> is set up in a completely different way than in countries with free college.\n\nIn these countries, trade schools, on the job training, etc are far more common. A large number of jobs do not require degrees. Most education is complete by 16, and you start tracking to either university or trade. We don't have that here.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

In any case, if you really want to know, I have an A.S. in Engineering, an A.S. in Computer Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics w/ a minor in anthropology, as well as two archaeology field schools and an archaeology research assistantship under my belt. All together I have about 250 someodd credits in various courses, ranging from undergrad through graduate level.

It's not an argument at all. Saying that their claims about parenting are incorrect, because they are whores, would be an ad hominem argument.

Are you saying the government has no right to protect the rights of persons against religious oppression by other persons? \n\nNo. I am saying that refusing to serve someone is not a violation of that person's rights. A right is that which you enjoy in the absence of others, not something which requires others to enjoy. If you need to force someone to act in order to enjoy it, then it is not a right.\n\nWe cannot really go further with this discussion if you refuse to realize this point.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022China\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Media\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Drugs\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Assault weapons account for a tiny fraction of annual gun crimes anyway...we need to spend the political capital/momentum on a more effective strategy for harm reduction like universal, nationwide background checks for all firearms sales/transfers. National mandatory safe storage laws would also prevent thousands of deaths and/or thefts. Both these measures would likely pass constitutional scrutiny as well.
