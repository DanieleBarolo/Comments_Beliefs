Obviously not, I don't hear HL screaming that the two week pay period violates their religious beliefs, although the Bible clearly states that wages should be paid daily before sundown. Having all that cash on hand just to comply with a Biblical mandate is clearly too much to take on for a legally fictitious entity whose raison d'etre is to generate profit. Similar deal with taking and giving interest bearing loans.

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

PARENT COMMENT:
I wonder what would happen if Hobby Lobby would need to make a religious decision that would cost them a lot of money. Would they still insist on following their religious rules then?
