<blockquote>In other words...they're only harming themselves.</blockquote>
Yet from the article we have:
<blockquote>When that happens, lots of people are put at risk: infants who are too young to get shots … During a California outbreak of pertussis in 2010, more than 9,000 cases were reported, and ten infants died.</blockquote>Unless those 9,000 cases and ten infants were from among only the group you assert would be harming only themselves it would seem your assertion does not hold-up.  Unless perhaps you wish to call for the quarantining of objectors.

It is my "personal belief" that unless there is some medical reason why a child should not be vaccinated, the child should not be exempted - ever. This ridiculous vaccination rebellion is endangering the rest of us, let alone risking the lives of the poor kids whose parents subscribe to this misinformation. The fact that the governments of these states are acting in such a dangerous way is appalling.


This is just another example of how lies are perpetuated by repetition. Science has discredited these myths and yet anti-government paranoids keep hammering away with untruths. People are dying as a result.


As to the religious exemption...what child has a choice about that? Here we have another example of fairy tales in the form of "beliefs" endangering the rest of us. It is worse than immoral. It is arrogantly evil.

PARENT COMMENT:
Nonsense. That sort of ridiculous claim is as bad as the paranoia spread about vaccines. 

Further, if there is enough of a body of individuals in a community, who have refused inoculation of themselves and their children...they're in agreement on the matter that they'd rather risk natural exposure than whatever threat they perceive exists in a vaccination. 

They've accepted it amongst themselves, that, should they encounter and incur contagion, the outcome is their responsibility. 

In other words...they're only harming themselves. If you and yours have been boosted against infection, good for you. But that moral argument, accusing them of endangering one another, why, you might as well come down on motorists for the shared risk of being on a highway with others.

  I could not agree more...IMO It is no different than child abuse.

    It's worse.

With child neglect or abuse, the individual is typically only harming his and her own child- or possibly a neighbors.

These deluded people are potentially harming, maiming and killing thousands.
