Talking with Climate Scientist Michael Mann\n\n# Oldest comment (from the thread):\nIn all walks of personal life it is wise to establish priorities. In world government's, policy makers and politicians, it is imperative that they establish\u00a0priorities. Government leaders are supposed to first protect the citizens which they rule, whether elected or otherwise. \n\nWith global warming now firmly in hand with an atmospheric CO2 level of 400 ppm and rapidly rising, priority's must be established and the number ONE priority related to global warming must be the issue which will at some time in the near future destroy all life on Earth...\u00a0The Arctic's \"Ticking Time Bomb\".\n\nThe Arctic region of Earth is warming much faster than any other location on the planet,\u00a0second is Antarctica.\u00a0 As the Arctic continues\u00a0to heat up the Arctic Ocean sea ice is rapidly disappearing and in the shallow ocean's sub sea floor are trillions of tons of methane gas safely locked\u00a0in frozen\u00a0permafrost. \n\nAs the\u00a0shallow Arctic Ocean becomes ice free the permafrost melts and when ice or permafrost melts,\u00a0ANYTHING locked in the ice or permafrost is freed and if it's a gas, such as methane gas, CH4,\u00a0it then enters the atmosphere. \n\nScientists have learned that\u00a0methane gas is 105 times more potent than is CO2 when it first enters the atmosphere and is still 25 times as potent after it has been in the atmosphere for 100 years.....\u00a0 Therefore; if and when only a trillion tons of methane gas enters the atmosphere from the Arctic's melting permafrost, it would be equal to (*105 trillion tons*) of\u00a0 CO2 added to the atmospheric greenhouse gas mixture.... In 2012 scientists were concerned when human activity emitted 44 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.  44 billion is a pittance when compare to 105 trillion .  \n\nThe result of that happening will be as deadly serious as an incoming asteroid the size of Rhode Island hitting our atmosphere.\u00a0 In other words, it would eradicate almost all life on Earth, leaving bacterial life and perhaps some deep sea life.\u00a0 \n\nNow at the current rate of Arctic sea ice and permafrost melt, that disaster could happen at any time now, two years, three, five\u00a0or ten...\u00a0 No one can predict the exact time we have remaining, but we certainly can predict that it will\u00a0happen if we humans, world governments, who have the power and the finances,\u00a0do nothing about it and allow it to happen. \n\nThe number one priority must be to address\u00a0the Arctic methane issue and indeed there are many other top priorities such as ocean acidification, severe global climate changes, but when establishing priority's there has to be a number ONE.\u00a0 There has to be a number one\u00a0if people in command aren't ignorant of the issue or are stupid.\n\n  http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10773020\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nAnother priority might be to get denialists to understand that explaining only one half of a feedback cycle is similar to not explaining it all, and that this is actually misinformation.

Can't imagine the person that would be happy about tonight.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\n\u00a0Raoul, I feel that I have been very articulate and have adequately explained what my problem is with this case. But here, just because you seem to have a problem with comprehension I will go over one point that you appear to have wrong.\n\nMartin was not acting in any manner that needed to be watched. If my husband or I had seen someone acting off center, he would have called the police and let them handle it. His desire to be a tough guy or but his nose into someone's business would not have been enough to get him to get out of the car and do what he was told not to do. Unless he saw someone attempt to hurt someone else, then we would have attempted to stop that.\n\nWalking down a sidewalk is not suspicious behavior. Talking on a cell phone is not unexpected behavior today. And carrying a drink in one hand......not a dangerous activity had it not been for Zimmerman. My husband's experience in the military and mine being a mother would have been enough for us to know the difference.\n\nMartin may or may not have thrown the first punch. But he had the right under Stand Your Ground, to stand his ground. He was not under any legal responsibility to run home or flee. Zimmerman was the agressor in that he was a stranger following a 17 yr old kid, who was just walking down a sidewalk. \n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nIf it\u00a0 proceeds it would be based on new evidence.\u00a0 His 'immunity' would come from invoking stand your ground protection.\u00a0 That may well be disputable. \n\nIn any case he'll be a martyr to both civil rights advocates and stand your ground law.\u00a0 People won't let this go.\u00a0 It's revived interest in the Marisa Alexander case too.\u00a0 They're both florida justice. \n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Military\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Progressives\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Movies\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022China\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}
