Because hobby lobby requires the employee to cover the premiums for the insurance they selected.

Birth control is one of the most used female prescription medicines (yes it requires at least annual doctors visits)  Since the employee is covering the premiums it should at least cover the largest most common prescription and the required doctors visits that go along with it.

So if hobby lobby decided to no longer cover prostate checks since prostate health can and should be treated by over the counter vitamins according to their non medical opinion you are just hunky dory with that right?!

Basically you believe that a corporate entity should be allowed to practice medicine and determine what health conditions require medical attention and which do not.

All medical professional organizations like the AMA and the ACOG agree that birth control and the ability to prevent (unwanted) pregnancies and space pregnancies are one of the largest most important health improvements for females, by what authority does hobby lobby dismiss that fact as irrelevant

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

PARENT COMMENT:
I can read perfectly fine.  You want those with reproductive organs who want to use them devoid of any responsibility to write letters to Hobby Lobby condemning them for asserting themselves regarding a personal decision and the costs associated with their business.  
If cheap birth control exists out there, why would you expect Hobby Lobby to provide it to their employees?  Wouldn't a trip to 7-11 for some rubbers work just fine?  How about asking the guy to blow his load on your chest?  Never heard of osmosis pregnancies before.  The responsibility you put on an employer for decisions made in a bedroom are simply put- stunted and ill-conceived.  You create the a slippery precedent when personal matters, business matters, and government matters intermingle where they should not.  And kudos on your part attempting to warm the planet that much quicker with a larger carbon foot print in search of framing due to your immorally superior stance on a stupid issue.  Dumb ass

  I wonder what would happen if Hobby Lobby would need to make a religious decision that would cost them a lot of money. Would they still insist on following their religious rules then?

    If enough people write them letters notifying them that they will not purchase from Hobby Lobby (yes, I have), then they have a base from which they can estimate losses. I recommend that move to anyone with reproductive organs.

      Why?  My guess would be that you have never purchased anything from them before so who cares about your letter?  Also- isn't it funny that you marshal the forces of those with reproductive organs - the same organs the birth control you want to see mandated will neutralize before, during, or after sex?  You don't see the irony in your comment?

        Learn to read.  I'm not mandating compulsory sterility. Only yesterday, a large and influential ecumenical council advocated universaliy available and cheap contraception. Anything less is compulsory pregnancy for married cis hetero women and for many others. 
Contrary to your other assertion, I was a frequent HL shopper in the past. If I want framing supplies, I now have to drive an extra 30 miles to purchase them. I grew up in a time when birth control was illegal.  I am the descendant of a midwife and work for a retired midwife.  All pregnancies should be planned and all children should be born into a loving and secure home.
