  "article_body": "Tuesday\u2019sNew York Daily Newscover storyis nothing more than a long-form editorial that attempts to make the AR-15 (asemiautomatic sport rifle) the bad guy in Monday\u2019s horrific Navy Yard shooting. Last night, CNN attempted to do the same through blowhard Piers Morgan. But there is just one problem: CNN andTheDaily Newsare 100% wrong. The FBI hasjust confirmedthat a shotgun and two pistols were recovered, and that the \u201cgunman was NOT armed with [an] AR-15.\u201dTuesday morning\u2019sDaily Newscover hysterically blared, \u201cSame Gun Different Slay.\u201dInside, Mike Lupica continued the blare:This time the shooter is reported to be a Navy reservist named Aaron Alexis and when he is shot dead by law enforcement, taken out before he can put a gun to his own head the way Lanza did, he has his light, handy assault weapon with him, and a semiautomatic pistol, and a shotgun.But even if the shooter had used a semiautomatic rifle (which we now know he didn\u2019t), it would have been one he took from a security guard during the rampage. Maybe theDaily Newsdidn\u2019t get it wrong; maybe Lupica and company are so far over the edge that they are now calling for the American military to be disarmed?Meanwhile, over at CNN, within hours of the shooting, the network allowed Piers Morgan to launchhis own sanctimonious attack against the AR-15:\u2014\u2014But just a few hours later, CNN had to walk it back. Buried in an article singling out the AR-15, CNNreportedthat an AR-15 was not found on the scene.Apparently, sometime yesterday, the talking point went out that said that the anti-gun narrative coming out of the Navy Yard shootings would be to turn the AR-15 into this massacre\u2019s convenient left-wing bogeyman\u00a0 \u2014 all in an effort to get it banned.The left-wing, anti-science media blows it again by caring more about the agenda than the facts.This is especially devastating for CNN, a cable network desperate to get off the floor after non-stop debacles involving theBoston Marathon bombing, being caughtopenly pushing for gun control, and all things George Zimmerman. Eventually, CNN has to see Piers Morgan as the low-rated liability he really is. Straight out of the gate, within hours of this massacre, CNN already is a punchline \u2026 again.Follow \u00a0John Nolte on Twitter@NolteNC",

Maybe he should\nstart talking about banning knives in England since it's become the \n\"knifing\" capital of the free world since extreme gun control laws took effect.",
