      No, but everyone in the world is looking at us and saying, "what a bunch of azzhols".  And they are right.  

And everyone else in the country besides the posters here notice that we are apparently happy to inflict suffering on a bunch of innocent people who broke no law.

          Maybe, so WHY ARE WE PUNISHING THEM?

They broke no law.
