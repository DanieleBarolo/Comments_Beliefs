There is not a single person in the country compelled to buy auto insurance. If you choose to enjoy the luxury of owning a vehicle and also choose to drive that vehicle on the public streets, than most states require you to purchase auto insurance. but it is not compulsory by virtue of being an American citizen. Now if there was a mandate that every American over the age of 26 must own a fire arm with a minimum .38 caliber, that would be comparable.

So basically, Congress passed legislation - that the president signed into law - that was good for business, good for consumers, and beneficial to the welfare of Americans. Now it's being held hostage by "Christians", libertarians and slow-thinking Republicans - as usual.

It seems this thread is full of morons.  What else to expect from a mother jones article though.


The ACA is a horrible law.  You can't simultaneously cover more people for less money, it's impossible.  You all had to lie, obfuscate and omit, to get it passed.


It's no surprise that a health care company that is making millions, and is guaranteed a bailout is playing their role as a cheerleaders for it.

PARENT COMMENT:
Liability insurance is compulsory in 49 states and the District of Columbia. New Hampshire, the only state that does not have a compulsory insurance liability law, requires that drivers be able to demonstrate that they are able to provide sufficient funds in the event of an “at-fault” accident.

A company that sells a product that the citizens are required to purchase by law thinks the law is a great thing, imagine that. It's a good time be in insurance.

  Especially car insurance.
Get back to us next time an uninsured driver crashes into you.

    Nobody is forced by the federal government to buy auto insurance.


Most states do not force you to do that either.
