  "article_body": "The majority of local sheriffs in House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s Ohio district are heading in to meet with the top house lawmaker\u2019s office on Wednesday, Breitbart News has learned.Six out of seven sheriffs of the counties that comprise Boehner\u2019s eighth congressional district of Ohio will meet with Boehner\u2019s district director Ryan Day on Wednesday at 2 PM local time.\u201cThe purpose of the meeting is to get the congressman, the Speaker of the House, together with the sheriffs of his district,\u201d Sheriff Richard K. Jones (pictured) of Butler County, Ohio, said in a phone interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re basically asking that the Speaker not bring this [any immigration bills] out of [conference] committee. If it goes to [conference] committee, the Senate\u2019s version, we do not want this version that the Senate sent over to the House to come out of the House on immigration.\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to accomplish is to put pressure on the House not to bring this bill out of the House,\u201d Jones continued. \u201cLaw enforcement, sheriffs, around the country, a majority of us, border states and non-border states, we\u2019re having issues when they come into the United States with the crime, the drugs, the same old thing.\u201dJones gave several examples of crimes that illegal immigrants have committed in Butler County, part of Boehner\u2019s district, in recent years.A 9-year-old girl was molested by an illegal, then he left and went back to Mexico. It took us six to seven years to get this individual back and he left her to run home naked in the neighborhood after he molested her. He\u2019s in prison after we got him back. There was an elderly lady where her house was broken into by an illegal who molested her then in the process made her go take a shower and clean up then drive him to the ATM machine. He was illegal. There was a lady who was hit by a vehicle and knocked down. And she\u2019s in a wheelchair. I could go on. There was another lady who was killed by a group of illegals and they left the scene and it goes on. There\u2019s killings, there\u2019s stabbings, drugs have increased coming in from Mexico. This is just Butler County, Ohio. In Ohio, it\u2019s totally out of control, the drugs that are coming in, the killings.Jones said he has been to the border twice with the sheriff of Cochise County, AZ, who serves with him in the National Sheriff\u2019s Association. \u201cWe\u2019ve started seeing that our jails are filling up with people who are committing these crimes, getting out, re-committing crimes, getting out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThen they would flee; they would leave. Then we started having them to where they were committing heinous crimes.\u201dWhile Boehner\u2019s district is about as far from America\u2019s border with Mexico as one can get, Jones said that hardly means illegal immigration and the resulting crime and economic depravity do not affect the Speaker\u2019s hometown. \u201cThe border sheriffs will tell you they come across the border but they don\u2019t stay for a minute,\u201d Jones said of illegal immigrant problems in Boehner\u2019s district. \u201cThey shift them back into the inner parts of the United States.\u201dJones said illegal immigrants are accessing welfare benefits in Boehner\u2019s district, too. \u201cOur welfare, just in Butler County, Ohio, alone\u2013there\u2019s 88 counties in Ohio\u2013in Butler County, Ohio, in our county alone, we spend $8 million a month on welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not all for people who are here illegally. But a large portion of it goes to them and their kids who are over here in the United States.\u201dThe local economy is not getting any better, either, he said, adding that illegal immigration is not helping out-of-work Americans in the eighth congressional district of Ohio. \u201cWe can\u2019t buy a job here in Ohio and we\u2019re the fastest or second-fastest growing county in Ohio,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are no jobs. And what jobs there are, we don\u2019t want them going to people who don\u2019t deserve them. We want them going to our people coming out of the military and citizens of the United States.\u201dAccording to Jones, he and his law enforcement colleagues are fed up with these issues. \u201cI\u2019ve been in media all over the country for the past seven to eight years voicing this opinion and the sheriffs here in this district, we\u2019ve all had about enough,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe want this to stop.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to come out of the House,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Senate, like I said, they\u2019re all running for president of the United States and the Republicans have sold people out. It\u2019s a pretty hot topic here in Ohio and across the nation with other sheriffs. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re having this meeting here tomorrow.\u201dJones does not know whether Boehner will slow or halt immigration efforts in the House in the wake ofLee Stranahan\u2019s investigative reporton the sudden spike of asylum requests at the border andFox News\u2019 follow-on reportsabout the Obama administration\u2019s decision to expend taxpayer resources to house such illegal immigrants in hotels. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)has called forthe House to drop any and all immigration bills until the asylum issue is addressed and stopped.\u201cWe\u2019ve never heard from the Speaker,\u201d Jones said of the issue. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out tomorrow. We believe that this is the kind of pressure that stops it. Our congressman happens to be the Speaker of the House and he represents all the United States and all the Congress.\u201cHe\u2019s got different districts that he\u2019s got to deal with. But the Republicans and the Tea Party Republicans in the House\u2013people are watching,\u201d he continued. \u201cRonald Reagan said \u2018you dance with those that burn ya,\u2019 and buddy, you better remember where you came from.\u201dWhile Boehner himself will not be attending this meeting on Wednesday, the Speaker has been more receptive than House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. For weeks, Cantor has ignored requests for a meeting from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) National Council president Chris Crane to discuss immigration legislation.Boehner\u2019s spokesman Michael Steel told Breitbart News that the Speaker \u201chopes to\u201d meet with local sheriffs soon and is upset he could not on Wednesday. Boehner has still kept the door open to a potential conference with the Senate bill and a group of House immigration bills, but in a letter Boehner wrote to the local sheriffs, he said he has a \u201cshared commitment\u201d with them \u201cto stopping the Senate bill.\u201d\u201cI look forward to keeping the lines of communication open with you and other law enforcement leaders in our community as the immigration reform debate unfolds across our country,\u201d Boehner wrote. \u201cFixing our broken immigration laws through a step-by-step, common-sense approach that begins with enforcement is critical to creating an environment for economic growth and private-sector job creation in our country, and I share your commitment to ensuring Washington at long last gets it right.\u201dJones said the sheriffs in Boehner\u2019s district represent the viewpoint of a majority of sheriffs nationwide. \u201cThis is indicative of about the whole United States,\u201d he said. \u201cSheriffs have had about all they can take. We\u2019re tired of people in the federal government saying the borders are safe.They\u2019re not. I\u2019ve been there. They\u2019re not safe. And then here inside the United States are the gangs, the killings, and the drug cartels.\u201d",
