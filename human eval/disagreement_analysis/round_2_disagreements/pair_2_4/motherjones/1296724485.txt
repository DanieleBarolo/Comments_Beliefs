Field: Notes
  Annotator 2: Context gives comments about Jews, but comment "A day ago and no response from Ms. Nancy." Do not know what that is.
  Annotator 4: Not possible to know for sure here I believe (even from full comments). Would need more information (maybe names of the commenters).

Hobby Lobby can turn American, or get the corporate death penalty. Control freak religious bigots: one of the biggest problems facing the U.S. today.

PARENT COMMENT:
That's your right. I don't shop there either, but not for either of those reasons. Curious though as to how you define "religious nuts," and how you know for sure they hate Jews. Are you sure the more correct word would be "Zionists," rather than "Jews?" Just asking.

Haven't shopped there in since I found out that they are religious nuts and hate Jews.
