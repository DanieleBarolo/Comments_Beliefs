I will bet that most of them\nare your old establishment Repubs who are threatened by the youth of the new\nreal \"conservative\" senators like Cruz. McCain, McConnell and the rest of them\ndon't want to be challenged. This is why our country is so screwed up because \nof old politicians who are hanging on to power so desperately, serving only\nthemselves. Let us clean it up and bring in NEW BLOOD of REAL conservatives.",
