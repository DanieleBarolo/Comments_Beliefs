I say whoever can prove they have an employer willing to sponsor and have NEVER collected any type of welfare and NEVER committed a crime (except being an illegal, of course), give him/her a temporary and renewable work permit and charge a fee. Everyone else should be sent back. Most Mexicans don't want to be Americans and many of them hate this country but they love to earn US dollars that they take back to Mexico so they can build their villas in their hometowns. Absolutely no citizenship!
