China stands ready to further deepen cooperation with Pakistan in various fields to bring greater benefits to the two peoples,” he added.Pakistan has decided to reconsider its relationship with the United States and “adopt a tough stance” following Trump’s comments, theExpress Tribunehaslearned, noting that Islamabad refuses to “do more” to combat terrorism in the region.The comments from allies China and Pakistan came out came in response to U.S. President Trump once again blasting Pakistan for allegedly refusing to combat jihadists who are killing and maiming American troops and their allies in neighboring Afghanistan.“The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools,” tweeted Trump. “They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help.No more!”TheExpress Tribunereports:Pakistan will highlight its sacrifices in the war against terrorism at the diplomatic front; and if the U.S. reduces or suspends aid to Pakistan or places any sanctions, the country will completely revise its relations policy with the superpower, according to sources.Pakistan, said the sources, would not accept any demands to do more, and could stop all kinds of cooperation with the U.S. The only response to any ‘do more’ demands will be ‘no more’. The future policy with the U.S. would be limited to ‘cooperation for cooperation’ and relations based on equality.Pakistani officials are expected to reach out to Islamabad’s allies, namely China, “to take them into confidence,” notes the news outlet.Speficially, Islamabad is going to “speed up the process of implementing its strategy for increasing diplomatic, trade and other relations with China, Russia and other countries,” notes theTribune.According to the Pentagon, the Afghanistan-Pakistan region ishometo the “highest regional concentration of terrorist groups in the world,” including the Taliban, al-Qaeda, their ally the Haqqani Network, and their alleged rival the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).In its most recent assessment of the war in Afghanistan, raging since October 2001, the Pentagon acknowledged that Pakistan continues to serve as a safe haven for the Haqqani Network, considered “the greatest threat” facing Americans and their allies in Afghanistan.Beijing has longconsideredIslamabad a strategic partner in South Asia despite thegrowingIslamic terrorist threat stemming from Pakistan and to a lesser extent neighboring Afghanistan.Early last month, Chinawarnedits citizens in Pakistan against potential terrorist attacks.China’s largest province, the autonomous Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang,sharesa border with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Afghanistan.Many of the Islamic terrorist attacks on Chinese soil have beenlinkedto Uighur (or Uyghur) Muslims from Xinjiang who are known to train and operate in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan.Nevertheless, Chinacontinuesto provide financial and military support to Pakistan.Both Pakistan and China consider U.S. ally India to be their regional rival.The majority of U.S. militarycasualtiesin Afghanistan have taken place in provinces at or near the country’sborderwith Pakistan.Furthermore, most jihadi strongholds in Afghanistan, including those belonging to the Afghan Taliban, al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Haqqani Network, sit on the Pakistani border.Nonetheless, Pakistan reportedly told U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis during his recent visit to Islamabad that Pakistan would not accept any dictation from the United States to enhance its efforts against jihadists in its region.Sinceunveilinghis South Asia strategy, which primarily focuses on Afghanistan, President Trump has been trying topressurePakistan into no longer providing sanctuary to terrorist groups, to no avail.The recent Pentagon assessment determined that Pakistan continues to allow terrorists to operate on its soil.Afghanistan and Pakistan have long accused one another of harboring terrorists.The Pakistani Taliban or Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — an independent group from its Afghan counterpart — is known to plan attacks in Pakistan from Afghanistan.“Sanctuary on the Pakistani side and presence on the Afghan side remain security challenges for both countries and pose a threat to regional security and stability,” conceded the Pentagon.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/01/02/china-defies-trump-pakistan-makes-efforts-sacrifices-against-terrorism/"}
