responding to active enemies or threats to the security of the home community state or nation today tyrants are restricting that right to fighting back with an unloaded firearm that is required to be kept locked in a safe in your home with no ammunition kept in the same area ever since the s the government has largely taken away from citizens the right and ability to defend their country and assure their own freedom which was the core purpose of the nd amendment the mood and intent of the drafters of our constitution is clearly demonstrated by the following when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their

hard drugs has been discredited by the many peer reviewed studies which have examined it if the gateway theory were to have any merit then alcohol and tobacco would be the true gateway drugs as nearly all have tried these before cannabis there are many factors that determine which illicit substance will be used first including availability and culture in japan where cannabis use is not popular and largely frowned upon of illicit drug users did not use illicit cannabis first in the u s since cannabis is by far the most popular and available illegal recreational substance it is unlikely that you would find many illicit hard drug users who did not encounter and use illicit cannabis first this does not mean cannabis caused their hard drug use rather it was their pre existing interest in recreational substances combined with their willingness to try illicit substances and cannabis was simply and predictably the first encountered on a related note studies have shown that cannabinoids can help treat those addicted to hard drugs and alcohol and that it is an exit drug for some if anything the prohibition of cannabis makes the hard drug problem worse once someone breaks the law to try the very popular and relatively safe drug cannabis their reluctance to try another illegal substance diminishes this is both because of their newly increased doubts of government honesty regarding the harmful effects of those substances as well and their newly reduced respect for laws against drugs in general cannabis prohibition also connects cannabis consumers to the hard drug market imagine if beer merchants also sold heroin cocaine and meth this is the situation that the prohibition of cannabis creates for its consumers it places a very popular substance into these otherwise unpopular markets strengthening them and expanding their reach also with no legal recourse to resolve disputes cannabis prohibition increases the crime associated with these markets efforts to prevent hard drug abuse are undermined and resources misspent when gateway theory is accepted as valid a recent extensive review on the subject concluded that the promotion of the erroneous gateway theory ultimately does the public a disservice including the hindering of intervention regardless one major concern is that relaxed laws will lead to significantly increased teen usage but this has not been the case

within organizations to fight back the organization must not wilt to the sjw's demands but instead make the sjws prove their accusations like most cult followers the sjws go mute after repeating their memorized lines and now must confront the intelligence side of any accusation for defensive tactics on how to fight back the embedded sjws in your org check out grace daniels' struggle with the sjws who attempted to take over her non profit organization"", ""long but worth the read heard this on alex jones interview with vox day it is a must to master and win the three r's the first thing to do when attacked by sjws is to recognize that you are under sjw attack remain calm and realize that no one else cares you need to understand that the attack is happening accept that is happening and refrain from the temptation to try to make it not be happening do not panic don't go running to others for help or sympathy don't try to convince everyone around you how outrageous or unfair the accusation is and don't explain to anyone how little you deserve the way you are being treated they don't care they really don't think about how little you cared when someone else was previously being attacked by sjws and how little you did to support them let alone take action to stop the attack that's exactly how much your colleagues and acquaintances care about you being attacked and exactly how much they are going to do to stop it the truth is that it doesn't matter why sjws are attacking you the only thing that matters is understanding that you are under attack right now and no one else is going to do anything about it don't try to reason with them the second thing is to recognize that there is no way you are going to be able to reason your way out of the situation most people who come under sjw attack have the causality backwards they think the attack is taking place due to whatever it is that they did or said that's not the case the attack is taking place because of who you are and what you represent to the sjws a threat to their narrative in most cases the sjws attempting to discredit and disemploy you already wanted you out long ago and they are simply using the nominal reason given as an excuse to get rid of you and if the attack is more the result of sjw status seeking rather than thought policing that's arguably even worse because if the motivation concerns them rather than you there is absolutely nothing you can do about it the most important thing to accept here is the complete impossibility of compromise or even meaningful communication with your attackers sjws do not engage in rational debate because they are not rational and they do not engage in honest discourse because they do not believe in objective truth they have no interest whatsoever in talking to you or trying to understand you indeed they will avoid you and do their best to minimize their communications with you while constantly talking about you and explaining the real meaning of your words and your nefarious true intentions to everyone else they will also try to isolate you and cut you off from access to any relevant authority to the media and to neutral parties the better to spin the narrative without your interference this is why it is vital that you do not agree to any confidentiality agreements or consent to keep your mouth shut while the sjw driven investigation is proceeding do not apologize the third thing to remember when undergoing an sjw attack is to never apologize for anything you have done i repeat do not apologize do not say you are sorry if anyone's feelings were hurt do not express regret remorse or contrition do not say anything that can be taken as an apology in any way just in case i am not being sufficiently clear do not apologize normal people seek apologies because they want to know that you feel bad about what you have done and that you will at least attempt to avoid doing it again in the future when sjws push you for an apology after pointing and shrieking at you what they are seeking is a confession to bolster their indictment they are like the police down at the station with a suspect in the interrogation room badgering him to confess to the crime and like all too many police these days the sjws don't really care if you did it or not they're just looking for a confession that they can take to the prosecutor be aware that once they have launched an attack on you they will press you hard for an apology and repeatedly imply that if you will just apologize all will be forgiven do not be fooled i have seen people fall for it time and time again and the result is always the same the sjws are simply looking for a public confession that will confirm their accusations give them pr cover and provide them with the ammunition required to discredit and disemploy you apologizing will accomplish nothing more than hand them the very weapons they require to destroy you accept your fate it is psychologically much easier to survive an sjw attack if you accept early on in the process that you are probably going to lose your job or be purged from your church your social group or your professional organization remember if the sjws were not confident they could take you out they would not have launched the attack in the first place they prey upon those they believe rightly or wrongly to be vulnerable even if you survive the attack it's highly unlikely that your reputation will survive unscathed as there are simply too many people who are inclined to split the difference in any conflict between two parties no matter how crazy or dishonest they know one of the parties to be be prepared to be disappointed by the behavior of some of the people you believe to be your friends but don't be angry with them or allow the anger you feel for the sjws to be displaced onto those who have disappointed you while they may have disappointed you with their cowardice they are not your problem they did not put you in the position you find yourself and they are not your enemy don't take your pain and anger out on them reserve that for the sjws document their every word and action most of the time sjw purges are committed at least partially outside the organization's established rules and forms you may not be an expert but some of the people following along will be make sure every step in the process and every piece of communication you receive from them is documented critiqued and publicized they will pull out all the stops to hide their actions in order to avoid public criticism and in some of the more egregious cases ridicule by forcing them to show their hand in public you allow others to see and understand what they are really up to this may not be sufficient to save yourself from the ongoing attack but it will almost certainly strengthen your negotiating position and will also help prevent the sjws from blithely repeating the process against you or someone else in the future whatever you do do not agree to any gag orders or sign any confidentiality agreements that will handicap your ability to use the documentation you have acquired to prevent them from spinning a narrative about what happened sjws rely on secrecy and once they know you have their actions documented they will try very hard to tie your hands in a manner that will prevent you from making that information public do not resign do not resign you must always keep in mind that their real goal is not to formally purge you but to encourage you to quit on your own that allows them to publicly wash their hands of the affair and claim that your decision to leave was not their fault they will often enlist more reasonable allies to approach you and tell you that it's not possible for you to continue any more they will appeal to your desire to avoid conflict as well as to the good of the organization and they will go on endlessly about the supreme importance of an amicable departure don't fall for it don't do their dirty work for them make them take the full responsibility for throwing you out thereby ensuring they have to suffer the unpredictable long term consequences of their actions no matter how deeply the deck is stacked against you the outcome will always be in doubt unless you resign you always have a chance to defeat them as long as you don't quit and perhaps more importantly refusing to quit buys you an amount of time that you can use to find another job before they manage to disemploy you considering how long you can reasonably expect to draw out the process which will usually take not weeks but months you will considerably enhance your chances of finding alternative employment if you do not resign do not resign there is no advantage to you in doing so as with apologizing resigning is only going to make matters worse not better despite what the sjws will promise you they'll assure you that it will be best for everyone if you just quietly resign and go away that it will be better for the organization to which your past contributions are greatly appreciated and that the one last thing you can do for it now is to avoid making an uncomfortable scene they'll promise that if you resign you'll be able to quickly and quietly put the controversy behind you and the moment you resign they will alert the media send out a statement to the entire organization and begin waving your scalp like a bloody flag this is because one of their primary goals is to maintain the illusion of their irresistible power and inevitable victory so they need to advertise their victories in order to intimidate other potential crimethinkers into falling into line so don't believe them when they tell you that a resignation will make all the pain and humiliation go away because sjws always lie and whatever you do don't resign make the rubble bounce whether you survive the attempted purge or whether you don't it's very important to observe who has defined himself as an ally an enemy or a neutral party during the process the choices people make will pleasantly surprise you about as often as they disappoint you once everyone's choices have been made clear your task is simple target the enemy at every opportunity hit them wherever they show themselves vulnerable play as dirty as your conscience will permit undermine them sabotage them and discredit them be ruthless and show them absolutely no mercy this is not the time for christian forgiveness because these are people who have not repented these are people who are trying to destroy you and are quite willing to harm your family and your children in the process take them down and take them out without hesitation if you have any sjws working under you fire them if you have an sjw relying upon you for something play dumb and assure him that he'll get it on time then fail to deliver all the while promising that it's going to be done next week above all understand that the normal rules of live and let live are no longer in effect the more you disrupt their activities and their daily routine the more difficult they will find it to purge you assume that you are on your way out if you've followed the previous advice given you should already have your landing zone prepared and are only waiting for the right moment to exit and salt the earth leave devastation in your wake so that it will take weeks or even months for them to try to recover from the damage of your purging start nothing finish everything even when the initial conflict is over the sjws are not going to leave you alone so long as they believe you to be a potentially vulnerable threat to them this is why you have to be prepared to continue to up the ante until they finally reach the conclusion that they cannot possibly beat you and they are better off keeping their distance fortunately sjws are highly emotional cowardly and prone to depression so demoralizing them tends to be considerably easier than you might imagine they will still hate you but after repeatedly meeting with staunch and confident opposition they will usually decide to leave you alone and go in search of less difficult prey reward enemies who leave you alone by leaving them in peace reward enemies who insist on continuing hostilities with disincentivizing responses that are disproportionate to their provocations and never forget no matter what they do they cannot touch your mind they cannot touch your heart and they cannot touch your soul"", 'like sjws']"

uighurs are not even native to urumqi which is in northern xinjiang the home of the uighurs is in southern xinjiang the uighurs only first started migrating to urumqi in norhtern xinjiang in the s and the vast majority of uighurs in northern xinjiang migrated during the s and s still uighurs are a small minority in urumqi as urumqi is over han chinese northern xinjiang is called the dzungharian basin again the indigenous home of the uighurs is in the south in the region called the tarim basin there were no none whatsoever uighurs in the dzungharian basin until the s the dzunghar basin is the native lands of mongol and kazakh peoples not uighurs in the mid s a long war between the mongol dzunghar khanate and the qing empire resulted in a total qing victory and the dzunghar population nearly wiped out at that time czarist russia was expanding into the region and the qing rulers concerned about russian encroachment on the depopulated dzunghar basin began to push and encourage han chinese and hui chinese muslims migration into the dzunghar basin the han chinese migrants turned an old dzunghar mongol fort into the the city of urumqi it should be pointed out that while the dzunghar basin is relatively semi arid it is surrounded by high mountains so there are many streams that flow into the basin as a result the han migrants soon turned the natural pastures of the dzunghar basin into vast agricultural tracts thus northern xinjiang dzunghar basin despite being semi arid is a rich agricultural region as the han chinese migrants began to economically develop northern xinjiang dzunghar basin it began to attract uighurs from southern xinjiang in the s however the numbers of uighur migrants into northern xinjiang remained relatively small after the chinese communist revolution the communist began to push for the economic development of northern xinjiang because northern xinjiang is very rich in resources plus it has a lot of agriculture potential so thus a new push of han migrants started in the s well not surprisiing as northern xinjiang dzunghar started to economically develop uighurs from much poorer southern xinjiang start to migrate into northern xinjiang in the s and s so the uighurs only migrated into northern xinjiang after the han chinese were already there for over years so thus today the population of northern xinjiang is nearly han chinese and less than uighur with the rest being mongol and kazakh it needs to be pointed out that the native indigenous mongol and kazakh population of northern xinjiang are very assimilated with the han chinese in fact many persons that are identified as han in northern xinjiang are actually ethnically mongol or kazakh both groups have oriental features that have been sinicized', ""just

currently de islamizing their resident muslim population to protect and defend their resident non muslim chinese citizens from the horrible evil scourge of islam and all of those that follow that very horrible evil scourge of islam furthermore while i condemn the chinese government for persecuting all true and faith based religions and their adherents at the same time i applaud china for protecting and defending their resident chinese non muslim citizens from the horrible evil scourge of islam and all of those that follow that very horrible evil scourge of islam because the last damn thing in

evidence whatsoever that can possibly validate that utterly ludicrous islam is a so called religion of peace fairy tale and an ocean of very legitimate evidence on the other hand that more than irrefutably proves way beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever that islam is and has always been a very horrible evil scourge for all non muslims in the world since the instant that menace to all civilized non muslim societies first evolved approximately years ago for instance an estimated million non muslim people million christians million hindus million buddhists and million black africans have been very brutally slaughtered in cold blood by muslims in the preceding years in a civilizational holy war that allah defines as a jihad waged preemptively against all non muslims in the world without provocation in the cause of allah by the horrible evil scourge of islam and all of those that follow that very horrible evil scourge of islam which are all mainstream orthodox muslims in the world that altogether comprise the collective islamic totalitarian world as opposed to only a tiny minority of so called radical islamist terrorists who misunderstand the beautiful religion of peace and as the open borders globalist lunatic left insists is the case to dupe and deceive the public at large so that they can continue to flood the west with millions and millions of enemy muslim invaders and conquerors masquerading as being so called moderate migrants as fast as possible and under completely false premises to eventually destroy the west from within"", 'china persecutes chinese muslims and muslims outside china gladly sell them out china considers chinese muslims as an alien dangerous culture who threaten chinese unity so they are in the process of culturally assimilating them muslims outside china consider islam to be the only true religion which allah has chosen to take over the world but islam is so backward that the economies of muslim countries are
