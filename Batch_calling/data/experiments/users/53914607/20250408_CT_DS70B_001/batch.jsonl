This shows exactly what many of us have been saying about the moral decline in American society.  For example, would someone justify a murder in one case because you thought the person that was killed \"had it coming\", but charge another case with 1st degree, because you can somehow identify with the murderer, and have a degree of empathy for him/her?  The president is not above the law.  This was true with Bush, and it is true now.  I am tired of hearing the arguments of people that are living in the past and cannot call a spade a spade when it comes to right and wrong.

Organized crime hasn't had it so good since the days of prohibition.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nhttp://armbar93.xomba.com/faux-war-drugs\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

God forbid we go back to a time when there were no blood sucking unions, and people didn't get paid 35$/hr for putting Slot A into slot B.  What you call \"poor working conditions\", could also be perceived as hard working Americans using some elbow grease to get s*it done!  American innovation flourished at this time because of \"balls to the wall\" hard work.  Also, during this time there was no income tax, we still had schools, law enforcement, roads, etc.  All of the things that we are told will go away if we don't raise taxes, existed before the income tax.

If one looks at history, the chess pieces are moving for WWIII. You have Russian expansion in the former Soviet Block nations, China flexing its muscle in the Pacific region and the Islamic nations in the Middle East. During both WWI and II Germany was looking for ways to neutralize the US. With the current administration we are effectively neutralized. My concern is our dependence on foreign support in the form of oil and many of the nations listed above having stake in our economy. We need real leadership not an empty suit.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nThe Russians are basically gangsters with nukes. Bad enough, but at least they can be dealt with in terms of self interest. China is pretty much the same. Islamists are a different species though, and far more dangerous in that they don't acknowledge any norm but their own.

If they passed a law tomorrow, saying that it was legal to ban the consumption of everything except tofu, and soy based foods, would you just throw your hands up and say, \"well, I guess I have to give up meat, veggies, and everything else that we eat, because the FDA has deemed them a health hazard.  America's laws are supposed to be in line with natural law or God's law,  and the fact that our government no longer uses God, to establish true north, when it comes to making law, or moral principles, I think it is pretty safe to say that laws are just pet projects put forth by criminals, that happen to hold elected office.  In N. Korea, it is legal, to feed political opposition to a pack of hungry dogs.  Does that make it gospel?  And lastly, the Constitution does not give congress the power to make decisions for individuals, regarding the consumption of one substance over another.  In turn, Federal drug laws are unconstitutional, as they limit choices of an individual.

These families have control of media, no bid contract war industries and the puppet government.  \"War Is A Racket\" by Major General Smedley Butler, USMC describes just some of the WW One racketeering.  In the 30s, General Butler was approached by this group to replace FDR in a coup, creating an American Mussolini, see Wiki/Bankers_Plot.  Then Senator Prescott Bush did money bundling banking for Hitler, supplying over $100 million in depression era cash to jump start Nazi war machines, see \"How Geo Bush's Grandfather Helped Hitler's Rise to Power\" in the UK Guardian.  \"The Creature from Jekyll Island\" by G Edward Griffin gives a great history of this international, multigenerational crime syndicate.  The video, \"All Wars Are Bankers War\" on youtube shows history and current attempts at starting WW Three.

When you can't eradicate a philosophy or an ideology that threatens not only the US, but our entire planet, using diplomatic intervention, eventually, you have to destroy it physically.  The Nazis were an example of this type of evil.   ISIS is another, but even Rand Paul says that we must destroy ISIS.  He just wants to do it In a responsible way, that involves Sunni boots on the ground, with US Air support, and ground troops, only as a supplement to Arab troops if needed.  If you do not know this of Paul's view on this issue, then you are missing his point.  Bottom line, there are situations that exist, that require military intervention,  even when all avenues for diplomacy  have been Exausted.  Rand knows this.

But, why don't we charge people with the crime that they are committing, and not tack on a drug charge, just for the fact that it is present.  It is not illegal to be high, it is illegal to possess the substance that makes you high.  If a parent is smoking Crack and not taking care of their kid, then there is child neglect, child endangerment, child abuse, etc.  Why do we need a possession charge?  I don't disagree with what you are saying, about the negative effects of drugs on our society, but the prohibition of these drugs do the opposite, of what they are meant to do.  Just as gun control does not rid the streets of firearms, banning of substances, does not rid the streets of drugs, it just exacerbates the problem that is there,  and creates a black market, and a criminal element that profits from the prohibition of said substances, due to supply and demand.  Drugs need regulated, yes.  But you cannot make them disappear.  You cannot legislate something out of existence.

Romney also hand pick that jackwad from Utah as an \"alternative\" to Trump so as to hopefully help Hillary win the election, and every other Hillary add on TV showed Romney calling Trump a \"phoney and a con man\"..  Plus, Romney's little name calling hissy fit not only personally insulted Trump, but he also insulted millions of Trump supporters with his childishly slanderous comments AFTER millions of Americans had already voted for Trump and he was well on his way to the nomination.. \n\nWell, so much for Trump being so \"thin skinned\" as the media insisted I suppose, but how you forgive Romney's levels of personal insults, world view policies, and establishment ties is beyond me.. And no, a groveling apology to get the job would NOT be a good start.. All that would do is make Romney look weak and wishy washy to the rest of the world right out of the gate.. Plus, every leader in the world knows what Romney's real thoughts about Trump are, and I seriously doubt that Romney would keep that a secret when behind closed doors with those leaders..      \n\nWhat about Newt, Rudy, or John Bolton, or just about anyone else other than Romney for that matter..

The problem that you have is you toss all businesses into the category of corporations, when in fact, 99.6% of American employer firms are small businesses.  Libs make the same mistake with minimum wage, while the try to punish the \"evil rich\".  They don't realize that the corporations absorb tax increases by raising prices that they charge consumers, while most small businesses do not have that luxury, and usually fold and go bankrupt because they operate on a razor thin budget, making it impossible to make drastic changes in their pricing or their staff.

And across the globe, nations with the highest homicide rates, like Brazil, have the STRICTEST gun control. While many nations with widespread armed citizenry have the lowest homicide rates, like Israel & Switzerland. Nations with strict gun control and low homicide rates had low homicide rates BEFORE the strict gun-control, like Australia. HINT: It\u2019s the culture, not the guns. If Japan issued firearms to ALL of its citizens today, there would not be a BLIP in it\u2019s low homicide rate.\n\nA note about the above news stories. The leftwing media religiously points out race any time when, and ONLY when, there is an alleged white on black incident, such as we see when a white police officer shoots a black suspect, without any evidence that race played a role, beyond the left\u2019s own prejudices.

GUNS SAVE LIVES!\n\nDahir Adan, a Somali \u201crefugee\u201d import knifed \u201cat random\u201d ten shoppers at a St. Cloud, Minnesota mall on September 17 this year, before his murderous rampage was stopped cold by an armed person who happened to be there shopping, who shot the terrorist killer dead.\n\nIn the US, the areas where the fundamental human right to self-defense (requiring the tools to exercise that right both at and away from home) is most respected, have the LOWEST homicide rates (think Vermont, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Alaska, rural America\u2026) while areas with the strictest gun control have the HIGHEST homicide rates (think Detroit, Chicago, Newark, \u2026). And across the globe, nations with the highest homicide rates, like Brazil, have the STRICTEST gun control. While many nations with widespread armed citizenry have the lowest homicide rates, like Israel & Switzerland. Nations with strict gun control and low homicide rates had low homicide rates BEFORE the strict gun-control, like Australia. HINT: It\u2019s the culture, not the guns. If Japan issued firearms to ALL of its citizens today, there would not be a BLIP in it\u2019s low homicide rate.\n\nA note about the above news stories. The leftwing media religiously points out race any time when, and ONLY when, there is an alleged white on black incident, such as we see when a white police officer shoots a black suspect, without any evidence that race played a role, beyond the left\u2019s own prejudices. So if I were to mirror that media practice as an act of protest, I would have been pointing out that in ALL the accounts above, except for the Virginia Tech massacre, the perpetrators were black and the victims non-black. But I won't.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nLiberalism is a mental illness!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Any wrongdoing that is sent to congress to for an investigation or hearing is nothing more than a dog and pony show.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Likewise you cannot sue a gun dealer because someone decides to blow their brains out as the company is not liable , the suicidal nut is.  \n\nAlso, the military cannot be used to carry out your totalitarian fantasies.  There is a little thing called The Posse Comitatus Act that has been law since just after the civil war.  You are an idiot to suggest such an action by the POTUS!\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Sessions appointed Huber, and Huber is working with Horowitz.  Huber has the power to bring charges and empanel Grand Juries anywhere in the country he so chooses.  He is operating in stealth and he is able to do so because most people don\u2019t know that he appointed a prosecutor to work with IG Horowitz, and the media is preoccupied with Russia.  Why have Huber work with IG Horowitz? Because Horowitz has no power to bring charges as IG, so he needed someone that could operate in that capacity.  Huber reports to Sessions, and there are wheels turning here.  Think logically, and don\u2019t let your emotions run away with your brain.  Patience is needed right now, and everyone calling for Sessions\u2019 head on a platter, don\u2019t seem to understand what exactly is going on.

They are ready to impose this evil on the whole nation, if they assume power again.  I have not forgotten the denouncement of God at the 2012 DNC convention.  The sounds of boooo, filled the room at the mention of His name, and it was not from a select few people.  That should have been an indication that this party does not stand for decency or compassion anymore.  I\u2019m not saying that there are no good Democrats, but I think it is apparent after the Kavanaugh charade, that Dem leadership has jumped head first into radical extremism, as the calls for violence continue to pour in from the likes of \u201cMad\u201d Maxine, Eric Holder, and other unhinged leftists.

They should not get a pass because they are buddies with the FBI Director, or because they happen to be a Democrat running for POTUS.  The problem here is not that Stone got arrested.

This guy is the worst of the worst when it comes to false prophets.  He is dangerous because he makes claims that he tries to pass off as Biblical when in fact it is the antithesis of what the word says.  You must know your Bible and it\u2019s contents, because Pete is preying on those that say they love Jesus but are unaware of what He represented in the proper context.

Obama had an ego, Washington did not.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Let me explain:\na) private schools are exempt from public school laws and costs,\nb) but vouchers take the per-pupil average funding of public schools\nc) divert it from public schools to to private schools\nd) to over-fund private schools based on costs they do not have -- guaranteeing surpluses to pocket.\n\nI propose instead we do <i><b>subsidies for private school families</b></i> which\na) are based upon private schools' operating costs\nb) go directly to families to help them afford tuition themselves\nc) do not rip off everyone else's schools.\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nSpeaking as someone who is not religious, it's my opinion that if the school meets the required legal and educational criteria, its religious or cultural roots should make no difference.

So by edit, do you mean omitting books or adding.  If you are referring to the apocryphal texts, they were omitted for multiple reasons, including the date they were written but more importantly the lack of references to them in the other recognized texts.  There were legit reasons for omitting  those books. It was not arbitrary, it was a measure taken to prevent the hijacking of scripture by bad actors looking to taint the gospels.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

And multiple presidencies with a family, would have likely occurred within the Kennedy Family if Bobby Kennedy was not assassinated.  RFK was extremely popular with the American people, spanning all walks of life. The success and maturity of Trump's children, says a lot about him as a man.

He is in your face honest, you have to at least give him some credit for being up front, consistent, and honest.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

They are in the same position as many small businesses.  The USPS operates fully and funds all pensions through the revenue that they collect from postage.  They do not operate on tax revenue dollars.  So, the fact that people are using the mail less is hurting them, because their customers and the purchase of postage on letters or packages has dried up.  Plus, they are the only method of delivery to remote (rural) places, as they provide universal delivery to every address in America.  FedEx/UPS does not.  A collapse of the USPS means that many deep rural residents will have no one to deliver mail to them.  For some USPS is the only game in town.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

However communism was a product of the 20th century, whereas the US has been at war with Islam since the Barbary Coast when Jefferson was President.  If you wanna go back further than that, Christians have been at war with these psychopaths since the Crusades.  And no, we did not provoke them.  The Crusades marked the point where Christians had had enough of Muslims and their intent on conquest, taking over countries at will while seeking establishment of an Islamic caliphate.  The Christians decided that they weren't going to lay down and allow these barbarians to take the land and kill their leaders.  The Crusades consisted of Christians fighting back, against Muslims.  So, yes, we are at war with Islam, as we have been for centuries.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

Those who don't see what is really going on or hide it will be given less damaging vaccines. The vaccines will definitely be designed to cause brain damage so they can more easily control us.

They did add to it though, similar to what the Mormons did.  I\u2019m not saying that there are not good catholic people out there, I am merely drawing attention to the  corrupt institution that is the Catholic Church.  The existence of the Catholic Church is based on a lie regarding Peter and the origin of the Catholic Church.\n\n\nThere are problems with the Roman Catholic position.  First of all, when we look at the Greek of Matthew 16:18, we see something that is not obvious in English.  \u201c\u2026you are Peter (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, petros) and upon this rock (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, petra) I will build My church\u2026\u201d Greek nouns have gender.  It is similar to the English words actor and actress.  The first is masculine, and the second is feminine.  Likewise, the Greek word \u201cpetros\u201d is masculine; \u201cpetra\u201d is feminine.  Peter, the man, is appropriately referred to as Petros. But Jesus said that the rock he would build his church on was not the masculine \u201cpetros\u201d but the feminine \u201cpetra.\u201d Let me illustrate by using the words \u201cactor\u201d and \u201cactress:\u201d  \u201cYou are the actor; and with this actress, I will make my movie.\u201d  Do see that gender influences how a sentence is understood?  Jesus was not saying that the church will be built upon Peter but upon something else.  What, then, does petra, the feminine noun, refer to?\nThe feminine \u201cpetra\u201d occurs four times in the Greek New Testament:\nMatt. 16:18, \u201cAnd I also say to you that you are Peter (petros), and upon this rock (petra) I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not overpower it.\u201d\nMatt. 27:60, \u201cand laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock (petra); and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.\u201d\n1 Cor. 10:4, \u201cand all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock (petras) which followed them; and the rock (petra) was Christ.\u201d\n1 Pet. 2:8, speaking of Jesus says that he is \u201cA stone of stumbling and a rock (petra) of offense\u201d; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed.\u201d\nWe can clearly see that in the three other uses of the Greek word petra (nominative singular; \u201cpetras\u201d in 1 Cor. 10:4 is genitive singular) we find it referred to as a large immovable mass of rock in which a tomb is carved out (Matt. 27:60) and in reference to Christ (1 Cor. 10:4; 1 Pet. 2:8).  Note that Peter himself in the last verse referred to petra as being Jesus!  If Peter uses the word as a reference to Jesus, then shouldn\u2019t we?\nIn addition, Greek dictionaries and lexicons give us further insight into the two Greek words under discussion:\nPetros:\nPetros, \u201c\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, a stone, distinguished from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (Source:  Liddell, H., 1996.

Rather, it would be built upon Jesus; and it was this truth that Peter had affirmed what he said to Jesus, \u201cYou are the Christ, the Son of the living God,\u201d (Matt. 16:16).  This is consistent with scripture elsewhere where the term rock is sometimes used in reference to God but never of a man.\nDeut. 32:4,  \u201cThe Rock!

Without these two things being done, a house majority means nothing.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

I;m not trying to make Putin out to be a good guy, but he is the only one that seems to be resisting the NWO cabal.\n\n>>> END COMMENT <<<\n\n    ### Targets ###\n    \u2022Movies\n\u2022Liberals\n\u2022Vaccines\n\u2022Christianity\n\u2022Jobs are (available | good)\n\u2022China\n\u2022Christians\n\u2022Economy is good\n\u2022Black people\n\u2022Media\n\u2022America / USA\n\u2022Nancy Pelosi\n\u2022Food\n\u2022Russia\n\u2022Scientists\n\u2022Drugs\n\u2022Jews\n\u2022Israel\n\u2022Social welfare\n\u2022Fossil fuels\n\u2022Republicans (GOP)\n\u2022Journalists\n\u2022Elites\n\u2022Woke\n\u2022Diversity\n\u2022Healthcare\n\u2022The government\n\u2022Immigration / immigrants\n\u2022Donald Trump\n\u2022Covid\n\u2022Feminism\n\u2022Gay / LGTBQ+\n\u2022Islam\n\u2022Taxes are (good | fair)\n\u2022Hillary Clinton\n\u2022Fascism / Nazism\n\u2022Military\n\u2022Democrats\n\u2022Politicians\n\u2022Music\n\u2022Ukraine\n\u2022Hobbies\n\u2022Abortion\n\u2022Sarah Palin\n\u2022Police\n\u2022Socialism / Communism\n\u2022Barack Obama\n\u2022Joe Biden\n\u2022Vegetarians / Vegans\n\u2022Sport\n\u2022Capitalism\n\u2022Kamala Harris\n\u2022Muslims\n\u2022Social media\n\u2022Climate change is (real | a problem)\n\u2022Terrorism\n\u2022Conservatives\n\u2022Crime\n\u2022White people\n\u2022Progressives\n\n    ### Task Description ###\n\n    For each target, determine the stance in the comment:\n    - If the stance is in favor of the target or agrees with the target, write FAVOR\n    - If the stance is against the target or disagrees with the target, write AGAINST\n    - If the stance is ambiguous, write NONE\n    - If the comment is not related to the target, write NOT RELATED\n\n    ### KEY CLAIM ###\n    - Extract the fundamental assertion or belief that form the basis of the commenter's stance\n    - The key claim should be expressed impersonalizing the user in the form of \"I agree with the following: <extracted claim>\".\n    - If no stance is expressed (NOT RELATED, NONE) then leave the explanation field empty. \n\n    ### Output Format: ###\n\n    You must output only JSON format:\n    {\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"target\": \"<original_target>\", \n          \"stance\": \"<one among [FAVOR, AGAINST, NONE, NOT RELATED]>\", \n          \"stance_type\": \"<one among [EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, NONE]>\",\n          \"explanation\": \"<I agree with the following: ...> if stance in FAVOR/AGAINST\"\n        },\n        // Repeat for each target\n      ]\n    }\n    \n    ONLY return the JSON object itself.\n    "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "temperature": 0}}

There are countless videos of Russian troops bringing humanitarian aid to Ukrainian families in need.  There is also video of ASOV that makes up a large portion of the Ukrainian forces, nailing a man to a cross.  The media has everything wrong here.  Ukraine has been shelling its own people for years.  We have been programmed as a society to hate Putin and Russia.  In this particular instance Putin is fighting against the NWO, Great Reset, WEF crowd.  George Soros is calling for Putin's destruction.

But now that she's gone we have lost someone who could link us with our past. \n\n<i>Western history is a story of unremitting violence and greed. There are no \u2018good old days\u2019 that can serve as a focus for redemption or a source of nostalgia. There are only the \u2018bad old days\u2019. They see the past as a source of guilt, shame and self-loathing \u2013 something for which we must apologise over and over, in a never-ending ritual of remorse.\n\nIn the UK, this art of renouncing the past has been perfected by none other than the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. In June 2020, he announced that the presence of church statues at major places of worship, from Canterbury Cathedral to Westminster Abbey, would be reviewed \u2018very carefully\u2019 to see \u2018if they should all be there\u2019. Welby was effectively calling for the cancellation of bits of his own church\u2019s history. When the head of the Church of England, an institution charged with upholding a national tradition, decides to question that very tradition, it is clear that the ruling elites have abandoned their nation\u2019s own historical legacy.</i>\n\nhttps://www.spiked-online.com/2022/09/19/the-queens-service-to-history/\n\n# Most liked comment (from the thread):\nTurn to Jesus Christ as your saviour, not some royal, or star.\n\n>>> COMMENT UNDER ANALYSIS<<<\n\n\nShe not only condoned, but took an active roll in child trafficking and sex abuse.
